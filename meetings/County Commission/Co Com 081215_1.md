| 2:44:29| Dale, here's a question that I'd like, when you're all doing the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| and, J.J., if you all be thinking about this, other commissioners at meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| we've asked about this or talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| When you're doing your draw-ups and stuff and getting your bids, can you let us know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9877)|
| 2:44:44| here's a plan A and B or C, whatever, but on those, look at the intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9884)|
| 2:44:49| whether it be here, wherever, down State Street, wherever you want to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| But if you put it over here, figure this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| I'd like to see the figure with and without a garage on here to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| make it a dual situation where, yes, we have intake, and that's for the prison and take care of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9899)|
| 2:45:05| but also to get our citizens back where the citizens can have easier access to the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9905)|
| 2:45:12| whether it's just handicapped parking or whatever, if it's one level of garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9912)|
| 2:45:16| But we still, when I ran a commission, that was a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| People do not have access to get into the building here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| And if we can, while we're doing this, because if we do put it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| this would be the last time that we could look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| You know, if it's another million dollars to add a garage level to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| then, you know, that might be more palpable on the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| But that's just, if you can look at that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| Commissioner, I think we can do that without much additional cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9940)|
| 2:45:44| partly because above ground garages is something we've built a lot of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9944)|
| 2:45:49| You know, and even if you're going to cover it up, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| I don't, you know, whichever view that you go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9952)|
| 2:45:56| But as steep as that hill is right there in the area that you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| if you do put it there, let's see what at least put one to two levels in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9959)|
| 2:46:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9966)|
| 2:46:07| And we may come back to you with other options just in regard to the size of the intake center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9967)|
| 2:46:14| and options that the sheriff would prefer to have versus things that are essential for him to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9974)|
| 2:46:20| So we'll be glad to try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| I wanted to make a comment because most of you weren't here at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9983)|
| 2:46:30| What I'm trying to avoid is something that I encountered early in my tenure here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9990)|
| 2:46:36| with the East Tennessee Historical Society building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| That building had ridden in the county's capital budget for five or six years as an $11 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9999)|
| 2:46:47| It was an $18 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| That's why I want to do the technical work so that whatever the project is that you decide you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10010)|
| 2:46:57| the numbers are really right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| So that's why this early work is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10023)|
| 2:47:04| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| Hey, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10025)|
| 2:47:06| Dale, what are you asking us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10030)|
| 2:47:11| I'm not asking you to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| Well, I mean, we're having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10033)|
| 2:47:16| I mean, I agree with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| Let's do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| I mean, what do you want us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| I mean, do you want us to approve something, not approve something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| Are you going to work on something and bring it to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| I'm just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10048)|
| 2:47:29| I guess what I meant by I'm not playing an advocacy role here in anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10049)|
| 2:47:36| What I was trying to do was say if you want a real number for the cost of the intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10056)|
| 2:47:44| whether without options, in order to have that go into next year's capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10064)|
| 2:47:52| then we need to do the technical work that I've discussed right now, like start as fast as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10072)|
| 2:48:00| And will there be a cost to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10082)|
| 2:48:03| It could be as much as $440,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| As I said a minute ago, I truly think we can do it for something closer to $350,000 or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10087)|
| 2:48:14| But I just can't commit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10094)|
| 2:48:17| We are out with an advertised RFP as of yesterday to try to select an architect so we can negotiate a firm number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10097)|
| 2:48:28| for the architectural work, the same for a construction manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10108)|
| 2:48:33| Because those two, as well as an engineering firm, are going to be the keys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10113)|
| 2:48:38| So, what we need is simply the funds to pay for that outside work that's going to be necessary to establish a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10118)|
| 2:48:49| That's if you want a budget number for this next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| If you are willing to wait an entire fiscal year, fund that technical analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10133)|
| 2:49:00| and budget development work starting next July, then you would need to put those funds in next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10140)|
| 2:49:09| And then it would not be until 2011 budget that you would have the actual facility number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10149)|
| 2:49:16| So, you're basically saying that you need $350,000, whether it's now or whether it's later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10156)|
| 2:49:22| Is that what I'm getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10162)|
| 2:49:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10163)|
| 2:49:24| To give you a firm number that I can take to the bank that we can build this thing for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10164)|
| 2:49:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10169)|
| 2:49:30| I just wanted to make sure I was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| Mr. Chairman, do we need an intake center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10174)|
| 2:49:36| Do we need to get on with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10176)|
| 2:49:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| But I also want to throw out a couple of caveats here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| I spent about two hours yesterday talking with Dr. Bill Fox at UT, the economist who deals directly with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10182)|
| 2:49:48| The state's looking at a billion dollar shortfall in sales tax, and it will probably be more before it's over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10188)|
| 2:49:54| Twenty-five percent of our budget comes from state dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| Schools primarily are the beneficiary of that, but you've also got your health department libraries and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| Schools have already cut a million dollars from their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| We're asking for a hiring freeze for the remainder of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10206)|
| 2:50:09| It's my understanding that the mayor's office is looking and may have already cut a million and a half from the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10209)|
| 2:50:15| Where I'm coming from is right now, today, to spend $350,000 on a study, I can't vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10215)|
| 2:50:24| Not in this uncertain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| We don't know what next month is going to come at us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10226)|
| 2:50:29| We don't know what's going to happen in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| But we do know, according to Mr. Troyer, if I'm correct, Mr. Troyer, and please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| that budget discussions begin next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| I mean, you're going to start in earnest in less than 30 days talking about the budget for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10238)|
| 2:50:44| Within 120 days, we're going to have a budget document in front of us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10244)|
| 2:50:50| I would be very much in favor of looking at Mr. Troyer working with the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| and the chief of police and others to make that part of our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10253)|
| 2:50:57| And let's take a look at when we have a little bit better understanding of where we're going here the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10257)|
| 2:51:03| in terms of our property tax collections and our sales tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10263)|
| 2:51:08| But to come in today or even next month and say let's appropriate $350,000 for this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10268)|
| 2:51:15| I just can't vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10275)|
| 2:51:16| Not in these uncertain economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| And so do we need it? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10279)|
| 2:51:20| Do we need to stop talking about it? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10280)|
| 2:51:22| But I think that there's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10282)|
| 2:51:24| And the process is let Mr. Troyer begin his meetings with the city and with the county in less than 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10284)|
| 2:51:30| come up with an ironclad plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10290)|
| 2:51:32| Mr. Chief Owen has just already said that he needs to go back before city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| talk with them, and see what they're going to be willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| We don't know where that's going to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| So there's too much uncertainty here to vote on something like this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10300)|
| 2:51:46| But I think that the process is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| Let's work the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| And we're going to have a document in front of us in about 90 days so that we can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| So I don't know if there's a motion on the floor, but those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| Now the resolution was deferred to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10317)|
| 2:52:01| This is just discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10321)|
| 2:52:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10324)|
| 2:52:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10331)|
| 2:52:12| In terms of a facility like this, this intake facility, is the onus on us or the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10332)|
| 2:52:22| or a combination if there is a facility to provide that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10342)|
| 2:52:27| The onus in what respect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| The cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| Yeah, cost, the financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| Well, the sheriff, this is essentially part of the jail facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10352)|
| 2:52:39| And the sheriff is, by state law, responsible for the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10359)|
| 2:52:46| So this is really would be administered by and managed by the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10366)|
| 2:52:54| But this building is kind of a hybrid because it houses city and county offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10374)|
| 2:53:04| And in terms of making a decision, I think it's already been alluded to in the prior meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10384)|
| 2:53:11| as far as making a decision what to do with this property and how it's to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10391)|
| 2:53:17| is a decision that's made jointly by the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10397)|
| 2:53:23| Okay, but in terms of the function of dealing with prisoners and their ways and means and trials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10403)|
| 2:53:31| that's the county's responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10411)|
| 2:53:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| You know, and I ask that question because I am a Knox County commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10414)|
| 2:53:41| I'm not a city anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| I represent Knox County for a piece of land that happens to lie totally within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10423)|
| 2:53:50| But my point and purpose here is to aid the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10430)|
| 2:53:56| So I think it's very, one, it's confusing and doesn't really serve us to have conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10436)|
| 2:54:06| city versus county and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| We're all Knox County commissioners, and when we make a decision, that's totally our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10448)|
| 2:54:13| Now, we can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10453)|
| 2:54:14| We can ask the Chief Owens all day if he'd like to give us money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10454)|
| 2:54:20| or Mayor Haslam if they'd like to give us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10460)|
| 2:54:23| But I really feel that it's not throwing numbers out and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10463)|
| 2:54:28| It's something that's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10468)|
| 2:54:29| If it's my job to sweep this facility up just because half of the people here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10469)|
| 2:54:36| are different than the other half or live in a certain place, it's my job to clean this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10476)|
| 2:54:42| And I think the same thing with this intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10482)|
| 2:54:47| I mean, if someone wants to step up and aid us in this process, I welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10487)|
| 2:54:52| But as we have this conversation, we all pay Knox County tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10492)|
| 2:54:58| That's nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10498)|
| 2:54:59| I mean, that's what we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| We don't deal with the other piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| So, you know, I've asked us as we go forward if we just, you know, kind of step up if we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10503)|
| 2:55:09| if it's something that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10509)|
| 2:55:10| I think everyone in here has said it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| Whether this is the time or not, you know, we can debate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10512)|
| 2:55:16| But to bring other things into this conversation, I think, is it gets us off track and it doesn't help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10516)|
| 2:55:23| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| Yeah, Dale, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| And then, Mayor, I've got a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10527)|
| 2:55:32| Could we use the design-build, and I, in the interest of full disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10532)|
| 2:55:36| I'll say that I do have friends in the design-build industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10536)|
| 2:55:40| Could we use the design-build process on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10540)|
| 2:55:43| and maybe ask for proposals, do an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10543)|
| 2:55:47| and basically say there's no guarantee you're going to get the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10547)|
| 2:55:52| but if you guys want to design something and show us what you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10552)|
| 2:55:56| and what it would cost, if it's something we can afford to do, that we will go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10556)|
| 2:56:03| Is there any way that we could use some of these design-build folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10563)|
| 2:56:07| to do some of this pre-design work for us to, you know, to where we would not pay them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10567)|
| 2:56:15| but it would be based on, you know, if you submit an affordable project that we can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10575)|
| 2:56:22| that will fulfill our needs, then we'll fund that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10582)|
| 2:56:26| Is there any way that we could do that so that this early up-front money could be alleviated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10586)|
| 2:56:34| Commissioner, I don't think this project is a terribly good candidate for design-build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10594)|
| 2:56:41| because it's so specialized and because it's punching in to an existing building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10601)|
| 2:56:48| at least once underground and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| The other thing about design-build is if when you go out with a design-build contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10611)|
| 2:56:58| you have to have done a lot of work that will also cost you money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10618)|
| 2:57:04| to specify precisely what you're asking somebody to submit that bid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10624)|
| 2:57:11| So that's fairly easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| I mean, it's like if you wanted me to build another branch library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10633)|
| 2:57:16| I can stand here and tell you what it would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| I've built eight or nine of them, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| But this is going to be a unique creature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10640)|
| 2:57:25| particularly where you're talking about locating it and how we're talking about doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10645)|
| 2:57:31| So I'll talk with my department head who's an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10651)|
| 2:57:37| but I don't think this project is a great one for a design-build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10657)|
| 2:57:45| One of the reasons that we tend to use an architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| and bring in immediately a construction manager is, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| I can get you to the same place for about the same amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10674)|
| 2:57:59| as it would cost to prepare a design-build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10679)|
| 2:58:04| and be very close to having a GMP price that we know that that contractor can build it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10684)|
| 2:58:11| So that's what we think would work the best in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10691)|
| 2:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10696)|
| 2:58:17| And the truth is most of the people that do design-builds also do CM work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10697)|
| 2:58:21| so the types of firms are not really different for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10701)|
| 2:58:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10707)|
| 2:58:28| Now, Mike, I have a couple questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10708)|
| 2:58:33| And one thing I want to make clear, you know, I mean, I am a Republican,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10713)|
| 2:58:36| and I voted for John McCain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| But with that said, we're about to have a new president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| and I've been following his policies fairly closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| I've been watching C-SPAN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| and I actually found out that recently our mayor was representing us in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10726)|
| 2:58:51| with some of President-elect Obama's people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10731)|
| 2:58:55| And one thing that I'm seeing a theme is that the president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10735)|
| 2:59:00| or the president-elect is interested in projects that are shovel-ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10740)|
| 2:59:06| that are ready to start building and infrastructure improvement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10746)|
| 2:59:11| And, again, while I may not support these new deal type policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10751)|
| 2:59:15| if that's what Washington, D.C., is going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10755)|
| 2:59:19| I want to see that Knox County gets as much of their own money back as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10759)|
| 2:59:24| And so what I'm going to ask you, Mayor, is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| do you think is this a project that we might possibly find some federal funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10766)|
| 2:59:32| with the next presidential administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10772)|
| 2:59:35| if we go ahead and do the work and have it shovel-ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10775)|
| 2:59:39| Commissioner, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| I asked that last week and got the definite impression no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10781)|
| 2:59:45| What they're looking at are funds for roads, bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10785)|
| 2:59:49| We pushed very hard for school projects, which I think they're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10789)|
| 2:59:53| I do think they're looking at infrastructure and their way of communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| with broadband networks, but I got no impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| And when I asked, I got no support associated with jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| Is there any way that we could combine an intake center with something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10803)|
| 3:00:08| Is there any way we could get outside of the box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| and maybe achieve some federal money for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10810)|
| 3:00:13| Well, I would certainly hope so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10813)|
| 3:00:14| because I think that would be certainly without question to our advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10814)|
| 3:00:19| But I think that may be a bit of a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10819)|
| 3:00:22| That doesn't mean we shouldn't try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10822)|
| 3:00:23| I just don't think the possibility is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10825)|
| 3:00:26| I'd like to toss out something else, though, while I'm here, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| I've listened very quietly and tried to listen very intently as we discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10830)|
| 3:00:34| So everyone will know where I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10834)|
| 3:00:37| We have a justice committee in place that's been meeting for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10837)|
| 3:00:41| It's looked at making things more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| It's composed of the judges, the sheriff, chief on, the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10843)|
| 3:00:47| I chair the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10847)|
| 3:00:48| They've done some really good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10848)|
| 3:00:49| The sense of cooperation among that group now is greater than it's ever been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10849)|
| 3:00:53| and we're getting some really good efficiencies in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10853)|
| 3:00:57| We do need an intake center that's more centrally located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10857)|
| 3:01:00| There is no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| And I don't want to go too far out on a limb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10862)|
| 3:01:04| but I think the sheriff and probably chief on would tell you it needs to be close to your jail facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10864)|
| 3:01:10| because if you went somewhere else, you've still got the transportation issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10870)|
| 3:01:13| and while you might save on gas, you're not going to save any on manpower by loading them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10873)|
| 3:01:17| When you look at this particular site, there are certain things you have to keep into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| and price, something you have to be very careful about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| The site work is a little more unusual here than you would have in some places and difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| and I think Commissioner Briggs referred to the infrastructure that's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10887)|
| 3:01:30| You have to make sure you don't mess up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10890)|
| 3:01:32| You have to price the facility itself in terms of how many beds, your sally port, those things that go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10892)|
| 3:01:39| You need a tunnel that is cut under the street, and that's not something you price every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| And also we've talked about putting green space on the top, which I think makes it feasible and practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10904)|
| 3:01:49| That's something we typically don't do every day here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10909)|
| 3:01:52| It's been done incredibly successfully in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10912)|
| 3:01:54| I would hope we would do it here, but it's going to be something that's difficult to price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10914)|
| 3:01:59| My thought was the first thing we would need to do is just make certain the general public would approve of a project like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10919)|
| 3:02:05| and I think Mr. Smith and his folks at PBA are holding some public hearings and have moved along down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10925)|
| 3:02:11| The second thing you need to do is have somebody that can tell you what it's going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| what size it's going to be, what it's going to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10935)|
| 3:02:19| and I think that's where you get into the architectural selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10939)|
| 3:02:23| Sheriff Jones has done a very great job of working with all of us to try and make certain that this is the right step to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10943)|
| 3:02:30| But I would encourage you to consider this as you go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10950)|
| 3:02:34| There are lots of projects out there we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10954)|
| 3:02:36| And as we begin to do projects, I hope we wouldn't do them one at a time or individually, but rather look at them collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10956)|
| 3:02:42| As I look around the room, I see the need for Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10962)|
| 3:02:47| Powell Elementary has a great number of flat tops in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10967)|
| 3:02:51| We're overcrowded in West Knoxville at a couple of locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10971)|
| 3:02:55| Our inner city schools could use some improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10975)|
| 3:02:58| I think of Bell Morris School where they're teaching art in a room that has no water and the floor is about to fall in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10978)|
| 3:03:04| I could go to each and every one of your districts and talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10984)|
| 3:03:07| We spend a lot of money on schools, but remember we've gone years without spending hardly any money on school improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10987)|
| 3:03:12| That's why I was pleased we were able to put in $15 million over the last couple of years just to aid that improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10992)|
| 3:03:18| So as you begin to look at these things, I hope you'll keep in mind that there's going to be an incredibly limited pool of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=10998)|
| 3:03:26| Let's make certain our priorities are exactly what they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11006)|
| 3:03:31| It may be very well that this is a top priority, but I would hope that we could get into the budget a little bit and look at it and make certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11011)|
| 3:03:38| But in terms of your question about President-elect Obama and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11018)|
| 3:03:41| if they're going to spend anywhere near the money that they'd be suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11021)|
| 3:03:45| I hope that each of us will work together to get our share of it back here in East Tennessee because we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11025)|
| 3:03:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11030)|
| 3:03:51| And, you know, my point, and I very strongly support these projects, this project in particular for primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11031)|
| 3:03:58| I mean, it's a project that we've needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| We've needed it for nearly ten years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| Secondly is these are tough times, and there's two benefits to tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11043)|
| 3:04:08| Number one is since the private sector is not building right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11048)|
| 3:04:13| there are a lot of folks that work in the building industry that need jobs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11053)|
| 3:04:18| And the second thing is that since the private sector isn't building right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11058)|
| 3:04:23| I think we can get some bargain basement prices because folks will fight to be the low bidder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11063)|
| 3:04:30| because if they don't get a public project, there may not be a private project to send their crew to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11070)|
| 3:04:36| So I think that governments, not just this one, but both the state and the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11076)|
| 3:04:42| I think they can get a bargain basement price right now on construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11082)|
| 3:04:48| because the private side of the industry is so slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11088)|
| 3:04:52| One thing that's also important to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| I think we have the current debt load that we can handle this project and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11094)|
| 3:04:58| But remember, when we came this year to you, there was a lot of discussion about debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11098)|
| 3:05:03| Let's take down the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11103)|
| 3:05:04| Let's take down the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11104)|
| 3:05:05| You're not taking down the debt when you do a capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11105)|
| 3:05:08| That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| It may mean that we should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11110)|
| 3:05:11| It helps stimulate the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| You're right in that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11113)|
| 3:05:14| It may certainly provide for greater efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11114)|
| 3:05:17| But this is not a cash project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| This will add to your debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11119)|
| 3:05:22| And I believe as long as we can keep our debt less than our annual budget in that neighborhood, we'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11122)|
| 3:05:29| We got a bond rating increase this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| I'm proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11131)|
| 3:05:32| Even in a difficult time, we're managing ourselves through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11132)|
| 3:05:36| Information-wise, you know we've cut back hours at our libraries and our health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11136)|
| 3:05:40| We're not seeing any fewer people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11140)|
| 3:05:41| We're just seeing more people during different hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| And we're going to continue with the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11143)|
| 3:05:45| And we're going to have to have a great deal of help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| because I think when the state starts coming down on us harder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| we're going to have to put some other measures in place to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11150)|
| 3:05:54| Commissioner Littlefield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| Mayor, you've touched on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| Dr. Briggs, you alluded to some of the points I brought up at Intergovernmental on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11160)|
| 3:06:07| And that has to do with paying for this facility if we decide to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11167)|
| 3:06:13| Mayor, I believe when you take a look out at our five-year plan that we approved in June, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11173)|
| 3:06:19| in year three we only have a little over a million dollars projected to spend on capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11179)|
| 3:06:25| We don't even begin to scratch the surface to do this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11185)|
| 3:06:31| I'm 100% in favor of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11191)|
| 3:06:35| In fact, I talked with the Sheriff J.J. Jones a few months ago in his office about the need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11195)|
| 3:06:43| And I would like to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11203)|
| 3:06:46| But we have to figure out a way to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11206)|
| 3:06:49| Can we afford the debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11209)|
| 3:06:51| Does the savings coming out of the Sheriff's Department help pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11211)|
| 3:06:57| Do we need help paying for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11217)|
| 3:07:00| You know, I hear a lot of people, you know, if it's city, county, Commissioner McKenzie talked about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11220)|
| 3:07:06| this is a county facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| It's the county's responsibility to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11228)|
| 3:07:11| And that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11231)|
| 3:07:14| Hopefully, you know, we've partnered with other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11234)|
| 3:07:18| Today, the ten-year plan on funding of a housing project for the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11238)|
| 3:07:29| And I figured up we're going to, we're looking to save in gross savings $2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11249)|
| 3:07:37| So we do need help at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11257)|
| 3:07:41| You know, our uncertain times, Commissioner Hammond talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11261)|
| 3:07:47| You know, Commissioner Pinkston has been raising the red flag about sales tax not coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11267)|
| 3:07:54| Revenues aren't quite what we'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11274)|
| 3:07:56| They're not as bad as they might be in other parts of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11276)|
| 3:07:59| But there's still some uncertainty out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11279)|
| 3:08:02| I would like to support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11282)|
| 3:08:04| But I have to have a plan, Mayor, that will, if we spend $350, $440 on a feasibility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11284)|
| 3:08:16| at the end of the day, I don't want to just spend that money and say, gosh, we can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11296)|
| 3:08:23| If we're going to spend that kind of money, we need to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11303)|
| 3:08:27| And I guess between now and January when we're going to vote on this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11307)|
| 3:08:33| I need to see a plan that says if we decide to build it, we can build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11313)|
| 3:08:39| Mayor, can you answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| Well, Commissioner, that's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11321)|
| 3:08:44| I think what you would need to do as this goes forward, out of those plans that you're spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11324)|
| 3:08:49| you should get at least some conceptual drawings that shows what it's going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11329)|
| 3:08:53| how large it's going to be, and ease some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| That would also help you price it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11336)|
| 3:08:57| You can't price it until you know the size of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| So those are some things that we'd move down that path on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11339)|
| 3:09:02| And we can come with a plan that would show how that would work and some more well-defined dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11342)|
| 3:09:08| I think we can do that by our January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11348)|
| 3:09:11| I'm not sure if that's moved up or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| But what I would hope we do is to look at this project in context with everything that we're proposing to do in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11353)|
| 3:09:19| see where it lines up as the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11359)|
| 3:09:21| You can determine if it's the top priority, if there's another facility that should be higher on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11361)|
| 3:09:26| Well, I guess, Mayor, because we're probably going to be a couple of years out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11366)|
| 3:09:34| if our projections are that in two years, because this is year one and year three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11374)|
| 3:09:39| we only have a little over a million dollars that we can spend on a capital project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11379)|
| 3:09:44| we don't have any money to build a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| We don't have money to build an intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11386)|
| 3:09:48| We don't really have the money to even build a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11388)|
| 3:09:52| How are we going to do any of these very important capital projects that are out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11392)|
| 3:09:58| Keep this in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11398)|
| 3:09:59| If you don't want to add to your debt, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11399)|
| 3:10:02| If you want to add to your debt, as Commissioner Lambert was referring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11402)|
| 3:10:06| there are a lot of things changing, including interest rates, which you can borrow money for virtually nothing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11406)|
| 3:10:11| So perhaps some other infrastructure projects could be covered in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| We pushed very hard last week to have schools included as a part of the recovery package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11415)|
| 3:10:21| not just roads and bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| We have, and I've discussed this with Dr. McIntyre, while we may not be shovel ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11423)|
| 3:10:28| we can be close pretty quick if the school board would give us a capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11428)|
| 3:10:33| We can be shovel ready very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11433)|
| 3:10:36| And the new administration, that was a term they used repeatedly, over and over, be shovel ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11436)|
| 3:10:41| I've asked Mr. Weichert to give me a list of projects as it relates to other infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11441)|
| 3:10:45| Certainly, if you have projects in your districts, things you'd like to be considered, pass those along to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11445)|
| 3:10:50| because basically what's going to be happening, we need to make certain we have our fair share of this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11450)|
| 3:10:55| And if we're sitting here debating it, I don't know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| But to answer your question, you're right on the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11458)|
| 3:11:00| But as you also well know, those capital plans change every single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11460)|
| 3:11:03| And that's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| So as we look at what the revenues are as we get into our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11465)|
| 3:11:08| and we look at what state support may be cut or reduced or eliminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| what federal support we may receive, then we'll have a much better idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11471)|
| 3:11:15| And that's what I'm asking, Mayor, is that before I can vote to spend money on a feasibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11475)|
| 3:11:20| I have to know that out in the future, at the end of the day, if we want to build this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11480)|
| 3:11:26| we have a plan to fund it and actually build it and not just talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11491)|
| 3:11:32| And we shouldn't be doing it and just talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11492)|
| 3:11:34| That would be a waste of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11494)|
| 3:11:35| But we also need to look at what we can do with our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| and other infrastructure that's out there that need improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11498)|
| 3:11:41| and where we can reach out for funding that comes from a variety of sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11501)|
| 3:11:44| to perhaps put a package together to keep us moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11504)|
| 3:11:48| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11508)|
| 3:11:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11510)|
| 3:11:52| I guess being in law enforcement and being on commissions kind of gives me a benefit on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11512)|
| 3:12:00| You know, I don't know that there's anybody in here that debates whether or not we need an intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11520)|
| 3:12:08| Yes, it does need to be downtown connected to this building, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11528)|
| 3:12:12| because if you're just transporting them from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11532)|
| 3:12:15| suggestions of being the old Sears building on Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11535)|
| 3:12:17| well, you're still going to transport them down here for court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11537)|
| 3:12:21| You know, suggestions of the old safety building jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| I can tell you the safety building jail is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11543)|
| 3:12:26| The old intake center down here wouldn't pass accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11546)|
| 3:12:31| So, you know, one of our other options is using part of the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11551)|
| 3:12:36| and nobody wants to get rid of any parking space down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11556)|
| 3:12:39| So, I think, you know, some people, being in law enforcement, you hear about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11559)|
| 3:12:46| we've talked about dealing with misdemeanors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11566)|
| 3:12:50| We've talked about dealing with getting people out of our jail as quick as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11570)|
| 3:12:55| The public will be very alarmed to know that the people that walk away from certain situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11575)|
| 3:13:00| with a citation versus going to jail currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11580)|
| 3:13:04| And I don't know that, I hope that we don't have to get to the point where we're cutting people loose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11584)|
| 3:13:09| with a citation when they really need to make a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| And not a 34-mile trip, but a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11592)|
| 3:13:17| But I think it's very important that this intake center is worked on fairly quickly because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11597)|
| 3:13:26| we were all elected mostly based on, hey, I'm for the schools, I'm for public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11606)|
| 3:13:32| And this is a public safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11612)|
| 3:13:35| The quicker that, if it takes an officer three hours to do paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| and get somebody transported to the intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| that's three hours that that area may not be covered as efficiently and effectively as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11621)|
| 3:13:46| And if we improve public safety, we improve the overall living conditions of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11626)|
| 3:13:53| And I think this is a no-lose proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11633)|
| 3:13:56| And we were talking about funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11636)|
| 3:14:00| We just raised the litigation tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11640)|
| 3:14:04| And the sheriff just told everybody we could use part of his savings, some of his savings to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11644)|
| 3:14:09| I believe I may not be misspeaking, Sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11649)|
| 3:14:12| but use part of the savings toward paying off the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11652)|
| 3:14:17| Mr. Smith, I do have a few questions, and it's out of not knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11657)|
| 3:14:22| You said we have to bring in a construction manager for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11662)|
| 3:14:25| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| Well, what that would do is while the architects design and estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11667)|
| 3:14:34| we found the architect's estimates not to be very valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| And so either by bringing a construction manager on board right in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11677)|
| 3:14:43| or in some cases we've used independent estimators, the cost there is about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11683)|
| 3:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11688)|
| 3:14:49| Don't you have project managers on your staff currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11689)|
| 3:14:54| Down to two, but yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11694)|
| 3:14:55| What projects are we working on right now besides Tommy Shumpert Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| Oh, Shumpert Park, finishing up Carter Senior, Seven Islands Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11699)|
| 3:15:05| which is my project for the rest of my life, I guess, due to the permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11705)|
| 3:15:11| My senior project manager is just coming out of the ground with the city's transit center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11711)|
| 3:15:17| right down on Church Viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11717)|
| 3:15:19| So there are a handful of others we've got to build out to do at the Family Investment Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11719)|
| 3:15:25| for the Department of Children's Services, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11725)|
| 3:15:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11728)|
| 3:15:29| Small stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11729)|
| 3:15:30| Virtually everything but the transit center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11730)|
| 3:15:31| Except for transit, it's pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| As far as Carter, we've already cut the ribbon and it's being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| It's just a matter of closing out the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11737)|
| 3:15:38| There's just a couple of remedial things that have got to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11738)|
| 3:15:41| What does the PBA charge the city and the county, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| the county for a project such as this for a project manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11744)|
| 3:15:48| It's usually run between 2% and 2.5% depending on the cost of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11748)|
| 3:15:54| Let's just say that ABC Construction Company got the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11754)|
| 3:15:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11758)|
| 3:15:59| ABC Construction Company is going to charge us, obviously, a fee for the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11759)|
| 3:16:04| and then the PBA is going to charge the county on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| I'm an outsider looking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11767)|
| 3:16:10| That's a duplication of fees to me, and I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11770)|
| 3:16:16| You don't, and that's the right answer because our role is not as a construction manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11776)|
| 3:16:23| Our role is as an owner's rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11783)|
| 3:16:26| I think when you talk to Chief Bivens about the role we played| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11786)|
| 3:16:30| in building the most recent pod out at Maloneyville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11790)|
| 3:16:34| and the role we played in any of the projects we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11794)|
| 3:16:38| trust me that the architect and the contractor on a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11798)|
| 3:16:42| are incented to have the job be as big as it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11802)|
| 3:16:45| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11805)|
| 3:16:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11806)|
| 3:16:47| Our job is to push back in the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| Our role is a very different role than a constructor or a construction manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11809)|
| 3:16:55| What was the last pod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11815)|
| 3:16:57| Was it built a no-bid process or was it built with a bidded process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11817)|
| 3:17:01| It was built with a construction manager process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11821)|
| 3:17:04| wherein we competitively select a construction manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11824)|
| 3:17:07| and then all the work below them is hard bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11827)|
| 3:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11832)|
| 3:17:13| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11833)|
| 3:17:15| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11835)|
| 3:17:18| Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11838)|
| 3:17:25| First of all, Mr. McKenzie, I know it's the county's responsibility for a jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11845)|
| 3:17:31| but what I'm trying to do is save the city of Knoxville taxpayers money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11851)|
| 3:17:35| this $340,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| If they would just give a little of that to this, it could help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11857)|
| 3:17:41| Sheriff, building a pod out there at that detention facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11861)|
| 3:17:45| is not going to solve our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11865)|
| 3:17:47| It's not going to solve the problem with the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11867)|
| 3:17:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11870)|
| 3:17:51| Now, what we're doing, and you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11871)|
| 3:17:54| we're throwing out $800,000 to a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11874)|
| 3:17:57| just like throwing it out there on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11877)|
| 3:17:59| striking a match to it and burning it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| We're not getting a thing in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| Absolutely nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11883)|
| 3:18:04| Now, if we could get you to give your money back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| the money you save on transportation toward just bonded indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11887)|
| 3:18:11| Which I've agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11891)|
| 3:18:12| And if the city council would vote to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11892)|
| 3:18:14| that would probably pay for any bonded indebtedness we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11894)|
| 3:18:17| And after this building is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| the city taxpayers are going to save a lot of money just like the county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11899)|
| 3:18:24| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11904)|
| 3:18:26| We need to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11906)|
| 3:18:27| I represent both city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11907)|
| 3:18:30| I'm one of the very few commissioners up here that do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| But I try to take care of everybody's tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11912)|
| 3:18:35| and what I'm saying is we've wasted I don't know how many millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11915)|
| 3:18:40| by not doing this in 98 when we had a $0.55 tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11920)|
| 3:18:45| And now is the time to do it because this project will probably pay for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11925)|
| 3:18:52| And also, and this is what I want to leave you with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11932)|
| 3:18:55| it also will help alleviate the overcrowdedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11935)|
| 3:18:58| I can tell you that 14 months ago we opened a facility that had 204 beds in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11938)|
| 3:19:05| It was our decision at the sheriff's office to add 96 beds to that detention pod for a total of 300 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11945)|
| 3:19:15| As of right now, we have 52 beds open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11955)|
| 3:19:19| Out of those 300 beds we added, this morning we had 52 beds open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11959)|
| 3:19:25| Now, I can assure you when a federal lawsuit is filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11965)|
| 3:19:29| and they put a cap on that building out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| we'll come up with $5,000 a day per prisoner for every one we go over that limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11971)|
| 3:19:37| This is not only to solve the transportation problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11977)|
| 3:19:40| this is to help with the overcrowding of the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11980)|
| 3:19:42| It's a twofold project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| That's happened several times, hasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| It has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11986)|
| 3:19:47| Dale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11987)|
| 3:19:52| You know, Commissioner Lutho was talking about how we can pay for this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11992)|
| 3:19:55| There's no way we can pay for it until we get this study on what it's going to cost us, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=11995)|
| 3:20:00| There's no way we can figure out how we're going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12000)|
| 3:20:03| Well, that's kind of the dilemma, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12003)|
| 3:20:07| What you've seen in maybe a more recent example was the, quote, $40 million high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12007)|
| 3:20:14| Well, it's a $50 million high school because $40 million wasn't really enough to build it as big as the school board needed it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12014)|
| 3:20:22| So that's what I'm trying to avoid is how do I get you a number that you can really look at in the eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12022)|
| 3:20:29| and say, can I pay for that and how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| But we have to give the money for this study before you can come up with that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12031)|
| 3:20:36| And then we have to arrive at how we're going to pay for it if we're willing to go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12036)|
| 3:20:39| But we have to do the study first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12039)|
| 3:20:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12041)|
| 3:20:42| And I'm not trying to be aggressive here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12042)|
| 3:20:46| Like I said, you could do the study now and you'd have that number for next year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12046)|
| 3:20:51| or you can wait until next year and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12051)|
| 3:20:55| But then you won't have the number until the following year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12057)|
| 3:20:58| So what would we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12058)|
| 3:20:59| If we don't come up with this feasibility study, we're postponing this for another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12059)|
| 3:21:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12063)|
| 3:21:05| Essentially, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12065)|
| 3:21:06| Unless you do some mid-year adjustment, which is pretty uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12066)|
| 3:21:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12070)|
| 3:21:11| And that's another million dollars roughly that we've wasted of the taxpayers' money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12071)|
| 3:21:14| and transportation costs plus a possibility of being overcrowded in the penal farm out there at a $5,000-a-day fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12074)|
| 3:21:25| I think we need to go ahead and fund this feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12085)|
| 3:21:29| And then, if it comes back, if we can afford it, do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12089)|
| 3:21:34| If we can't find the money, we don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12094)|
| 3:21:36| But we can't do anything until we do this feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12096)|
| 3:21:41| You can't give us any figures at all until we do that, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12101)|
| 3:21:44| None that are any better than the $12 million or $15 million people are throwing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12104)|
| 3:21:50| I don't even know where those came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12110)|
| 3:21:53| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12113)|
| 3:21:54| You might come back and say it takes $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| You might come back and say it takes $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12118)|
| 3:21:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12119)|
| 3:22:00| It could be less than those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12120)|
| 3:22:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12121)|
| 3:22:02| That's the reason why we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12122)|
| 3:22:03| We've got the money right now in this budget right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12123)|
| 3:22:07| Now, the $3 million that we have left over here in last year's budget is not affecting this year's budget whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12127)|
| 3:22:17| We're going to be, when we get our money for the Galbraith School over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12137)|
| 3:22:21| that's $300,000 that we're putting into this budget over above our regular revenues that we weren't anticipating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12141)|
| 3:22:29| We've got $119,000 for the South School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12149)|
| 3:22:32| The Galbraith School sold for $199,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12152)|
| 3:22:35| So, if you wanted to take that money, that would pay for the feasibility study roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12155)|
| 3:22:41| So, this is a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| I just can't see you keep wasting a million dollars roughly a year out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12163)|
| 3:22:48| Plus, if next year we do this feasibility study, it may cost more too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12168)|
| 3:22:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12174)|
| 3:22:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12175)|
| 3:22:56| The one argument for moving more quickly was made by Commissioner Lambert and was made accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12176)|
| 3:23:06| I can tell you, for example, in the Transit Center, my project manager saved $75,000 on one line item, and that was for rebar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12186)|
| 3:23:17| Steel is going south almost as quickly as it went north a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12197)|
| 3:23:25| So, you are operating for some period of time, and I'd say the next year or so at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12205)|
| 3:23:31| in an environment where the economy is really ugly and the construction industry is very hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12211)|
| 3:23:38| And so, that's just a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12218)|
| 3:23:42| This could work to our advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12222)|
| 3:23:43| Well, roughly the million dollars a year we're saving, you know, that's still going to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12223)|
| 3:23:49| We've got people, I think, in Farragut and West Knoxville and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12229)|
| 3:23:52| they're hauling crimes up and down there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12232)|
| 3:23:55| They're wanting more officers on the road and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12235)|
| 3:23:58| I just think that we need to go ahead with this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12238)|
| 3:24:04| I want to, Paul, you had asked a question of the law director about using funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12244)|
| 3:24:09| and the law director can answer that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12251)|
| 3:24:12| Commissioner, the resolution that was passed in November of 2007 on the application of funds from the sale of school facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12252)|
| 3:24:25| defined facilities as any building and or property used or previously used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12265)|
| 3:24:35| So, it would include those properties then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12275)|
| 3:24:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12279)|
| 3:24:40| That was my resolution, but I didn't remember using that word previously in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12280)|
| 3:24:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12288)|
| 3:24:50| Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12290)|
| 3:24:53| I just wanted to make a couple of observations in the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12293)|
| 3:24:56| I realize this is going to go on for quite a while into the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12296)|
| 3:25:01| One, and this is in response and sort of dovetails with Mr. McKenzie's and Mr. Pinkson's comments about the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12301)|
| 3:25:09| and that is that we certainly need to be careful when we start to think about asking the city to do this, the county, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12309)|
| 3:25:18| I think the city residents, isn't that a form of double taxation somewhat to ask them to pay for through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12318)|
| 3:25:26| via whatever department it is, to pay for something such as a study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12326)|
| 3:25:32| I think we're asking them to bear the burden that they probably shouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12332)|
| 3:25:37| based on them already being taxed within the county, but that's an issue to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12337)|
| 3:25:43| Another observation has to do with, I hope at least within the discussion, there is this consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12343)|
| 3:25:51| and I'm sure that the existing facilities, and it just begs the question to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12351)|
| 3:26:00| what was going on in 1998 when we moved the intake center to Maloneyville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12360)|
| 3:26:07| I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12367)|
| 3:26:08| I think that in retrospect, of course, it has been a very, very unwise decision, a very large mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12368)|
| 3:26:17| I don't know who all are responsible for that, but I wish they could pay for it in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12377)|
| 3:26:22| And then, simultaneously, the facilities that exist right now downstairs, in terms of the Sally Port, are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12382)|
| 3:26:36| I'm sure they can't be accredited, but in the process of doing our consideration about what to do for an intake facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12396)|
| 3:26:44| I think that facility should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12404)|
| 3:26:47| And retrofitting that facility, I'm sure, would be a task to make sure how the prisoners are taken in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12407)|
| 3:26:54| and processed and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12414)|
| 3:26:55| That would be a very large deal, and it would require lots of adjustment by law enforcement and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12415)|
| 3:27:02| you know, women prisoners, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12422)|
| 3:27:04| But I think that that should be one of the variables that we should consider in this total process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12424)|
| 3:27:15| Do you want to respond to that, Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| Yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12437)|
| 3:27:18| I want to make sure you understand that in 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12438)|
| 3:27:20| I had absolutely nothing to do with moving the intake center out to Maloneyville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12440)|
| 3:27:25| I want to go on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12445)|
| 3:27:26| I knew that, and I should have made note of that in my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12446)|
| 3:27:33| I do have a question, I guess, though, for Dale Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| I was going to say, let me answer the part about retrofitting downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12456)|
| 3:27:40| The problem that we run into with that is that the downtown facility has been certified now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12460)|
| 3:27:46| I guess the best word is grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12466)|
| 3:27:49| Anything that we do to that structure to change it from the way it is right now means that we would have to bring that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12469)|
| 3:27:57| to the codes of today's standards, which would be millions and millions and millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12477)|
| 3:28:04| So we looked at that, and Dale can speak a little bit more to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12484)|
| 3:28:07| We even looked at putting the intake center on L3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12487)|
| 3:28:10| and bringing them through the middle double doors on L3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12490)|
| 3:28:14| There's no way to make an elevator shaft the way the building is built structurally that we can get the prisoners up to L2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12494)|
| 3:28:23| So we spent a lot of time looking at that kind of option to try to keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12503)|
| 3:28:28| and to do something with it here in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12508)|
| 3:28:31| And it just wasn't cost effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12511)|
| 3:28:34| But he can speak a little bit better to that than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12514)|
| 3:28:36| Commissioner Norman, can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12516)|
| 3:28:40| Paul, just a real comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12520)|
| 3:28:43| We're going to discuss all of this again in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12523)|
| 3:28:46| and everybody's going to get a chance to talk tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12526)|
| 3:28:48| Everybody's got their light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12528)|
| 3:28:49| But we've been on this for a while for an item that has been deferred until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12529)|
| 3:28:54| So we can keep bringing everybody up and continue to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12534)|
| 3:28:59| But I just wanted to remind that this is an item that's been deferred until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12539)|
| 3:29:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12544)|
| 3:29:05| I've still got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12545)|
| 3:29:06| I think it would be helpful for Mr. Smith to go ahead and kill the issue, if he would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12546)|
| 3:29:10| of retrofitting the sally port downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12550)|
| 3:29:13| We won't have to talk about that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12553)|
| 3:29:18| While we didn't cost any alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12558)|
| 3:29:21| we did find that putting the full-blown intake center in a retrofitted building inside the CCB just was not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12561)|
| 3:29:32| Structurally, we encountered serious problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12572)|
| 3:29:35| I'm not even familiar with the accreditation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12575)|
| 3:29:38| but there's no doubt that what the sheriff said is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12578)|
| 3:29:41| that you would blow up accreditation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| and spend millions retrofitting everything in the current jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12583)|
| 3:29:48| We didn't even bother once we realized it was going to necessitate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12588)|
| 3:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12593)|
| 3:29:57| Are you done, Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| Commissioner Dow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| Thank you, Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12601)|
| 3:30:02| I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12602)|
| 3:30:03| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12603)|
| 3:30:04| We've been on it a while and probably will be debating it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12604)|
| 3:30:07| I support this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| I think I'm sort of ready to move forward on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12609)|
| 3:30:12| I see the merits of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12612)|
| 3:30:15| It's rare that anything a community, a city, county, or state, or whatever does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12615)|
| 3:30:21| put it on a balance sheet and it pays for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| I mean, a school or a park or a street paving certainly don't pay for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12623)|
| 3:30:27| We put them on balance sheets, but they're very necessary parts of our existence as governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12627)|
| 3:30:33| I think this would, if it's done right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12633)|
| 3:30:35| and I would like to ask the sheriff and Mr. Troy when they do their joint study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12635)|
| 3:30:39| Again, I mentioned this at the committee the other day to look and see how it cranks out using a $1.50 gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12639)|
| 3:30:45| and look at how it cranks out at $4 a gallon gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12645)|
| 3:30:48| There certainly would be a much bigger savings at the higher end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12648)|
| 3:30:52| I don't wish gas would go back, but I speculate it probably will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12652)|
| 3:30:58| I support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12658)|
| 3:31:01| And let me just mention, we're talking about 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12661)|
| 3:31:03| I did not at that point nor will I can conceive of supporting the big, massive $250,000,000,000,000 center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12663)|
| 3:31:11| over on State Street or wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| I think that was called the Justice Center Project, and that's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12673)|
| 3:31:16| But I did not support that and cannot imagine supporting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12676)|
| 3:31:21| You know, sometimes you've got to spend money to make money, they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12681)|
| 3:31:24| Maybe not in today's economic climate, but you've got to spend money to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12684)|
| 3:31:29| And I believe we could put this one on a balance sheet and almost make it revenue neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12689)|
| 3:31:36| and particularly throwing in the 20 new officers, or not new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| but the officers that would free up the sheriff to put out there in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12699)|
| 3:31:43| Of course, that's impossible to quantify and put on the balance sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12703)|
| 3:31:46| but it's certainly more efficient than driving people around and burning up gasoline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12706)|
| 3:31:51| and polluting the air and getting us, you know, just wearing out cars and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12711)|
| 3:31:56| So I support this concept, and I believe we could, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12716)|
| 3:32:00| I'm commenting on the mayor's comment about debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12720)|
| 3:32:02| I'm sort of a debt hawk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| I don't want to see more debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12724)|
| 3:32:05| You know, we do have the capacity and debt's rolling off, and as the vice chairman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12725)|
| 3:32:10| I think we only have $1 million or so in the last year of the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12730)|
| 3:32:14| In year three of our five-year plan, which we're in year one, so we're two years away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12734)|
| 3:32:18| But if we could, I'd like us to analyze with a magnifying glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12738)|
| 3:32:22| seeing if this could become somewhat revenue neutral when you put in the cost savings of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12742)|
| 3:32:28| of the savings on gas and the manpower putting those guys back on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12748)|
| 3:32:33| I think it's a good concept, and I look forward to working on it in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12753)|
| 3:32:39| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12759)|
| 3:32:42| You know, I've listened to a lot of things here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12762)|
| 3:32:44| and it sometimes seems like whatever project we're discussing is the most urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12764)|
| 3:32:49| And I agree with the mayor very much that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12769)|
| 3:32:52| there's a lot of other very important projects that we need to do, such as the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12772)|
| 3:32:55| But I also agree completely with what we've said about having this intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12775)|
| 3:33:00| There's a couple of points I wanted to make because we're talking about paying for the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12780)|
| 3:33:05| Let's not forget that in October we passed a $50 litigation tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12785)|
| 3:33:11| and that had $25 of that 50 must go to jail construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12791)|
| 3:33:17| and $25 of that was to go to courthouse security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12797)|
| 3:33:22| I believe that we could combine both of those together for the entire $50 to go to jail construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12802)|
| 3:33:28| since they probably could be construed as being related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12808)|
| 3:33:34| I think that the law director, at the time that we passed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12814)|
| 3:33:37| estimated that we would get between a million and a million and a half dollars in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12817)|
| 3:33:42| If that were indeed the case, and that's money that I hate earmarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12822)|
| 3:33:47| but that's money that is earmarked only for those two types of projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12827)|
| 3:33:53| and we could use that just for the jail construction project and we can't use it for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12833)|
| 3:33:58| So the schools and a lot of these other very worthy projects that merit our attention are not competing with those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12838)|
| 3:34:07| and those dollars can only be spent on the jail project is my interpretation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12847)|
| 3:34:12| So if we were looking at how we were going to pay for the estimated $12 million project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12852)|
| 3:34:17| we could pay for this in ten years or less and not be competing with capital dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12857)|
| 3:34:22| for these other very worthy projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12862)|
| 3:34:25| And that was really the point that I was trying to make on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12865)|
| 3:34:29| The second point is that I really do believe in sticking to our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12869)|
| 3:34:33| unless we can really find the money someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12873)|
| 3:34:37| But still, I hate to go into the general fund to start this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12877)|
| 3:34:43| But I think we can pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12883)|
| 3:34:45| We can prioritize it at a higher level because those dollars can only be used for jail construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12885)|
| 3:34:49| and courthouse security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12889)|
| 3:34:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12893)|
| 3:34:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12894)|
| 3:34:55| A correction on the litigation fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12895)|
| 3:34:59| By state law, $25 goes to courthouse security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12899)|
| 3:35:02| This body agreed to allocate $25 for school construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12902)|
| 3:35:08| I thought I was correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12908)|
| 3:35:11| He just pulled the resolution and that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12911)|
| 3:35:13| That's what this body voted to do was to take the $25 to make it for school construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12913)|
| 3:35:17| So unless we can redo it, if this is the body's wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12917)|
| 3:35:22| or if you could somehow make the case that courthouse security would be improved by having the intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12922)|
| 3:35:28| then that may be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12928)|
| 3:35:30| But I guess the bottom line is I don't see anyone standing up and saying we don't need an intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12930)|
| 3:35:37| I haven't heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12937)|
| 3:35:38| So that option to me, that debate is not even a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12938)|
| 3:35:42| The debate is we need a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12942)|
| 3:35:45| We don't have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12945)|
| 3:35:47| And so that's why I think it's prudent for Mr. Troyer to begin his discussions with the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12947)|
| 3:35:52| and with the police chief and let's get a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12952)|
| 3:35:55| Come to us with a plan on what it's going to cost, how we're going to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12955)|
| 3:35:59| I see nothing wrong with asking the city to help pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| I see nothing wrong with asking the town of Farragut to kick in some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12961)|
| 3:36:04| I mean, it doesn't hurt to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12964)|
| 3:36:06| All they can do is say no and then we can come back and see what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12966)|
| 3:36:09| But I think that we need the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| Now, can we get the plan by January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12971)|
| 3:36:14| Maybe we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12974)|
| 3:36:15| Maybe we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12975)|
| 3:36:16| But nonetheless, I feel like that as these discussions go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12976)|
| 3:36:19| I think that the plan is going to be key as we look in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12979)|
| 3:36:24| For example, we've already gone from $440,000 now to $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12984)|
| 3:36:28| It might even be less than that once they start, you know, looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12988)|
| 3:36:31| and seeing, you know, exactly what's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12991)|
| 3:36:33| So I would ask that, you know, we get the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12993)|
| 3:36:36| If you're not comfortable with the plan in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12996)|
| 3:36:38| then I have no problem waiting until February or whenever we can get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| until we get a good plan for us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13002)|
| 3:36:45| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13005)|
| 3:36:46| Just real quick, is the criminal court clerk collecting those fees now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13006)|
| 3:36:52| Are they aware that they're supposed to be collecting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13012)|
| 3:36:54| I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13014)|
| 3:36:55| I guess that goes to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| Yes, they are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| So that money is coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13019)|
| 3:37:02| Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13022)|
| 3:37:03| The law that I think Commissioner Briggs was talking about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13023)|
| 3:37:07| and the way it reads is that this money is not to exceed $10 per case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13027)|
| 3:37:11| but the proceeds shall be used exclusively for the purposes of jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13031)|
| 3:37:14| or workhouse construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13034)|
| 3:37:16| I think that's the bill that he's speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13036)|
| 3:37:18| These fees of $25 per case could be used for jail or workhouse construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13038)|
| 3:37:25| And that was what we brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13045)|
| 3:37:28| And the law director said that he felt like that we didn't need to use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13048)|
| 3:37:32| for jail construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13052)|
| 3:37:33| That was the original proposal I had brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13053)|
| 3:37:35| Those are two separate statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13055)|
| 3:37:37| These are two separate statutes because this one says to be used exclusively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13057)|
| 3:37:41| for the purpose of jail or workhouse construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13061)|
| 3:37:44| That's the one I was just showing you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13064)|
| 3:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13067)|
| 3:37:48| I think that's the one Commissioner Briggs was speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13068)|
| 3:37:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13070)|
| 3:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13071)|
| 3:37:52| Well, what I'm hearing here is, like Commissioner Hammond said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13072)|
| 3:37:55| I think the majority of us, if not all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13075)|
| 3:37:58| feel like we need to take a look and see if we can afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13078)|
| 3:38:02| I think there's some very good possibilities that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13082)|
| 3:38:05| I think, at least in my mind, I am for the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13085)|
| 3:38:09| I just need to see that we can actually buy it, can afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13089)|
| 3:38:14| So let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13094)|
| 3:38:16| So after this debate, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13096)|
| 3:38:18| Have we directed Deb Smith to bring us a number of what it's going to cost us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13098)|
| 3:38:24| to have the study to tell us what it's going to cost and the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13104)|
| 3:38:29| Well, right now it's been deferred until January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| so that more information can be brought before this commission as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13112)|
| 3:38:38| and this is what I thought we had asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13118)|
| 3:38:41| how much is a feasibility study actually going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13121)|
| 3:38:45| And to bring us more information, the information I'm asking for is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13125)|
| 3:38:48| is from the mayor's office, is to have a plan to actually pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13128)|
| 3:38:54| I think we have at least an estimate of what this ought to bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13134)|
| 3:38:57| whether it's $12, $15, $10, $20, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13137)|
| 3:39:02| Right now I don't see that we have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13142)|
| 3:39:04| But if the mayor and sheriff you can work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13144)|
| 3:39:07| if we can come up with a plan to pay for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13147)|
| 3:39:11| then I'm prepared to move forward on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13151)|
| 3:39:14| because I think it is a high priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13154)|
| 3:39:19| I think we have a ballpark range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13159)|
| 3:39:21| You're right, we can't have a definitive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13161)|
| 3:39:23| because we will not know what it costs without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13163)|
| 3:39:25| But here's what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| We'll go back and look at what's being generated out of the fee structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13167)|
| 3:39:30| that has been alluded to and see where that brings us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13170)|
| 3:39:32| We'll look at, sheriff, we'll work with you and look at your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13172)|
| 3:39:35| to see what number we could have in savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13175)|
| 3:39:38| Now, remember, when it comes to these fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13178)|
| 3:39:41| judges can waive those fees and quite often do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13181)|
| 3:39:44| So you're not getting that off of every case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13184)|
| 3:39:46| That's been one of our large concerns in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13186)|
| 3:39:49| So we're going to have to look at what is actually being generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13189)|
| 3:39:52| where some savings are and how we can accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13192)|
| 3:39:54| We'll also go back and look at the current bond market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13194)|
| 3:39:57| and see what it's going to cost us per million that we think we can borrow funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13197)|
| 3:40:00| So we will not have a definitive number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13200)|
| 3:40:03| but we can at least have a strategy that we can say this will work, this won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13203)|
| 3:40:08| That's why I've asked for a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13208)|
| 3:40:12| That'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13212)|
| 3:40:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13215)|
| 3:40:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13216)|
| 3:40:17| Mr. Vice Chairman, I want to clear up the litigation thing once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13217)|
| 3:40:21| What we passed was $25 for jailhouse security, $25 for school construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13221)|
| 3:40:31| And we passed it by ordinance as well as resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13231)|
| 3:40:34| So that's what's on the books unless we want to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13234)|
| 3:40:37| But a case may be made for courthouse security with the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13237)|
| 3:40:41| I think what the sheriff was referring to was there's that $50 litigation fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13241)|
| 3:40:45| which is brought by everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| Then there's also a $10 court cost that's added for jailhouse construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13247)|
| 3:40:52| or penal form construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13252)|
| 3:40:54| Has that already been passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13254)|
| 3:40:55| That's a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13255)|
| 3:40:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13256)|
| 3:40:57| Two separate acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to turn it back over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13259)|
| 3:41:03| 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13263)|
| 3:41:09| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13269)|
| 3:41:12| asking the Knox County Mayor's Office to extend the hiring freeze on all new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13272)|
| 3:41:16| positions through June 30, 2009, and requesting the fee offices to follow likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13276)|
| 3:41:22| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13282)|
| 3:41:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13283)|
| 3:41:24| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13284)|
| 3:41:25| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13285)|
| 3:41:27| Took no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13290)|
| 3:41:32| Commissioner Lupo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13292)|
| 3:41:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13293)|
| 3:41:34| Since I do work for the Knox County Trustee's Office, I'm going to recuse myself of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13294)|
| 3:41:39| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13299)|
| 3:41:40| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13300)|
| 3:41:42| I had a question about the wording on this because it says all new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13302)|
| 3:41:47| And I believe that the way, or at least the way I interpreted that during the Finance Committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13307)|
| 3:41:53| is it said that they would not add new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| And I would think that a hiring freeze actually means that if there's a vacant position, you don't fill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13316)|
| 3:42:04| And I would like some clarification on that because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13324)|
| 3:42:07| I don't think they're going to be hiring very many brand-new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13327)|
| 3:42:10| And I think that what we meant to say would be just a hiring freeze period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13330)|
| 3:42:14| And that's not what the resolution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13334)|
| 3:42:17| What we said there, Mr. Briggs, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13337)|
| 3:42:20| was they could replace anyone that retired or, you know, retired or quit or fired or something, make replacements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13340)|
| 3:42:29| But there would be no new positions created in anybody hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13349)|
| 3:42:32| I don't think you're going to save much money that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13352)|
| 3:42:35| Mr. Mayor, would you like to comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13355)|
| 3:42:37| I'd be delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13357)|
| 3:42:38| We have a hiring freeze in place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13358)|
| 3:42:40| We don't plan on filling positions unless what we would view them being mission critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13360)|
| 3:42:44| And let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13364)|
| 3:42:46| If we get short nurses at our health department, we're going to need to fill some positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13366)|
| 3:42:50| People's health is on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13370)|
| 3:42:52| We're not going to do that unless it becomes critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13372)|
| 3:42:55| We planned on opening a new Shumpert Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13375)|
| 3:42:58| We can keep it closed, but we've figured out some ways to rearrange positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13378)|
| 3:43:01| to put a couple of folks over there to make that work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13381)|
| 3:43:05| So we're not planning on filling any position unless it becomes a safety issue with our public's health and welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13385)|
| 3:43:13| or if it's something like Shumpert Park we'd already planned on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13393)|
| 3:43:16| and Mr. Patel has gone back, looked at his numbers, has made some reductions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13396)|
| 3:43:19| and then we're going to go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13399)|
| 3:43:21| But we have fewer employees now than any time we've had since 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13401)|
| 3:43:24| and I expect that number to drop, not climb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13404)|
| 3:43:28| And we want you to work with us in that framework, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13408)|
| 3:43:36| And the whole notion of that was to just send the message that we are in difficult times right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13416)|
| 3:43:40| And as I mentioned some of the figures earlier, we just don't know what the next 90 days are going to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13420)|
| 3:43:45| But we cannot force the fee offices to do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13425)|
| 3:43:48| but this is just a request that on filling any positions that they be prudent in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13428)|
| 3:43:53| and just take the financial condition of the county into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13433)|
| 3:43:57| I think in philosophy, the executive branch is supportive of what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13437)|
| 3:44:04| But, again, we do need the leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13444)|
| 3:44:06| If we run short in a critical area, we've got to fill it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13446)|
| 3:44:08| and we're certainly not going to be adding any what you would call new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13448)|
| 3:44:12| We're going backwards in terms of employees that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13452)|
| 3:44:17| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13457)|
| 3:44:18| Do we have a proposal on the motion on the table yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13458)|
| 3:44:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13462)|
| 3:44:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13463)|
| 3:44:24| The motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13464)|
| 3:44:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13465)|
| 3:44:26| I want to make a substitute motion that we go month to month on this and we redo it every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13466)|
| 3:44:32| I mean, again, I'm not saying that I support the policies that are about to be implemented on the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13472)|
| 3:44:40| but if there is grant money made available to hire folks, I want Knox County to get its fair share of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13480)|
| 3:44:48| And so I would like to make this month to month so that if in a couple of months it comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13488)|
| 3:44:57| that there are some federal grant dollars available to, say, hire nurses at the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13497)|
| 3:45:02| that we haven't tied our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13502)|
| 3:45:05| So I propose that we pass this, but we do it for 30 days, not 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13505)|
| 3:45:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13513)|
| 3:45:17| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13517)|
| 3:45:20| He seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13520)|
| 3:45:22| Well, he caught me midstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13522)|
| 3:45:26| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13526)|
| 3:45:27| Yes, I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13527)|
| 3:45:28| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13528)|
| 3:45:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13530)|
| 3:45:33| I wanted clarity also, just like Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13533)|
| 3:45:36| and that was my understanding that we would not fill new positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13536)|
| 3:45:41| and we would not fill vacant positions unless it was either an emergency or a dire need on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13541)|
| 3:45:47| In regards to the amendment, I personally don't think that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13547)|
| 3:45:52| I think, obviously, if circumstances change, we would revisit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13552)|
| 3:45:56| But I would like to see us plan for the remainder of the year, fiscal year, not to fill vacant positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13556)|
| 3:46:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13564)|
| 3:46:07| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13567)|
| 3:46:08| Mr. Law Director, if we pass this, will it inhibit or prohibit, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13568)|
| 3:46:14| anybody hiring anybody that's mission critical, this ordinance, the way it's worded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13574)|
| 3:46:25| There's no exception in here for executive office vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13585)|
| 3:46:35| Of course, by its very terms, and I think it's understood that it does not apply to the fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13595)|
| 3:46:40| but for any office that falls under the executive branch of Knox County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13600)|
| 3:46:46| there's not a specific exception here that I see that would apply to mission critical positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13606)|
| 3:46:59| It could easily be added if that's the sense of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13619)|
| 3:47:02| One thing I hope you keep in mind with the way it's written right now, we don't open Schumpeter Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13622)|
| 3:47:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13627)|
| 3:47:12| So, if we came and added language, no new positions unless they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13632)|
| 3:47:17| Well, I think that what we're doing is too blanketed over the whole, if we needed to hire somebody, we need to hire somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13637)|
| 3:47:26| And I think we'd be in violation of this resolution if we did try to hire somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13646)|
| 3:47:32| So I think that I would prefer the resolution to read that we would ask all county departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13652)|
| 3:47:39| and fee offices to realize the financial situation we're in and not hire somebody unless it's mission critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13659)|
| 3:47:52| But there's a substitute amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13672)|
| 3:47:55| I'm not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13675)|
| 3:47:56| We've got to make this budget work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13676)|
| 3:47:57| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13677)|
| 3:47:58| But there's a substitute motion, so I can't make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13678)|
| 3:48:00| I just want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13680)|
| 3:48:02| And can I accept it as a friendly amendment to mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13682)|
| 3:48:04| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13684)|
| 3:48:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13685)|
| 3:48:06| We both accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13686)|
| 3:48:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13687)|
| 3:48:08| What are you all accepting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13688)|
| 3:48:10| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13690)|
| 3:48:11| You had a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13691)|
| 3:48:14| Mine is just to simply change it 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13694)|
| 3:48:17| But it was a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13697)|
| 3:48:19| It had nothing to do with commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13699)|
| 3:48:21| You've got to withdraw that lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13701)|
| 3:48:24| I'd like the friendly amendment to the motion to be that it goes to the end of the budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13704)|
| 3:48:29| but it also gives leeway for mission critical positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13709)|
| 3:48:33| So are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13713)|
| 3:48:35| I'm accepting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13715)|
| 3:48:36| And Mr. Hammond accepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13716)|
| 3:48:38| So his amendment is to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13718)|
| 3:48:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13720)|
| 3:48:41| I guess I've got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13721)|
| 3:48:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13722)|
| 3:48:43| What's the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13723)|
| 3:48:44| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13724)|
| 3:48:45| His motion is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13725)|
| 3:48:46| Yours was a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13726)|
| 3:48:47| I'm in favor of the whole year for the full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13727)|
| 3:48:48| But you want to withdraw your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13728)|
| 3:48:51| Procedurally, the best way is for simply lumpy to withdraw his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13731)|
| 3:48:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13735)|
| 3:48:57| And then we can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13737)|
| 3:49:00| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13740)|
| 3:49:01| Then my motion is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13741)|
| 3:49:03| Well, that's what happens when you withdraw one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| A motion, not an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13745)|
| 3:49:06| You can second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13746)|
| 3:49:07| He can name it after you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13747)|
| 3:49:08| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13748)|
| 3:49:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13749)|
| 3:49:10| I'm not withdrawing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13750)|
| 3:49:11| I don't think we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13751)|
| 3:49:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13752)|
| 3:49:13| We're not going to withdraw it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13755)|
| 3:49:18| I think what we're doing here is good on its face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13758)|
| 3:49:22| I think we're trying to do the right thing and send the right message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13762)|
| 3:49:25| I think we're all on the same page about making sure we have a balanced budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13765)|
| 3:49:29| that we're interested in the community and our government working efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13769)|
| 3:49:34| I think that our current executive branch has demonstrated that they're on the same page that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13774)|
| 3:49:42| I think we're looking anywhere between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13782)|
| 3:49:44| I haven't got the numbers down, Pat, but I look at my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13784)|
| 3:49:48| and I know that we have lost jobs in the mining industry out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13788)|
| 3:49:53| We've lost jobs out of the Forks of the River Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13793)|
| 3:49:56| We're going to feel some rippling effect for real, not counting just the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13796)|
| 3:50:00| I'm talking about in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13800)|
| 3:50:02| And I think that both the finance department, I think the mayor and everybody here has that same concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13802)|
| 3:50:10| But to limit ourselves to where we cannot react effectively to the needs when they come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13810)|
| 3:50:16| I don't think that's wise on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13816)|
| 3:50:20| I do think that we could stress the importance of our current budget situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13820)|
| 3:50:28| I think our mayor understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13828)|
| 3:50:30| So to totally tie our administration's hands on who they can hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13830)|
| 3:50:35| and who they can't hire is going a little strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13835)|
| 3:50:38| That's just my opinion on it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13838)|
| 3:50:41| I think we have a good administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13841)|
| 3:50:43| I think they're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13843)|
| 3:50:45| I think we're all doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13845)|
| 3:50:47| I think we're all on the same page with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13847)|
| 3:50:50| And I'd like us to consider that in this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13850)|
| 3:50:54| I think Commissioner Hammond and I are both on the same page philosophically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13854)|
| 3:50:59| It's just a matter of how we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13859)|
| 3:51:04| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13864)|
| 3:51:10| Your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13870)|
| 3:51:15| Do we have an agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13875)|
| 3:51:18| Those are the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13878)|
| 3:51:19| This is more or less just a request of the department's heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13879)|
| 3:51:22| and the fee officers to watch their spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13882)|
| 3:51:25| In my opinion, the administration is already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13885)|
| 3:51:29| And the mayor has already said he was going to extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13889)|
| 3:51:32| So why do we even have to debate it, in my opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13892)|
| 3:51:36| I believe it was because we have no control over the fee officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13896)|
| 3:51:39| Commissioner Hammond just wanted us to send a letter to them asking them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13899)|
| 3:51:42| Well, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13902)|
| 3:51:44| We have no control over the fee officers anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13904)|
| 3:51:47| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13907)|
| 3:51:48| But he wanted us to send a letter to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13908)|
| 3:51:50| We could have just said, let's send a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13910)|
| 3:51:52| This would have been 30 minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13912)|
| 3:51:57| No, I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13917)|
| 3:51:59| If that will accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13919)|
| 3:52:00| I just feel like that as the Board of Directors that we need to go on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13920)|
| 3:52:04| as saying that for the next six months we want all these folks to watch their hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13924)|
| 3:52:09| given our economic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13929)|
| 3:52:11| I just feel like we need to do that and go on record with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13931)|
| 3:52:14| So if we want to go on record as sending a letter, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13934)|
| 3:52:17| I just think that we need to do something formal as the Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13937)|
| 3:52:21| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13941)|
| 3:52:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13943)|
| 3:52:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13945)|
| 3:52:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13946)|
| 3:52:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13947)|
| 3:52:28| The chair says that the aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13948)|
| 3:52:31| Who are the two ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13951)|
| 3:52:37| I remember Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13957)|
| 3:52:40| You had to recuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13960)|
| 3:52:41| I recused him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13961)|
| 3:52:42| No one recused him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13962)|
| 3:52:45| Now we're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13965)|
| 3:52:49| The original motion with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13969)|
| 3:52:52| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13972)|
| 3:52:53| Your amendment was Brad too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13973)|
| 3:52:54| His amendment went on with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| I just think that we just need to send, like the Chairman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13976)|
| 3:52:59| we just need to send a letter requesting the officers to be belt tightening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13979)|
| 3:53:04| as the rest of the county is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13984)|
| 3:53:07| Do you offer that as a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13989)|
| 3:53:10| An amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13990)|
| 3:53:11| An amendment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13991)|
| 3:53:12| And I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13992)|
| 3:53:14| Nothing to do with our new positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13994)|
| 3:53:17| No, we just sent a letter asking the administrative branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13997)|
| 3:53:19| and all the fee offices to be cognizant of our financial situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=13999)|
| 3:53:22| and be careful with any additional spending and new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14002)|
| 3:53:26| Everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14006)|
| 3:53:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14007)|
| 3:53:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14009)|
| 3:53:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14010)|
| 3:53:31| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14011)|
| 3:53:34| And we'll recuse them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14014)|
| 3:53:40| We need to go back to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14020)|
| 3:53:44| Did you find that information on 120 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14024)|
| 3:53:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14029)|
| 3:53:51| The statute actually I think was proposed by the Knox County delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14031)|
| 3:54:02| TCA 5104B1 requires that appointments for vacancies be made within 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14042)|
| 3:54:15| and the final decision in the ouster suit was on October 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14055)|
| 3:54:23| So the 120 days would end on February 12th, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14063)|
| 3:54:36| So, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14076)|
| 3:54:37| is it your opinion that we need to go ahead and fill this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14077)|
| 3:54:41| I would recommend that the commission act to fill the vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14081)|
| 3:54:45| before the expiration of 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14085)|
| 3:54:53| February 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14093)|
| 3:54:56| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to throw this out for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14096)|
| 3:54:58| that we accept resumes from those who would be interested in an appointment by December 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14098)|
| 3:55:03| that they've been forwarded to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14103)|
| 3:55:04| and that we look at the week of January 12th or January 19th to do our public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14104)|
| 3:55:09| and that we formally vote on it January 26th at our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14109)|
| 3:55:16| In the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14116)|
| 3:55:18| I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14118)|
| 3:55:21| Would it be okay, would it be 14 days beyond the 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14121)|
| 3:55:27| We wait until the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14127)|
| 3:55:29| No, that's January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14129)|
| 3:55:30| January 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14130)|
| 3:55:33| Mr. Law Director, I believe Mr. Pinkston or someone over here had a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14133)|
| 3:55:38| to not appoint anybody prior to tabling it procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14138)|
| 3:55:46| Does this need to be in the form of a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14146)|
| 3:55:50| I'll make that in the form of a substitute motion, if that would be procedurally correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14150)|
| 3:55:54| Before all of this was just discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14154)|
| 3:55:57| Well, it started out as a discussion, but prior to going, there was a motion to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14157)|
| 3:56:02| Wait until it went through the appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14162)|
| 3:56:04| Until it went through the appeal process, and then we tabled that until we have to actually have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14164)|
| 3:56:13| to bring it off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14173)|
| 3:56:15| I'll make a motion we take it off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14175)|
| 3:56:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14177)|
| 3:56:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14178)|
| 3:56:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14179)|
| 3:56:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14180)|
| 3:56:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14181)|
| 3:56:22| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14182)|
| 3:56:24| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14184)|
| 3:56:27| I'd then like to make a substitute motion that we accept resumes through December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14187)|
| 3:56:31| I think Mr. Smith wants to have hearings in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14191)|
| 3:56:33| Set up those hearings sometime in the week of the 12th or the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14193)|
| 3:56:37| but that we set a formal date for voting on January 26th at our regular January meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14197)|
| 3:56:42| which will be before the February 12th deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14202)|
| 3:56:45| The 19th, I think, is a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14205)|
| 3:56:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14209)|
| 3:56:50| I was talking about that week, sometime the week of the 12th or the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14210)|
| 3:56:52| I just want to let Commissioner Smith know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14212)|
| 3:56:59| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14219)|
| 3:57:05| I'm just saying one, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14225)|
| 3:57:06| One out in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14226)|
| 3:57:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14228)|
| 3:57:11| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14231)|
| 3:57:16| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14236)|
| 3:57:18| Has any other commissioners up here been sued yet for perjury?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14238)|
| 3:57:24| I keep hearing rumors that someone may be, and I'm just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14244)|
| 3:57:27| has anything been filed on any of us yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14247)|
| 3:57:32| What's that have to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14252)|
| 3:57:33| Yes, your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14253)|
| 3:57:34| Well, what I was curious about is if we're going to go ahead and have public forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14254)|
| 3:57:37| if another of us may be brought up on a similar offense, not me, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14257)|
| 3:57:43| But if another of us is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14263)|
| 3:57:45| if this rumor about one of us being brought up on a similar offense through a lawsuit is brought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14265)|
| 3:57:52| I'm wondering if maybe we might ought to go ahead and have a backup in case that person, you know, is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14272)|
| 3:58:00| I mean, since the Knox County Commission has become one massive game of political musical chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14280)|
| 3:58:06| I'm wondering if we might ought to have a backup in place in case another of us is removed for a similar offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14286)|
| 3:58:13| I mean, this is on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14293)|
| 3:58:16| He is not guilty until the appeal is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14296)|
| 3:58:21| And I believe that this appeal is going to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| And I think that it's very obvious that the folks that are pushing for this are folks that didn't get along very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14303)|
| 3:58:31| with Commissioner Moore when he served on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14311)|
| 3:58:34| And I think it's petty that folks are bringing this stuff up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14314)|
| 3:58:38| The man deserves his day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14318)|
| 3:58:40| And I believe that it's very petty that now his political enemies are using their authority to try to replace the man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14320)|
| 3:58:47| before he's had an opportunity for due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14327)|
| 3:58:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14332)|
| 3:58:54| What's the feel of this body as far as the interviews that you're wanting to have the week of the 12th and the 19th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14334)|
| 3:59:01| Are you wanting to do the interviews there and that be it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14341)|
| 3:59:05| Or do we want to have another interview here on the date that you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14345)|
| 3:59:11| What do you all want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14351)|
| 3:59:12| I mean, I'm flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14352)|
| 3:59:14| I'm deferring to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14354)|
| 3:59:16| This is your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14356)|
| 3:59:17| And you just, you know, mentioned in discussions earlier that you felt it should be in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14357)|
| 3:59:23| It needs to be televised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14363)|
| 3:59:25| So, wherever, I don't know if Central High School has a TV mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14365)|
| 3:59:28| or if the TV stations could come and go live from wherever they probably could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14368)|
| 3:59:33| But it would just need to be televised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14373)|
| 3:59:35| I don't know if we have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14375)|
| 3:59:36| I was thinking just of the Hall Senior Citizens Building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14376)|
| 3:59:39| I don't know if somebody here could tell us if that's hooked up or not or could be hooked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14379)|
| 3:59:44| I don't know if it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14384)|
| 3:59:47| But I think, you know, you may have, say we picked the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14387)|
| 3:59:50| And you've got, you know, I've got a list of 13 people that have been looking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14390)|
| 3:59:55| And one of those persons happens to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14395)|
| 3:59:57| I think we need to give another interview, say the day of, if people want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14397)|
| 4:00:03| because they can't make it where it may be that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14403)|
| 4:00:06| It turns out to be a snow day, too, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14406)|
| 4:00:08| You don't know what the weather is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14408)|
| 4:00:10| But I'm going to check to see what the facilities are available during that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14410)|
| 4:00:14| And then I'll get with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14414)|
| 4:00:15| I'll get with Jolie, and then we'll put out letters to the time and place where it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14415)|
| 4:00:19| and put in newspaper individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14419)|
| 4:00:23| So what's your all's feel as far as you all think we need to interview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14423)|
| 4:00:29| Commissioner Smith, I think I'd like to see something in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14429)|
| 4:00:36| But then the day of that we're actually going to vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14436)|
| 4:00:40| we can give everybody another opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14440)|
| 4:00:43| I think that would be the prudent thing to do regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14443)|
| 4:00:48| And that way you get a chance to possibly hear from them twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14448)|
| 4:00:54| or if someone couldn't make it, they could have a chance then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14454)|
| 4:00:58| But go ahead and have something set up in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14458)|
| 4:01:02| If it's that important to them, this far out in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14462)|
| 4:01:08| I would think they would try to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14468)|
| 4:01:12| Obviously, if someone becomes ill, that's a little out of their control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14472)|
| 4:01:16| But I think to give them at least some time the day of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14476)|
| 4:01:21| Well, let me try to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14481)|
| 4:01:22| And let me try to get like a Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14482)|
| 4:01:24| We'll try to do a Tuesday night and then have a Thursday night available also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14484)|
| 4:01:27| So if Tuesday night happens to be snowed out, we'll just go to the Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14487)|
| 4:01:31| And then we'll come here the day that Mr. Hammond was saying and have the wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14491)|
| 4:01:37| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14499)|
| 4:01:40| I want to say one thing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14500)|
| 4:01:42| We may be getting ourselves in a lot of trouble here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14502)|
| 4:01:45| I thank Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14505)|
| 4:01:47| I think Commissioner Moore will probably win this appeal because I sit through both court cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14507)|
| 4:01:53| And there was a commissioner, in my opinion, committed perjury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14513)|
| 4:01:56| that may have had something to do with his conviction on this ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14516)|
| 4:02:01| So we really need to be careful on this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14521)|
| 4:02:05| because I think that he will win the appeal because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14525)|
| 4:02:10| But the fact still remains we're still only nominating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14530)|
| 4:02:16| or selecting a caretaker for this position, an interim position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14536)|
| 4:02:21| It's not to be forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14541)|
| 4:02:23| It's an interim position for and if and when Commissioner Moore does come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14543)|
| 4:02:29| If he doesn't come back, then it's good to the end of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14549)|
| 4:02:32| But it's a caretaker position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14552)|
| 4:02:34| It's an interim position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14554)|
| 4:02:35| I believe the law director said, didn't you say it would have to go through until 2010 for the rest of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14555)|
| 4:02:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14560)|
| 4:02:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14561)|
| 4:02:42| What I said was if Mr. Moore is successful, let's start from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14562)|
| 4:02:49| If this body decides to appoint someone to serve in Mr. Moore's position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14569)|
| 4:03:00| if that vacancy and Mr. Moore is successful on appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14580)|
| 4:03:06| then the appointee is out and Mr. Moore is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14586)|
| 4:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14592)|
| 4:03:13| Suppose he loses, then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14593)|
| 4:03:15| Then the appointee will serve the full unexpired term until 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14595)|
| 4:03:22| And it sounds like we don't have a choice on whether or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14602)|
| 4:03:26| It sounds like we have 120 days to make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14606)|
| 4:03:29| But under the newly enacted statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14609)|
| 4:03:33| this body is required by state law to act within 120 days to fill the vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14613)|
| 4:03:42| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14622)|
| 4:03:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14626)|
| 4:03:48| I guess I just had a general, I guess, question or request and maybe a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14628)|
| 4:03:54| And that is that it sounds like this appeal may be complete by the 12th of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14634)|
| 4:04:02| So is there a way that we could send a letter letting the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14642)|
| 4:04:08| whoever is hearing this case, know of our timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14648)|
| 4:04:12| Just state it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14652)|
| 4:04:14| We, by state statute, have a 120-day window to fill this position, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14654)|
| 4:04:21| That date ends on February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14661)|
| 4:04:23| If at all possible, is it, could you render a decision by then to not further complicate the matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14663)|
| 4:04:31| Or is that out of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14671)|
| 4:04:35| I wouldn't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14675)|
| 4:04:42| And from a practical standpoint, Commissioner, the case will be argued in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14682)|
| 4:04:52| But as far as the court then rendering a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14692)|
| 4:04:59| typically it takes a little while for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14699)|
| 4:05:03| Now, I do believe that this case will be expedited because there's a state statute that addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14703)|
| 4:05:11| But still, it doesn't provide a definite timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14711)|
| 4:05:15| So even if it's argued in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14715)|
| 4:05:18| it wouldn't at all be unusual for it to take another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14718)|
| 4:05:23| if it were the typical case, it would probably take a minimum of six to eight weeks before you could get a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14723)|
| 4:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14733)|
| 4:05:34| You know, I guess I would just hate for a person to go through, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14734)|
| 4:05:39| and I went through it as did Commissioner Wright and Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14739)|
| 4:05:43| a fairly exhaustive process, you know, being vetted by this body once or twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14743)|
| 4:05:52| and serving, you know, a two or three week term potentially, a two or three week or maybe a month term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14752)|
| 4:05:59| So I would just hate to take our concerned citizens who are going to step up to this process through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14759)|
| 4:06:06| and then not be more lasting than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14766)|
| 4:06:09| But I definitely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14769)|
| 4:06:10| I guess, Commissioner McKenzie, that's something they'll have to consider as they decide to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14770)|
| 4:06:17| Good practice for the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14777)|
| 4:06:22| Answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14782)|
| 4:06:23| You know, one thing we need not to do is take a commission picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14783)|
| 4:06:32| Yeah, I think that's bad luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14792)|
| 4:06:33| We've taken ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14793)|
| 4:06:37| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14797)|
| 4:06:38| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14798)|
| 4:06:40| The motion is to Commissioner Hammond, if you'd like to restate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14800)|
| 4:06:44| that we accept resumes from those who are interested in the position through December 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14804)|
| 4:06:47| that they be forwarded to the commissioners and also be posted on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14807)|
| 4:06:51| and forwarded to the members of the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14811)|
| 4:06:53| Commissioner Smith will work on public hearings and set dates for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14813)|
| 4:06:57| But January 26th is the date that we will actually vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14817)|
| 4:07:01| That's our regular commission meeting that we will vote that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14821)|
| 4:07:05| Do you think that would be the last thing of our commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14825)|
| 4:07:09| That would have to be the last thing, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14829)|
| 4:07:11| Or January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14831)|
| 4:07:12| Probably the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14832)|
| 4:07:13| Do it off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14833)|
| 4:07:15| That way you can have someone there with you during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14835)|
| 4:07:21| So you want to interview and you want to swear him in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14841)|
| 4:07:23| Run out and get a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14843)|
| 4:07:25| We'll figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14845)|
| 4:07:27| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14847)|
| 4:07:28| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14848)|
| 4:07:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14849)|
| 4:07:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14850)|
| 4:07:32| Motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14852)|
| 4:07:40| I think we are on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14860)|
| 4:07:43| Steve Carroll, animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14863)|
| 4:07:52| Steve, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14872)|
| 4:07:59| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14879)|
| 4:08:01| Steve Carroll, 5816 Atkins Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14881)|
| 4:08:07| There is a people who live in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14887)|
| 4:08:10| They have several dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14890)|
| 4:08:11| And I love dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14891)|
| 4:08:12| I own three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14892)|
| 4:08:14| But these dogs bark all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14894)|
| 4:08:17| Every dog has its seasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14897)|
| 4:08:19| And when these dogs come in seasons, they need to be put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14899)|
| 4:08:23| Or even put in a breeding pen to be done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14903)|
| 4:08:28| These dogs, this particular dog I'm talking about, she runs loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14908)|
| 4:08:33| I don't know how many litter of pups she's had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14913)|
| 4:08:38| She's a pest to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14918)|
| 4:08:41| And the next-door neighbor put his trash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14921)|
| 4:08:45| This dog, when she's got pups, she tires this trash up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14925)|
| 4:08:48| She's looking for stuff to feed her pups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14928)|
| 4:08:53| Other dogs come into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14933)|
| 4:08:56| The dogs, they start a real ruckus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14936)|
| 4:09:04| I've not got anything I want done about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14944)|
| 4:09:07| Like I said, I like dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14947)|
| 4:09:09| But I think we need to have something done about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14949)|
| 4:09:12| This has went on for several, several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14952)|
| 4:09:15| And I cannot talk to this young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14955)|
| 4:09:20| And I can't talk to his mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14960)|
| 4:09:23| Actually, they think it's kind of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14963)|
| 4:09:25| But it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14965)|
| 4:09:26| It's a serious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14966)|
| 4:09:28| That's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14968)|
| 4:09:30| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14970)|
| 4:09:35| Could I ask you a question, Mr. Carroll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14975)|
| 4:09:38| You sure can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14978)|
| 4:09:40| How many times has animal control been out there to investigate this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14980)|
| 4:09:46| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14986)|
| 4:09:47| Yes, sir, several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14987)|
| 4:09:48| They've been out there, I think, once or twice last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14988)|
| 4:09:51| But they've not done nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14991)|
| 4:09:56| I'm 68 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14996)|
| 4:09:58| I've retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=14998)|
| 4:10:00| I'd like to enjoy a little bit of my retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15000)|
| 4:10:03| Four o'clock in the morning, it ain't nothing for any of these dogs to start raising canes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15003)|
| 4:10:08| Once or twice a week, sometimes three times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15008)|
| 4:10:13| I'd like for Grant, if he would come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15013)|
| 4:10:15| Grant, I'm not sure it's your field, but if you'll help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15015)|
| 4:10:18| I've had several calls on people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15018)|
| 4:10:20| And I think it's time that we take the ordinance out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15020)|
| 4:10:23| What is our ordinance, and how many dogs can a person have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15023)|
| 4:10:27| I don't have the ordinance in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15027)|
| 4:10:29| There's a certain number allowed per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15029)|
| 4:10:31| Four dogs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15031)|
| 4:10:33| It sounds about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15033)|
| 4:10:34| It might be five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15034)|
| 4:10:35| I'd have to look at the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15035)|
| 4:10:36| I think if you've got over four, it's considered a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15036)|
| 4:10:39| Does that have to have a license to run it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15039)|
| 4:10:41| If you'll check on that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15041)|
| 4:10:43| I can certainly look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15043)|
| 4:10:44| And I think animal control has been out there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15044)|
| 4:10:47| But as Mr. Carroll mentioned, if the dogs are barking at four in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15047)|
| 4:10:51| we don't have our animal control officers on call for those issues at that time of the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15051)|
| 4:10:57| Usually they'll go out, you know, during working hours, leave a door hanger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15057)|
| 4:11:01| or try to get in touch with the property owner, talk about barking collars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15061)|
| 4:11:04| We have a barking collar program in our animal control department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15064)|
| 4:11:06| But I'll certainly get with the Carrolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15066)|
| 4:11:09| and get with our animal control director and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15069)|
| 4:11:12| See if we can send someone out there at four in the morning and pay them overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15072)|
| 4:11:15| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15075)|
| 4:11:20| Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15080)|
| 4:11:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15082)|
| 4:11:24| I'm going to let him go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15084)|
| 4:11:25| And we have one more issue after Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15085)|
| 4:11:30| A report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15090)|
| 4:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15092)|
| 4:11:33| My name is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15093)|
| 4:11:34| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15094)|
| 4:11:40| I wanted to clear up one misconception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15100)|
| 4:11:42| I was watching the video of the recent decision on the natural resources mediation agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15102)|
| 4:11:50| Commissioner McKenzie, you were told that it's perfectly normal for mulch to be sold to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15110)|
| 4:11:56| with fecal coliform counts of a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15116)|
| 4:12:00| The state of Tennessee says you can go to jail for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15120)|
| 4:12:05| But it's a very serious problem when you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15125)|
| 4:12:08| Now, the other misconception is this commission was told several times during that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15128)|
| 4:12:14| that if you approve a mediated settlement agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15134)|
| 4:12:16| that it will in no way affect the false claims lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15136)|
| 4:12:22| But when we got to court, one of the strongest arguments made by Dean Farmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15142)|
| 4:12:28| was that you all had accepted a mediated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15148)|
| 4:12:30| The claims were settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15150)|
| 4:12:33| There seemed to be some discrepancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15153)|
| 4:12:36| Now, I want to pose to you all another question, like I did last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15156)|
| 4:12:42| What sense does it make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15162)|
| 4:12:45| First, let me inform you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15165)|
| 4:12:46| Dean Farmer identified the engineering and public works department as his client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15166)|
| 4:12:52| So, my question is, what sense does it make to allow the very same department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15172)|
| 4:12:59| that never noticed all this money going unpaid for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15179)|
| 4:13:04| the very same department that now admittedly knew the money was not paid in September of 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15184)|
| 4:13:11| when they stood at this podium and told you this contractor was in complete compliance with their contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15191)|
| 4:13:17| the very same department that was identified by a codes enforcement officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15197)|
| 4:13:21| as being the department that had been calling codes enforcement on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15201)|
| 4:13:25| the very same department that when I identified Shamrock Organic Products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15205)|
| 4:13:30| as also knowing this money was going unpaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15210)|
| 4:13:33| the very same department that withheld their air quality permit, almost shutting them down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15213)|
| 4:13:39| the very same department that when I informed them that the mulch company was aware this money was also not being paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15219)|
| 4:13:45| that sued the mulch company and tried to shut them down two days after my meeting with Dean Farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15225)|
| 4:13:52| The very same department that didn't collect this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15232)|
| 4:13:56| authored a letter to county commission stating that there was absolutely no evidence of fraud whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15236)|
| 4:14:03| before we ever took depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15243)|
| 4:14:06| The very same department that authored this missive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15246)|
| 4:14:10| and now admits they authored it before an investigation took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15250)|
| 4:14:14| this very same department that has done these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15254)|
| 4:14:19| they decided there was no evidence of fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15259)|
| 4:14:23| The very same department that failed to turn over some of this evidence of fraud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15263)|
| 4:14:27| until after we went to court despite multiple open records requests and legal discovery processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15267)|
| 4:14:34| What sense does it make to let the department who didn't collect the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15274)|
| 4:14:38| decide there's no fraud and this needs to be dismissed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15278)|
| 4:14:42| The court asked a very interesting question when we were in the last day of litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15282)|
| 4:14:50| They asked, is it legal for your engineering and public works department through Dean Farmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15290)|
| 4:14:58| to declare prosecuting authority, intervene in my lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15298)|
| 4:15:03| and take over for the sole purpose of dismissing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15303)|
| 4:15:08| Is it legal for the very person who's supposed to be being investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15308)|
| 4:15:13| to use their attorney to see to it that the case is dismissed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15313)|
| 4:15:17| The judge on his own felt the need to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15317)|
| 4:15:22| I think that speaks volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15322)|
| 4:15:26| And the more interesting part was how vigorously Knox County's representative, Mr. Farmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15326)|
| 4:15:32| argued that he had the perfect legal right to intervene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15332)|
| 4:15:38| for the sole purpose of seeing to it that this case was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15338)|
| 4:15:44| I was sitting in the courtroom when the argument was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15344)|
| 4:15:48| Folks, what kind of sense does this make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15348)|
| 4:15:51| Does this start a pattern that explains why we have some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15351)|
| 4:15:55| that have arose in Knox County over the past few years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15355)|
| 4:15:59| Brad, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15359)|
| 4:16:01| Thank you, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15361)|
| 4:16:03| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15363)|
| 4:16:05| This makes no sense to me as a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15365)|
| 4:16:08| A lot of people think I'm a troublemaker, but I'd like to point out one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15368)|
| 4:16:13| Directly because of my efforts, and in my expenses approaching $20,000 at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15373)|
| 4:16:19| this county is going to collect over $200,000 in revenue sharing from this contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15379)|
| 4:16:24| at a minimum over the next three years that you otherwise would have never seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15384)|
| 4:16:30| Directly because of my efforts, you are no longer paying invoices to this contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15390)|
| 4:16:36| for work they had already been paid to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15396)|
| 4:16:39| And because of my efforts, no longer are you paying other contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15399)|
| 4:16:43| to come up here and perform work without any bid process or procurement code followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15403)|
| 4:16:49| At one point, there was a contractor who performed work at this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15409)|
| 4:16:53| who was not a regular vendor of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15413)|
| 4:16:56| and we actually paid natural resources so they could go ahead and pay them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15416)|
| 4:17:00| because natural resources was a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15420)|
| 4:17:02| This makes absolutely no sense to allow the same department head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15422)|
| 4:17:07| who this went on under their watch for five years to be in charge of making sure this case is dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15427)|
| 4:17:12| and this is not thoroughly investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15432)|
| 4:17:14| There has never been an audit on this since day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15434)|
| 4:17:18| And it's the same department that withheld the evidence that we desperately needed the last time we went to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15438)|
| 4:17:23| It was not turned over until later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15443)|
| 4:17:26| Thank you for your time, and you all have a happy holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15446)|
| 4:17:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15449)|
| 4:17:31| I have one more thing on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15451)|
| 4:17:34| The report from tax management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15454)|
| 4:17:37| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15457)|
| 4:17:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15458)|
| 4:17:39| Could I just ask Mr. Salter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15459)|
| 4:17:42| I'll ask a request of Mr. Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15462)|
| 4:17:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15464)|
| 4:17:47| Mr. Salter, if you know, and I'm not familiar with the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15467)|
| 4:17:56| I can't quote the number, but I did ask the question regarding fecal coliform and the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15476)|
| 4:18:06| and what's permissible and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15486)|
| 4:18:08| Could you do me a favor and just kind of pull the numbers on what the rates, if there's a threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15488)|
| 4:18:15| what that threshold is and forward that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15495)|
| 4:18:19| In terms of material that we sell to the public, once it goes out the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15499)|
| 4:18:25| if there is a number, if there is a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15505)|
| 4:18:28| There is a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15508)|
| 4:18:29| The threshold is 1,000 parts per million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15509)|
| 4:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15512)|
| 4:18:34| And the question, and I guess I'm not one to get in a long debate on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15514)|
| 4:18:38| but I guess maybe what I'll end up having to do is pull the transcript| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15518)|
| 4:18:44| and see what number I had asked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15524)|
| 4:18:49| But to alleviate that, could you give me, have we sold, and you don't have to answer it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15529)|
| 4:18:54| have we sold much or been tested, have we received tests that are greater than that 1,000 number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15534)|
| 4:19:03| for material going out the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15543)|
| 4:19:05| And if so, how many times, how many occasions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15545)|
| 4:19:08| We had probably on two occasions that I know of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15548)|
| 4:19:13| had material that exceeded that in the sales bins and it was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15553)|
| 4:19:18| And we did work with TDEC on that, and that material was later reprocessed and retested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15558)|
| 4:19:24| But the response by the county and the contractor was the appropriate response under the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15564)|
| 4:19:31| If you have an elevated test result for material, you just withdraw it and then reprocess it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15571)|
| 4:19:40| I need a report from the tax management associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15580)|
| 4:19:51| Dale Baker, 2938 Melbourne Terrace, Mount Juliet, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15591)|
| 4:19:57| I wanted to go over today the review of the tangible business personal property of the Knoxville New Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15597)|
| 4:20:04| as a result of reviewing their lease agreement with the Industrial Development Board has been finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15604)|
| 4:20:10| And through the assessor's office, we'll be sending a letter of finding to the Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15610)|
| 4:20:16| basically with three different sets of worksheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15616)|
| 4:20:19| One set of worksheets will be for the equipment that is owned by the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15619)|
| 4:20:26| through the original agreement and through the original bill of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15626)|
| 4:20:29| The second set of worksheets will be for the equipment that was purchased from 2003 to the end of 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15629)|
| 4:20:38| that did not have a bill of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15638)|
| 4:20:40| That equipment will generate a tax bill to the Sentinel, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15640)|
| 4:20:45| based for the three years will be $81,423.32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15645)|
| 4:20:52| Once the Sentinel pays that, they will be, based on the language in the lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15652)|
| 4:20:58| they will be able to ask for a credit back against their in lieu of payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15658)|
| 4:21:02| because that equipment could have been sold or could be sold to be a part of the Industrial Development Board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15662)|
| 4:21:08| owned equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15668)|
| 4:21:10| We will send a third worksheet, which is for raw materials, construction in progress, and leased equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15670)|
| 4:21:18| That worksheet will generate a tax bill, I believe, of $72,034.49, which will be due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15678)|
| 4:21:27| And they will not be allowed to, based on legal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15687)|
| 4:21:31| I believe they're not allowed to ask for a credit against the in lieu of for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15691)|
| 4:21:34| So, as a result of the review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15694)|
| 4:21:36| it looks like there will be an additional tax bill sent for the three years totaling $72,034.49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15696)|
| 4:21:48| What was that final figure again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15708)|
| 4:21:51| $72,034.49 is what I believe will be in new taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15711)|
| 4:22:00| And will their pilot go up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15720)|
| 4:22:04| No, the pilot will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15724)|
| 4:22:05| The pilot, they have it in lieu of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15725)|
| 4:22:07| Each year it does go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15727)|
| 4:22:08| Now, I believe the first five years stayed the same and it goes up since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15728)|
| 4:22:13| One of the things that will happen, going forward now, they will file two returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15733)|
| 4:22:18| They will file a return that identifies the equipment that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15738)|
| 4:22:22| that the Industrial Development Board owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15742)|
| 4:22:24| Each year they will, like for the current purchases this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15744)|
| 4:22:28| they will do a bill of sales selling that over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15748)|
| 4:22:31| Then they will also file a return, again, with leased equipment, construction in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15751)|
| 4:22:36| and raw materials, which will generate taxes above the in lieu of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15756)|
| 4:22:42| And that will be going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15762)|
| 4:22:45| Are there any fines as defined in the contract when they have the pilot that may become due?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15765)|
| 4:22:51| I think based on legal, as they look through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15771)|
| 4:22:54| there is no penalty or interest or fines associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15774)|
| 4:22:57| It is just that this is a back taxes due for these three years under review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15777)|
| 4:23:05| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15785)|
| 4:23:07| How much back taxes did you say we were due?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15787)|
| 4:23:09| I believe it's $72,034.49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15789)|
| 4:23:12| That was the numbers I worked with the Assessor's Office on to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15792)|
| 4:23:18| On this, looking at this, how did we arrive at the amount of local taxes abated annually at $406,700?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15798)|
| 4:23:31| In the negotiation of the lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15811)|
| 4:23:36| it appears that there was a worksheet that they worked off of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15816)|
| 4:23:40| that the taxpayer and the board looked at to come up with an in lieu of amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15820)|
| 4:23:45| How it was finally arrived at, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15825)|
| 4:23:49| But in the course of the review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15829)|
| 4:23:50| it appears that there was a worksheet provided that kind of said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15830)|
| 4:23:53| this is what we anticipate doing over the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15833)|
| 4:23:56| And then from that, they must have calculated a tax and then came up with an in lieu of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15836)|
| 4:24:01| Has it come up anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15841)|
| 4:24:06| Looking at the numbers there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15846)|
| 4:24:08| I know it's the inventory number was fairly close as they calculated it across as I reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15848)|
| 4:24:19| The other numbers I don't recall off the top of my head how close they were with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15859)|
| 4:24:25| You know, the number of new jobs down there, we've got down there is 375.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15865)|
| 4:24:30| They're laying off down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15870)|
| 4:24:33| Like I said, last time when you look at the agreement and you look through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15873)|
| 4:24:37| and having that set in there, I'm not sure, but it talks about, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15877)|
| 4:24:41| the transient job, the construction job during that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15881)|
| 4:24:43| And I think part of that was attributed to the actual construction of the facility out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15883)|
| 4:24:49| I did not read any language that talked about adding actual new jobs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15889)|
| 4:24:55| Well, on this benefit analysis, it says 375 new jobs, number of indirect jobs 368.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15895)|
| 4:25:06| Now, how do we know if we want to take in these construction jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15906)|
| 4:25:12| Maybe these people already work for a construction company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15912)|
| 4:25:16| How many of them are full-time employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15916)|
| 4:25:19| That I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15919)|
| 4:25:20| I mean, we were in a party to, you know, working out the agreement or sitting there, you know, on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15920)|
| 4:25:27| What we were doing was just reviewing the agreement as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15927)|
| 4:25:31| Nothing has come out positive on this agreement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15931)|
| 4:25:35| We've got new total annual sales estate tax, $2,120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15935)|
| 4:25:42| New annual estate sales tax, $1,284,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15942)|
| 4:25:48| And, of course, we know the paper doesn't pay sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15948)|
| 4:25:55| Where is all this sales tax revenue coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15955)|
| 4:25:59| Here, again, I believe when they sat down and looked at it and analyzed it and looked at the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15959)|
| 4:26:05| they looked at that as part of the individuals who are working would be spending money here in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15965)|
| 4:26:09| and, therefore, the county would recoup some sales tax that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15969)|
| 4:26:13| Like I say, we're not, you know, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15973)|
| 4:26:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15975)|
| 4:26:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15976)|
| 4:26:17| But I just can't believe that they're in compliance with their laying off down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15977)|
| 4:26:21| Well, there's nothing in the agreement, as you read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15981)|
| 4:26:24| that specifically states that they were going to have a number of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15984)|
| 4:26:27| Some of the agreements do deal with that, and they state in there how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15987)|
| 4:26:31| You know, as an exhibit to the agreement, they talk about these new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15991)|
| 4:26:37| But in the agreement itself, there's nothing in there that stipulates that X amount of jobs had to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=15997)|
| 4:26:42| Well, basically, what we did on this pilot program there, we bought all their equipment, $50,917,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16002)|
| 4:26:52| The value of the land we bought and paid for, $2,340,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16012)|
| 4:26:57| And all we're getting it back is they're paying the property taxes like it for the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16017)|
| 4:27:02| We basically put these people in business for their sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16022)|
| 4:27:05| Well, I think what the agreement was designed to keep them inside the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16025)|
| 4:27:10| and to also where they're located was to potentially build the city out that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16030)|
| 4:27:16| And in looking at it, I mean, as you read through it, that appears to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16036)|
| 4:27:21| talking with them, that appears to be what the agreement was designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16041)|
| 4:27:25| Because I think at the time they were actually thinking about moving outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16045)|
| 4:27:29| What kind of jobs did we lose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16049)|
| 4:27:32| They said they were going to maintain 600 jobs inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16052)|
| 4:27:38| What jobs were those that we maintained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16058)|
| 4:27:41| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16061)|
| 4:27:44| Well, I'll tell you, I don't know who negotiates the deals for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16064)|
| 4:27:47| but we sure need to hire a new negotiator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16067)|
| 4:27:54| You said the last time you were up here that we had 16 of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16074)|
| 4:27:59| We have the 16 other additional agreements, which we have got the agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16079)|
| 4:28:04| We're going through this and looking at analyzing which ones are just real estate only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16084)|
| 4:28:08| which ones will require a tangible business personal property to see if there's possibly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16088)|
| 4:28:16| noncompliance with sending in or filing to returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16096)|
| 4:28:20| So, we're going through that and I anticipate that there will be some more business personal property reviews done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16100)|
| 4:28:25| just like this one, that potentially could result in some new tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16105)|
| 4:28:30| But let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16110)|
| 4:28:32| When this tax abatement is over, this $50 million in equipment that they've bought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16112)|
| 4:28:41| are we going to tax them on $50 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16121)|
| 4:28:43| $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16123)|
| 4:28:44| They can't depreciate this right now, can they, since it's not theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16124)|
| 4:28:47| It is depreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16127)|
| 4:28:49| On the return as you file it, you file it based on year acquired, and it is depreciating down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16129)|
| 4:28:55| When it comes back on the records, it will be at the residual of 20 percent of the cost is where it will be on the return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16135)|
| 4:29:02| Well, that equipment belongs to the county right now, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16142)|
| 4:29:04| Right now it's the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16144)|
| 4:29:06| IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16146)|
| 4:29:07| The IDB board has the equipment that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16147)|
| 4:29:09| And that's the only way it can be exempt, as they're the ownership, through a bill of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16149)|
| 4:29:13| Where in a deal like this do they have the right to depreciate it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16153)|
| 4:29:17| I think if you read through the agreement, they don't lose those types of rights inside the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16157)|
| 4:29:24| What this is, the agreement is to produce an in lieu of payment on the actual taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16164)|
| 4:29:30| And the depreciation is actually the state return or the return that you use for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16170)|
| 4:29:36| You list your equipment by year acquired and cost, and it depreciates down each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16176)|
| 4:29:40| Well, they're really getting a break with IRS then on that, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16180)|
| 4:29:43| Even though it's not their equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16183)|
| 4:29:45| Well, like I say, reading through the language of the lease, it talks about that they don't lose certain rights as ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16185)|
| 4:29:52| you know, through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16192)|
| 4:29:54| I can go back and look at that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16194)|
| 4:29:56| But there is some language in there that addresses those types of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16196)|
| 4:30:01| Well, I just don't understand how they should be allowed to take a tax credit for property that's not theirs with the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16201)|
| 4:30:11| And I'm sure that shows up on their profit and loss sheet, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16211)|
| 4:30:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16214)|
| 4:30:15| That doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16215)|
| 4:30:16| I'd like to depreciate some of my neighbor's expenses on my income if I could, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16216)|
| 4:30:22| But this doesn't belong to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16222)|
| 4:30:24| I don't think they should be entitled to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16224)|
| 4:30:27| Like I say, I don't know who negotiates these pilot programs, things like that, but we certainly need another negotiator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16227)|
| 4:30:38| Thank you, Mr. Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16238)|
| 4:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16239)|
| 4:30:40| We'll take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16240)|
| 4:30:41| We'll go into zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16241)|
| 4:30:57| Clerk, can we have the roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16257)|
| 4:31:00| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16260)|

| 4:31:22| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16282)|

| 4:31:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16284)|
| 4:31:25| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16285)|
| 4:31:26| Commissioner White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16286)|
| 4:31:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16287)|

| 4:31:29| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16289)|
| 4:31:30| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16290)|
| 4:31:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16291)|
| 4:31:32| We have 16 commissioners present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16292)|
| 4:31:38| Do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16298)|
| 4:31:41| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16301)|
| 4:31:42| The page is unnumbered, but it's the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16302)|
| 4:31:47| Carpenters on the second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16307)|
| 4:31:54| We want to defer it to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16314)|
| 4:31:57| Both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16317)|
| 4:31:58| Both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16318)|
| 4:31:59| Is that a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16319)|
| 4:32:00| 8-E-O-8-S-P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16320)|
| 4:32:01| 8-E-O-8-S-P-H-I-O-8-R-Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16321)|
| 4:32:06| Tank, is this the church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16326)|
| 4:32:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16329)|
| 4:32:10| I just got a memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16330)|
| 4:32:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16332)|
| 4:32:13| It's the church there on Salt Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16333)|
| 4:32:15| Well, Tank, can we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16335)|
| 4:32:18| I actually talked to the secretary at that church, and they've had an illness, so they couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16338)|
| 4:32:26| We've already passed this once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16346)|
| 4:32:29| It was just for a technical issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16349)|
| 4:32:31| It had to come back before us over posting or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16351)|
| 4:32:36| We've already passed this once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16356)|
| 4:32:37| There's no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16357)|
| 4:32:39| Can we go ahead and pass this and save those folks a trip since they were kind enough to call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16359)|
| 4:32:46| I mean, you know, it's not like it's a real controversial one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16366)|
| 4:32:54| Jody, do you remember, did they call and what they said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16374)|
| 4:33:00| I've got an email on my email box right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16380)|
| 4:33:04| They actually did want to have it approved, but I couldn't guarantee that for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16384)|
| 4:33:08| and they couldn't have a representative here, so they opted to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16388)|
| 4:33:13| But if you would approve it, I'm sure they'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16393)|
| 4:33:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16396)|
| 4:33:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16397)|
| 4:33:18| We can suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16398)|
| 4:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16399)|
| 4:33:20| I bring the motion that we suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16400)|
| 4:33:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16403)|
| 4:33:24| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16404)|
| 4:33:25| Toward what purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16405)|
| 4:33:27| To go ahead and consider it even though it's been requested to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16407)|
| 4:33:30| Well, she said it was the request was because they couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16410)|
| 4:33:34| They would like to have someone here, but they couldn't have anyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16414)|
| 4:33:39| They would like to have it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16419)|
| 4:33:42| But that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16422)|
| 4:33:44| Our rules require that there be a representative here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16424)|
| 4:33:47| and we'll suspend the rules for that requirement to a representative be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16427)|
| 4:33:53| Suspension of the rules requires a two-third vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16433)|
| 4:33:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16435)|
| 4:33:56| Record me as a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16436)|
| 4:34:01| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16441)|
| 4:34:02| Well, I guess we need a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16442)|
| 4:34:05| Starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16445)|
| 4:34:07| To suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16447)|
| 4:34:09| It's just on these two items, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16449)|
| 4:34:11| And this is just a technicality like you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16451)|
| 4:34:14| Just a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16454)|
| 4:34:15| It has already passed once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16455)|
| 4:34:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16457)|
| 4:34:18| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16458)|

| 4:34:24| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16464)|
| 4:34:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16465)|
| 4:34:26| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16466)|
| 4:34:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16467)|
| 4:34:28| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16468)|
| 4:34:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16469)|
| 4:34:30| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16470)|
| 4:34:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16471)|
| 4:34:32| Commissioner Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16472)|
| 4:34:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16473)|
| 4:34:34| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16474)|
| 4:34:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16475)|
| 4:34:36| Commissioner Shelf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16476)|
| 4:34:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16477)|
| 4:34:38| Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16478)|
| 4:34:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16479)|
| 4:34:40| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16480)|
| 4:34:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16481)|
| 4:34:42| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16482)|
| 4:34:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16483)|
| 4:34:44| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16484)|
| 4:34:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16485)|
| 4:34:46| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16486)|
| 4:34:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16487)|
| 4:34:48| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16488)|
| 4:34:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16489)|
| 4:34:50| We will suspend the rules on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16490)|
| 4:34:54| Fourteen to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16494)|
| 4:34:56| Fourteen yes, two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16496)|
| 4:34:59| Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16499)|
| 4:35:01| Well, yes, we'll do it in two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16501)|
| 4:35:07| Mr. Chairman, members, on the agenda of Zoning Appeals 6A-06SP and 6H-06RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16507)|
| 4:35:19| I would request a motion to refer that back to MPC to evaluate and give their recommendation with respect to office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16519)|
| 4:35:31| This was for commercial, and we now are going to go back and get their recommendation on office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16531)|
| 4:35:36| and then maybe bring that back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16536)|
| 4:35:38| So it would take a motion to refer it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16538)|
| 4:35:42| They request that they give you their recommendation on office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16542)|
| 4:35:48| And I might say that they made some comments in their last analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16548)|
| 4:35:54| that seems to indicate that they might much prefer office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16554)|
| 4:36:00| Mr. Chairman, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16560)|
| 4:36:01| John, is that the second one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16561)|

| 4:36:12| Zoning Appeals is the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16572)|
| 4:36:13| It's the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16573)|
| 4:36:14| It's the only two items under Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16574)|

| 4:37:01| Do we need to make that as a form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16621)|

| 4:37:26| It's a request of Metropolitan Planning Commission for street name change from Hornet Way to Soaring Hawkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16646)|
| 4:37:32| The street's located between Williams Road and Dead End in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16652)|

| 4:38:16| 2nd District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16696)|
| 4:38:18| Mr. Chairman, it seems like an unusual designation for this very nub of a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16698)|
| 4:38:24| but it actually helps the community by putting a better development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16704)|
| 4:38:30| better property than what would otherwise occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16710)|
| 4:38:32| So I'm going to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16712)|
| 4:38:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16713)|
| 4:38:35| Probably moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16715)|
| 4:38:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16716)|
| 4:38:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16717)|

| 4:38:42| Next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16722)|
| 4:38:44| The next two items, the first is 6-A-08-SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16724)|
| 4:38:49| a request of LKM Properties for Northeast County Sector Plan Amendment from LDR Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16729)|
| 4:38:56| to NC Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16736)|
| 4:38:58| And 6-A-08-RZ is also a request of LKM Properties for rezoning from A.E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16738)|
| 4:39:04| Agricultural to C.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16744)|
| 4:39:05| General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16745)|
| 4:39:07| They're both located on the southwest side of Ellistown Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16747)|
| 4:39:11| southeast of Millertown Pike in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16751)|
| 4:39:15| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16755)|
| 4:39:18| Mr. Norvell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16758)|
| 4:39:21| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16761)|
| 4:39:24| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16764)|
| 4:39:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16766)|
| 4:39:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16767)|
| 4:39:28| The sector plan, I'm assuming that MPC has already approved the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16768)|
| 4:39:35| Is there any reason why sector plan change has still come before us given the Chancellor's ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16775)|
| 4:39:41| Is it just so that we conform, that we're agreeing with your sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16781)|
| 4:39:47| The recent change in the state law, and this is one of the items you have on your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16787)|
| 4:39:52| the first group of items here that are back before you, even though you've already adopted them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16792)|
| 4:39:57| they're back before you to correct or to address a technicality in the state law that was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16797)|
| 4:40:03| that we were not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16803)|
| 4:40:05| So that's why you have this item before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16805)|
| 4:40:08| The state law, as we understand it, requires the Planning Commission to adopt the plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16808)|
| 4:40:15| but also allows the Planning Commission to send those plan amendments on to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16815)|
| 4:40:20| So that's what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16820)|
| 4:40:21| Well, what would happen if this body turned it down for some reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16821)|
| 4:40:25| Would it even make a difference since you all are the ones that have to approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16825)|
| 4:40:29| I'm just wondering why these are coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16829)|
| 4:40:32| This one's a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16832)|
| 4:40:33| This one's a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16833)|
| 4:40:34| Even if it's a redo, the chancellor said that the authority is vested with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16834)|
| 4:40:45| The language here is very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16845)|
| 4:40:50| The Planning Commission approves the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16850)|
| 4:40:53| and then we are recommending that you adopt that amendment as well because you have adopted the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16853)|
| 4:40:59| and the general plan, which both have sector plans included by reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16859)|
| 4:41:07| So in order to keep the plan that you have adopted up to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16867)|
| 4:41:11| we want you to continue adopting any amendments that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16871)|
| 4:41:14| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16874)|
| 4:41:15| I just, you know, given what the chancellor said, that the power is vested with you, not with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16875)|
| 4:41:22| I don't mind coming back and rubber stamping what you all have done necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16882)|
| 4:41:27| but I just don't see why it still comes before us when the power, according to the chancellor, is being given to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16887)|
| 4:41:36| There is a provision in the new law that was passed this summer and went into effect in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16896)|
| 4:41:41| that gives the legislative body the ability to initiate a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16901)|
| 4:41:47| As long as they do it in writing, refer it to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16907)|
| 4:41:51| allow the Planning Commission to take action, then you can get it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16911)|
| 4:41:54| and you can approve that amendment regardless of the action by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16914)|
| 4:42:01| So a new law has given you some authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16921)|
| 4:42:04| So we've got some new authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16924)|
| 4:42:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=16926)|

| 4:44:37| There's some information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17077)|
| 4:44:44| And the only reason why I bring this up is that sometimes churches happen to be some of the most egregious violators of land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17084)|
| 4:45:00| policies in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17100)|
| 4:45:02| And I'm not, you know, this may be totally innocuous, but I just wanted to be sure of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17102)|
| 4:45:10| Commissioner, as I recall, I don't have the full staff report before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17110)|
| 4:45:14| But as I recall, I believe they're going to try to do that within their existing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17114)|
| 4:45:19| So there shouldn't be any additional impact on the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17119)|
| 4:45:24| In fact, I think, based on our map, pretty much all of the physical structures that are on the property now appear to be out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17124)|
| 4:45:32| more steep portions of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17132)|
| 4:45:34| So, as I recall from the staff report, I think they were going to try to do this within their existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17134)|
| 4:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17142)|
| 4:45:43| So the footprint's not getting any larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17143)|
| 4:45:45| There's no clearing that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17145)|
| 4:45:48| As I recall from the staff report, we don't have the full staff report here because this is one of the redos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17148)|
| 4:45:52| That's all I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17152)|
| 4:45:54| I couldn't tell from this whether there was tree cutting, clearing, an enlargement of the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17154)|
| 4:46:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17160)|
| 4:46:01| So if there's not, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17161)|
| 4:46:02| I think that's my assessment is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17162)|

| 4:51:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17497)|

| 4:51:54| where we can point stuff up here like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17514)|
| 4:51:58| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17518)|

| 4:52:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17529)|
| 4:52:10| That is what the MPC and that's what the staff recommended to MPC in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17530)|
| 4:52:15| making sure the plan amendment stayed out of the stream protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17535)|
| 4:52:22| And then on the rezoning, we made sure that the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17542)|
| 4:52:26| the recommendation was stayed south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17546)|
| 4:52:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17549)|
| 4:52:30| So the development is staying out of the stream protection area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17550)|
| 4:52:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17555)|
| 4:52:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17556)|
| 4:52:37| So that's the darkened borders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17557)|
| 4:52:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17559)|

| 4:52:54| Where's the stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17574)|
| 4:52:58| Is it going to sort of bisect that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17578)|
| 4:53:01| Is that what it's doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17581)|
| 4:53:03| You can almost see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17583)|
| 4:53:04| I believe you can almost see it in the lot that's affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17584)|
| 4:53:07| It's going right under STPA right there, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17587)|

| 4:53:20| And then you look at the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17600)|
| 4:53:22| The zoning, we made sure in terms of our recommendation that the zoning remained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17602)|
| 4:53:27| out of the stream protection area as well so that there's a clear dividing line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17607)|
| 4:53:33| between the stream protection area and the area he can actually use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17613)|
| 4:53:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17617)|

| 4:53:40| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17620)|

| 4:53:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17625)|
| 4:53:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17626)|

| 4:53:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17634)|
| 4:53:55| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17635)|

| 4:54:11| low-density residential, to C commercial and MDR, medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17651)|

| 4:54:24| to PC plan commercial and PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17664)|
| 4:54:27| They're located northwest and southeast sides of Ball Camp Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17667)|
| 4:54:31| northeast of Bakertown Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17671)|
| 4:54:37| The applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17677)|
| 4:54:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17679)|
| 4:54:40| Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17680)|
| 4:54:41| I'm here with Mr. Gentry and Mr. Wagner, who is the representative of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17681)|
| 4:54:50| We are requesting a change in what the NPC has recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17690)|
| 4:54:55| if I may explain after meeting and negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17695)|
| 4:55:01| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17701)|
| 4:55:05| Let's look for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17705)|
| 4:55:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17706)|
| 4:55:07| Whoever had the NPC report, if they can put it back up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17707)|
| 4:55:11| I can explain it pretty easily, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17711)|
| 4:55:15| You want the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17715)|
| 4:55:16| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17716)|
| 4:55:18| No, I think I can describe it if the map goes back up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17718)|
| 4:55:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17748)|
| 4:55:49| Stop right there, and I'll try to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17749)|
| 4:55:51| The property that would generally be at the northwest, it terminates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17751)|
| 4:55:56| and there are several houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17756)|
| 4:55:58| We would ask that a line be drawn parallel to that, 50 feet to the southeast, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17758)|
| 4:56:07| but parallel and leave that zone agricultural so there will be a buffer between those homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17767)|
| 4:56:15| an additional buffer between their homes and the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17775)|
| 4:56:20| That is change one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17780)|
| 4:56:21| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17781)|
| 4:56:27| Everybody duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17787)|

| 4:56:33| A little lower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17793)|
| 4:56:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17794)|
| 4:56:35| Just a parallel line right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17795)|
| 4:56:38| The back part, which is right here, we requested medium-density residential and planned residential at 1 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17798)|
| 4:56:50| We are requesting that that remain low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17810)|
| 4:56:55| but that it be zoned at planned residential at 1 to 5 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17815)|
| 4:57:00| which is consistent with the existing sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17820)|
| 4:57:05| The remainder of the MPC report we would or recommendation we would request remain intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17825)|
| 4:57:15| Mr. Wagner is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17835)|
| 4:57:16| Mr. Kirby was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17836)|
| 4:57:19| Oh, he went to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17839)|
| 4:57:21| But we have met with Mr. Wagner and Mr. R.L. Kirby and Mr. Reeves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17841)|
| 4:57:29| and have discussed it with them on numerous occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17849)|
| 4:57:32| And I think they're in agreement with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17852)|
| 4:57:37| Sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17857)|
| 4:57:39| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17859)|
| 4:57:40| We did, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17860)|
| 4:57:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17861)|
| 4:57:42| We did meet with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17862)|
| 4:57:43| And Mr. Gentry has been gracious changing the medium to 1 to 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17863)|
| 4:57:51| and also adding the buffer for the people on the upper road up there would be Ball Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17871)|
| 4:57:57| to become a buffer from the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17877)|
| 4:57:59| And none of this takes place until that extension of Shaw Road is complete, which is unfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17879)|
| 4:58:04| So nothing can happen in that area until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17884)|
| 4:58:07| And based on those recommendations or based on the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17887)|
| 4:58:10| and also the amendments that have been worked out between the community and the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=17890)|

| 5:02:31| If it's set at one dwelling unit per acre, that's consistent with agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18151)|
| 5:02:36| Why do we need to change to PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18156)|
| 5:02:40| The planned residential zoning district requires a development plan approval at the end of the use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18160)|
| 5:02:46| which allows the MPC to see the actual site plan as it's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18166)|
| 5:02:52| It will allow us to address the slope issues that are in that area and some of the water-related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18172)|
| 5:02:58| There are several lakes and streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18178)|
| 5:03:00| So, this, in effect, would skip the use on review process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18180)|
| 5:03:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18183)|
| 5:03:04| This creates the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18184)|
| 5:03:06| The ag zone skips the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18186)|
| 5:03:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18189)|
| 5:03:10| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18190)|
| 5:03:11| It also allows him to cluster instead of a one-acre minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18191)|
| 5:03:17| He has a gross density of one to the acre, so he can take those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18197)|
| 5:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18202)|

| 5:04:53| Yes, this coming Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18293)|
| 5:04:55| Two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18295)|
| 5:04:59| The other thing, who wants to step up and be on the task force for the 10-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18299)|
| 5:05:09| I'll volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18309)|
| 5:05:11| Commissioner Mark Harmon, would you like to be on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18311)|
| 5:05:13| I thought I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18313)|
| 5:05:15| What the heck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18315)|
| 5:05:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18317)|
| 5:05:18| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18318)|
| 5:05:19| Put me in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18319)|
| 5:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18320)|
| 5:05:21| Commissioner Saunders, we need one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18321)|
| 5:05:26| I'd like to nominate Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18326)|
| 5:05:31| You can't hide, Mike, by ducking over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18331)|
| 5:05:34| I was looking for my plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18334)|
| 5:05:38| I'll do it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18338)|
| 5:05:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18339)|
| 5:05:41| Mr. Chairman, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18341)|
| 5:05:44| Mr. Chairman, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18344)|
| 5:05:47| As Chairman of the Judicial Subcommittee, I believe it was Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18347)|
| 5:05:55| that asked us to look into the fees that are being waived by the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18355)|
| 5:06:01| I've been in contact with Dick Moran, and he's putting together some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18361)|
| 5:06:08| We hope to have a meeting first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18368)|
| 5:06:12| Also at that time, the judicial commissioners, they're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18372)|
| 5:06:21| We extended that until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18381)|
| 5:06:24| We're going to try to go over those applications also at that same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18384)|
| 5:06:30| You'll be hearing from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18390)|
| 5:06:31| There's three positions that are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18391)|
| 5:06:34| We've had several applicants and some very good applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18394)|
| 5:06:37| We have the three that are there are asking to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18397)|
| 5:06:40| So our work will be cut out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18400)|
| 5:06:43| But I just wanted to give you an update on that since you all had asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18403)|
| 5:06:46| The recommendation to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18406)|
| 5:06:51| I believe what will happen is on the judicial commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18411)|
| 5:06:55| that body will probably vote on a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18415)|
| 5:07:00| and then the full commission would take it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18420)|
| 5:07:04| and nominations would be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18424)|
| 5:07:09| This body here, if they so wish to set up some type of process, a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18429)|
| 5:07:17| similar to what we do with other appointments, we could do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18437)|
| 5:07:22| But that's something for this body to set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18442)|
| 5:07:26| And then the judicial subcommittee will have to come up with some type of process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18446)|
| 5:07:30| of how they're going to make their recommendations to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18450)|
| 5:07:34| Also, Mr. Chairman, I will have a report for you next month on cable TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18454)|
| 5:07:37| and a recommendation on how we need to proceed with the cable TV committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18457)|
| 5:07:41| And, Commissioner Harmon, I'd like to talk to you about our Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18461)|
| 5:07:45| Before you leave, I need to see you on one person on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18465)|
| 5:07:50| I do want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18470)|
| 5:07:53| A question regarding the homeless task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18473)|
| 5:07:56| Who's supposed to chair that, the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18476)|
| 5:07:59| I would say that you would get together as a body and select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18479)|
| 5:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18485)|
| 5:08:07| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18487)|
| 5:08:09| Make sure you get your laser pointer back to Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18489)|
| 5:08:13| You've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18493)|
| 5:08:14| Thank you, Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18494)|
| 5:08:17| Everyone have a happy holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18497)|
| 5:08:19| Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18499)|
| 5:08:20| And get well, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18500)|
| 5:08:21| Merry Christmas, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=18501)|
