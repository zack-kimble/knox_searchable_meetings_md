| 0:07:07| So first, Greyhound is a private, for-profit bus service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| owned by Flux Mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| This company was valued at more than $3 billion in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| They've worked continuously with Greyhound, both e-mail, phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| calls, Zoom exchanges, with the goal of collaborating with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| Greyhound to find solutions for the customers that use this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Regardless of our efforts, Greyhound has consistently failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| in its role as a private business to establish a service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=449)|

| 0:07:38| The city has offered useful services to Greyhound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| The city has offered use of the transit center during available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| hours, and with Greyhound covering those basic expenses of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| using that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Again, Greyhound has turned down this option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| On numerous occasions, they have initiated a service location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| that was not safe for its customers or appropriate based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| the zoning or the design of the facility, including Cherry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Street, a location on 6th Avenue, and now on Kirkwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| The Kirkwood location poses significant opportunities for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| operational challenges for CAT and is adding expenses to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| city, and also has safety risks due to site distance and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| customers that are out in the cold without appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| I think recently, one of the buses was canceled, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| individuals had to stand outside almost all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| It's just not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| So bottom line, Greyhound has failed to work with numerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| members of the mayor's executive team to find a service location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| in our community that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| We will continue to explore possible administrative or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=516)|

| 0:08:42| operations do not impede or add undue cost to our city, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| as changes that would hold Greyhound to a higher standard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| So I think the memorandum has more of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| Bottom line, we're there to work with Greyhound, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| solutions are really on Greyhound to come forward to us now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=536)|

| 0:11:15| passengers, including the media, to keep this story out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| I also want to appeal to any property owners or developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| who may have available properties that could be viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| options to serve as a Greyhound bus station, to provide safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| shelter to their passengers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| There is a local Greyhound contact here in Knoxville that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| some people may not be aware of that you could work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| I did not ask that person's permission to give out their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| contact, but if you are interested or have any options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| that you know of, you can reach out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| Here in Knoxville, one of the things that I think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| always have to be mindful of is that anyone who either lives in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| our city or comes through our city is part of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=716)|

| 0:12:02| their safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| And so I appreciate those of you who have gone above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| and continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| Also, I want to take this opportunity to invite everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| to come out and celebrate Christmas in Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=732)|

| 0:17:01| install a six-foot, six-feet privacy fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1021)|

| 0:18:08| He will continue to keep a close watch on this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| I knew then he was an extension to the field associates, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1093)|
| 0:18:21| believe they're check collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| The 3930 property owner has been accumulating junk for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| Their response to continue to watch this area is empty words to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| I have learned since my neighborhood was labeled as a white community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| in the past, and now this neighborhood is labeled as black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| There are two different sets of subdivision rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| Like in my last appeal decision session, it was said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| I would not want to live next to this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| Codes, what are you doing about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| And to help this lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| As a black community, the code departments decided not to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| the subdivision city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Now in retaliation, the owner of 3930 property has decided to complain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1161)|
| 0:19:29| about my fence project because he received a permit violation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| having a 51-feet shipping container on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| This is why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Because the owner of 3930 Avenue has been having his way for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| I should be able to update my property for my pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| Please approve my fence project as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| Thank you very much for coming and talking to council today about your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| I'll turn it over to members of council now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| and they may have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1211)|

| 0:20:31| we've got pictures here that show some of the building debris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| that Ms. Genoose mentioned here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| Is there someone that could come down and speak to why these things have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| not been cleared up on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1251)|

| 0:21:20| When this came to my attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| I asked our codes enforcement section manager to send somebody out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| Obviously, we treat it like every other project or every other complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| They went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| I don't know if they sent them a notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| but I believe that they did because by the time I met with Ms. Genoose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| I asked them to take a look again, and that's when they sent me photos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| I'm not sure which photos you were looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| but I understand this has been a problem in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| and whenever we get complaints, we definitely address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1311)|

| 0:21:59| Genoose met me in my office that everything was cleaned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| and I asked our codes enforcement officer or our section manager for codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| enforcement to please keep an eye on this area because apparently it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| historically been an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| And so that's the action that I've taken to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1333)|

| 0:22:30| property, and now it seems that because you've filed a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| that it has caused a potential rift with your neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| who does not appear to keep his property in an orderly fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| So I'll wait until my colleagues finish asking questions and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you, and I'm sorry that that's been your experience, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Yeah, I just want to clarify for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| I have talked to Ms. Genoose multiple times over the past couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| because I think at some point she was told that it was in the 4th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| and it has gone through multiple processes and the BZA marked as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| 4th District, but it's actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| this property is just off of Speedway Circle, so it is the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| So I just want to clarify for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Ms. Genoose, just so everybody kind of understands what you've gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| and what has been going on over time, you said you moved into your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| 1985?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| And the same neighbor, were they there at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| No, it was another family member living there at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| And so I want to make sure everyone sees page 159 in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1430)|
| 0:23:58| I've lost my, I just, I think it's really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| Ms. Genoose has called me and we talked about this a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| If you go to 159 in the packet, you can see the aerial shot from KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| Ms. Genoose, the neighbor had permanent temporary storage violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1450)|
| 0:24:19| which is the giant semi-truck, was actually in your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| And what did you do to have to get that remedied off of your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| I had to go to Small Claims Court and sue him to get it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| That started the process, and then I had to tend to send emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| complaining about, you know, he rectifying and pushing on his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| but then he started putting stuff on that container that was leaning just on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| the property line on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| So, and then when I kept doing that, then he got some orders or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| and then he decided to move the container off of the back area altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| And how long was that container back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| Well, I really don't know, because before I got sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| I was always leaving in the morning, come back late at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| That was my routine for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| And every time when I seen the container, one time I seen it back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| and all he would say, I'm putting it back there for just a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| work with me, and I'll get it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| And he would always say to me that when they separate the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| it was always at an angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| It wasn't straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| So he led me to believe that part of my backyard was really part of his yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| And I didn't question it because, like I said, my goal, my lifestyle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| was to get up in the morning before dark, leave, come back, and it's dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| Until I had the survey done back in March of this year or last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| probably this year, that's when I found out that it wasn't like he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| So it was a year, more than a year, that it was there on your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| A long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| And then he also owns the properties behind him but not behind you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| He owned the property on the other side of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| Whatever the street is behind you, you live on Alma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| I stay on Alma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Yeah, Alma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| And then what's the street behind that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| He owns properties that face Porter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Yeah, I've looked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| He owns properties that face Porter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| and then he owns properties diagonal across from you, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| And they're all covered, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| They're all covered in junk and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| The ones on Porter, I don't know nothing about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| But the ones diagonal, the junk, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| So my time is going to run up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Mr. Ahrens, could you just clarify for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| permanent temporary storage violations like the giant semi-truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| that he dumped in Ms. Ganuse's backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| that is a violation of our ordinances, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| And so we couldn't get him to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Ms. Ganuse had to go to small claims court to make that go away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| I don't know the details of that, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Well, I just wanted to point that out for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| because Ms. Ganuse has called me to talk about this over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| and I've talked to codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| and some of these things have been cleaned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| but it's not entirely cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| I'll let my colleagues ask some questions before I actually have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| I was wondering from our legal counsel if we could get some guidance on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| how the deprivation of beneficial use of land has been defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1687)|
| 0:28:20| because, well, for many reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| the responsibility of holding Ms. Ganuse's neighbor accountable to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1704)|
| 0:28:34| our ordinances require is the city's responsibility and should not be left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| to this private homeowner, and so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| there's a reason we have that statement that fences make good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| It seems like she's gone above and beyond to maintain, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| her quality of living in her home to the degree that she can without having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| an impact on her neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| And so as I review the details of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| it seems this ongoing situation has created a deprivation of a beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| use of her land, but I wanted to hear from legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| And, Council Member Parker, you're referring to Section 16.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| Variants and the Standards for Granting of Variants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Well, you know, I think variances are supposed to be given in limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| circumstances looking at the particular situation as it applies to this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| of property, and just because a variance is granted in one situation does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| mean that it shouldn't be granted in another situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| But looking at what this lady has stated, what she filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| and what's reflected in the record, as well as what other people have discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| you know, if somehow challenged, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| that I could defend granting a variance in this circumstance for this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| No matter what counsel decides on this issue this evening, Mr. Brace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| would you go to the property and review the issues that Ms. Janouse has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| dealing with and what she's seeing and try to help facilitate codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| and their ability to rectify what she's experiencing in her property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Yeah, we can absolutely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| We can go out there with Peter and Mr. Elder and look at the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| code violations, not specifically the zoning violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1847)|

| 0:32:45| Council, and we did not get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| But she grows on everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| No, as time went by, we had lots and lots of really good conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| and she became, for the Third District, we worked together a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1974)|

| 0:33:03| and she has had an influence in so much of Knoxville for so many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| that this was important to me to just acknowledge her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1988)|
| 0:33:16| Cindy, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=1996)|
| 0:33:27| I'll just keep it short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2007)|

| 0:34:24| the neighborhood at National Night Out, and that wasn't that long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| She really was a fantastic neighborhood advocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| really cared about our community, and she really will be deeply missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2072)|

| 0:36:18| I just wonder if you could step up and explain stop-loss for the record for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| general welfare of everyone understanding what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2186)|

| 0:36:30| We purchased stop-loss insurance to put a stop on how much we pay per individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| So we have a specific deductible that we would meet per individual of $275,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| So that's what we would pay for any member on our health plan and any amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2205)|

| 0:36:49| so I won't get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| But any amount over those, the insurance company picks up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| And I think it's important to point out always that the city is self-insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| And the stop-loss is required as part of that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2222)|

| 0:39:15| Yeah, I was just wondering if Mr. Bradshaw would like to come answer a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| So, I know one of the things in the packet about this item is that this particular contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| would allow you to expand the number, like add the police fleet maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| So are you going to expand the number of items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| I guess, tell us how this is different than what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Yeah, for the last nine years or so, we've only had these locator units on general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| The uniformed divisions were not participating initially, but I think the added capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| of the Samsara platform as well as the lower price per unit makes it a more viable alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| for those fleets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| And so we consulted with KPD staff and it's something they were interested in, so we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| to adjust the ask to account for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| And how is the information useful or used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| Well, it's got a lot of uses over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Obviously, asset tracking, knowing where your units, where your assets are in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| in real time is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| We've found a lot of value in the risk management realm in terms of claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| Claims come in, a vehicle has damaged my yard, tore up my mailbox, hit my car, whatever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| case may be, and this allows us to go back and trace where the vehicle was, when and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| where, and we can identify, one, if we did it, and two, who it was or which vehicle it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| was, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| That's been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| But there are other basic value in terms of security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| We have had some thefts over the years of our vehicles and they've all been recovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| relatively easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| You know, accountability purposes, there are a variety of alerts for excessive speed or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| hard braking, that sort of thing, coachable moments for driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| So it has that ability as well, it's just not location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2478)|

| 0:43:13| I know it's the one right over off Riverside Drive, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| Or go in that direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| I don't believe that's the location we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| We use the one that's got a different street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| That facility you're talking about is asking for an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Don't we use that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| This is the one off McMillan Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| Okay, so we take the construction waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| Oh, because you have two items on the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| No, it's just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| Okay, so we're not voting on moving the contract for the one that's over there off Riverside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| I believe they're McMillan Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Yeah, that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| So where exactly is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| It's in East Knoxville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Where in East Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| I am not voting on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| So let me jump in here since I've been in garbage a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| So the city actually many years ago had a city landfill which was off of Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| which is now a C&D landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| Past Cement Plant Road, you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Yeah, you go past Cement Plant Road and it is on your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| There's the big railroad transfer location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| So there is a C&D landfill off of Riverside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| and then there's a Class I landfill where household waste goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| which happens to be in Anderson County off of Raccoon Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| This is for the C&D landfill for the privately-owned former city landfill off of Rutledge Pike past Cement Plant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2683)|
| 0:44:51| Okay, that's what the location, the McMillan location is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Okay, do we use the one off Riverside Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Do we have contracts with that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Yes, we do at times utilize Riverside Drive, but we primarily utilize the Poplar location, the former city landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2701)|
| 0:45:10| I can get you, I believe that those owners would provide us with the lifespan of all three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| both our Class I and the two C&D landfills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| I can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| I don't have it tonight, but I can get that to council and we can e-mail it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Ms. McKenzie could do that tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| I get a lot of questions about that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| The Riverside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| Yeah, the one going out towards Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| And Mr. Weth has gotten e-mails from me about it because often they track mud in and out, various things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| There's just a lot of concern in the community out there about that particular landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| So I just wanted to clarify what business we do or don't do with that location and what the timeframes for it were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| because I believe in some conversations that I've heard that it doesn't have that much time left on it before it reaches capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2753)|
| 0:46:02| So we have also received complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| Obviously, landfill industries are gritty and dirty, but they do need to comply with all of our stormwater regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| I would say that the Riverside landfill, when you get those complaints, either go to Chad or to McKenzie or to our 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2771)|
| 0:46:21| and our stormwater team or our public service team could go out and check those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| When it comes to the actual regulatory authority for the landfill itself, it's the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| And we can, again, there's an e-mail I think that went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| It's been a few months about that landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| And so we could also forward that along to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| Okay, appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| Okay, I've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=2809)|

| 0:53:00| Some facts I would like for you to keep in mind in dealing with Greyhound is that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| working with a corporation, Flix, which bought Greyhound, which has various people working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3186)|
| 0:53:14| for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| The terminal, according to the Knox County Property Assessor's Office, the terminal was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| acquired in 1987 by Greyhound for $117,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3203)|
| 0:53:31| And November 1st of 21, first group services bought it for $206,000, and then four, five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3211)|
| 0:53:42| months later on February 28th of 22 of this year, they sold it to Knoxville Southern Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3222)|
| 0:53:50| for $1.45 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Now, if Greyhound is such an astute business, why did they sell a property for $206,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3233)|
| 0:54:04| which within months later in an area that they knew was being redeveloped, it sold for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| $1.4 million, $1.45 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| This is an instance of inbred corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3256)|
| 0:54:23| They've got the attorneys who've showed them, here's how you can drain all the money that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| been invested over these years and make quick buck off of it and not help continue to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3268)|
| 0:54:37| services for your customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| In March of this last year, Greyhound paid over $5,000 in utilities alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| That's not including the rent they were paying to first group services, but over $5,000 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| utilities to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| They went from there to try and ask their representative here in Knoxville to find them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| a place that for $500 a month, they could rent pavement to pull their buses off of and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3303)|
| 0:55:12| drop people off and pick them back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| It wasn't until those of us who were meeting the buses trying to serve some of their passengers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| complained that they finally relented and got porta-potties, one for disabled people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3322)|
| 0:55:30| and one for folks who aren't disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| For a while there, they were padlocking those after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| When they moved to North 6th, they did take the additional step of hiring security, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| is what they had at the station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| If you're going to, I'll back off, I'm not going to tell you how to negotiate on things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3348)|
| 0:55:56| like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| I just came from a meeting at the Burlington Business District Association where the Greyhound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| representative said that the city offered the CAT station for $600,000 rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| So there's misinformation going on out there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| This is all taking part because the federal government, under the auspices of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| sponsored by Senator Ted Kennedy, deregulated interstate bus traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| So all that's being regulated now, for the most part, are the buses, the equipment themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| Before it was over-regulation, you had to get your rate approved, you had to get your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| route approved, how frequently you did that, all that was being regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| It went from that to almost total deregulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| This is happening in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Chattanooga is the next that's going to be losing their station and pretty soon after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| that Nashville and Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| I would encourage you, this was a test to see if in the state of Tennessee, Greyhound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| could get away with doing a pickup drop-off spot for pennies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| I would encourage you to contact your cohorts and the city councils of Chattanooga, Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3431)|
| 0:57:19| Nashville and Memphis and see if there's something that collectively you can do or at the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| level legislation can be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| The ultimate solution is going to be at the national level while we're trying to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| out what to do here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| The ultimate solution is going to be at the national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| I don't have a great deal of hope at introducing new regulatory procedures right now under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3456)|
| 0:57:45| the government that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| The divided government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Anyway, those are just my comments, ask you to bring some facts to the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| We're not talking about some poor individuals, a poor corporation who's hard hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| They have the resources available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3483)|

| 0:58:10| Anne Jefferson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3490)|
| 0:58:18| Welcome to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Please remember to give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| I'm Anne Jefferson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| I live at 107 Flanagan Ave in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| Yeah, I just want to quickly make three points and thank the other people who've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| Greyhound also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| One is that I think it's important to remember that Greyhound is providing what we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| call an essential service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| We've learned a lot about essential services in the course of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| I think it's important to keep in mind that that's really what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| I guess what might be needed here is some sort of public-private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| But my second point is that Greyhound is not raking in huge profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| I'm almost convinced of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| The whole business model that FlixMobility is basing themselves on is that is of not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3551)|
| 0:59:25| paying any rent, of laying off almost all the employees, and doing everything online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| This is basically what Megabus did, as most of us in this room know, and pretty successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| I traveled a number of times on Megabus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Right now, although I'm a former Greyhound passenger, I wouldn't dream of putting myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| in the hands of Greyhound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| I mean, it's just simply too dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| You don't know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| Anything can happen while you're out there, and especially cancellations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| We heard earlier in the evening that it was outrageous that somebody might have to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| overnight outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| This is a regular occurrence down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| I mean, you have to come down and meet the people who are there in order really to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| what's going on with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| But so my point is, it's not like the airlines or the oil companies that we know are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| excess profits over the recent period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| It isn't that kind of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| They're not going to go along with a $400,000 or a $600,000 price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| That's not going to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| So that's, I mean, it's just pie in the sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| Greyhound didn't own its building on Magnolia after they sold it to First Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| And the people who got the money was First Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| They're the ones that sold Greyhound to Flix Mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| What Flix Mobility got was basically air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| They got the name Greyhound, they got the buses, and they got the routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| They got no real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| So it isn't as if we're looking at a company right now, it may be a $3 billion corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| or whatever, as we keep hearing in the messages from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| But the sale price of $1.45 million went to First Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| It didn't go to Flix Mobility, which is currently the owner of Greyhound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| So and finally, I just want to say that I really appreciate the memo that I just saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| that came from Aaron Gill to the city council about the work that the city is doing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3686)|
| 1:01:33| Greyhound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| But I think, as Vivian Scheip said in a video that some of you may have seen that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| making the rounds, we've got to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| We have to think outside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Let's lean on some of the property holders here in Knoxville and try to get them to step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Or a local church that might have a large parking lot and a small place where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| could wait and go to the bathroom and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| But Greyhound would have to provide some security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| It isn't up to me and it isn't up to you to solve Greyhound's problem for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| But I feel as though it is up to you to defend our human rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| I can't vote for the CEO of Greyhound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| But I can vote for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| And what we need from you is advocacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| We need you to care about what's going on in the Greyhound situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| Because it really is a very desperate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| It's really a crisis, except it's a chronic crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| It just goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| So anyway, I think I've said everything I needed to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Kent Menaud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Welcome to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3760)|
| 1:02:51| You've got up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| And please remember to give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Mayor. I'm Kent Minow. I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue. Good evening. I hope these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3778)|
| 1:03:07| comments supplement the comments that other people have just spoken. I wrote down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| I have an angry comment to make tonight, but I'll try not to deliver it in an angry tone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| I'm speaking my role as the chair of the Sierra Club State Transportation Team. And I'm angry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3800)|
| 1:03:28| because Greyhound bus travelers are being left in the cold without shelter, bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| or security. I know there are some people in the city working on this, some on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| council. I'm very grateful for your efforts. I'm a Greyhound rider myself, and I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| dropped off in some isolated places occasionally, but those places weren't in a prosperous city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| like ours. Going from airline travel to bus travel, you notice an immediate difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3829)|
| 1:03:57| Greyhound and other interstate bus systems are the transportation system for poor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| working people. My traveling companions on the bus dress differently, sound different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| and tell different stories. And they're more economically vulnerable with fewer resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| to deal with cold and hunger. That's a main thing that makes me angry, but I'm also angry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| because this problem is not new. Over 20 years ago, Greyhound attempted to secure a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| in Knoxville when the Clinton administration's Empowerment Zone money was available to secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| funding to help people in poverty. But in the shuffle of different businesses looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| for sites to occupy the city ultimately shut out Greyhound and stopped taking their calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| The proposal at that time was for a transit hub that Greyhound would share with CAT and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| other providers. Well, the money ultimately went to help build that CAT headquarters on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| Church Street. Now, I have a question about that. Why, when we have a building that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| already paid for with Empowerment Zone funds and taxpayer money, did the city ask Greyhound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| for the exorbitant sum of 600,000 a year to stop their buses in the CAT center? And please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3907)|
| 1:05:14| sorry, I'm starting to sound angry. Don't tell me there are liability issues because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3914)|
| 1:05:22| the liability would be handled by Greyhound. Here's some things I would like you to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| with the public. Can you tell us what Greyhound's response was to that offer? And who in city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3928)|
| 1:05:37| government is the point person for conversations with Greyhound? Who in the Chamber of Commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| has stepped forward since the chamber is the entity that helps businesses who want to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| a location in our city? If any of you in city government were dropped off in the dark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| and cold for a five-hour wait, how would you feel? This administration ran on a climate-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3956)|
| 1:06:05| campaign message, and we in the Sierra Club worked hard to get the candidate administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| elected. Are you all aware that a trip in a bus has far lower climate impact than a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| trip in a plane or a car? I'm angrily urging you to get your climate act together, immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3974)|
| 1:06:23| allocate emergency funds to shelter, feed, and protect Greyhound passengers, and to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| rapidly to create a long-term relationship with Greyhound that allows poor and working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| people a clean and proper place to handle the delays and inconveniences that accompany| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| any kind of travel. The current situation is an embarrassment to our city. I can't imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| you don't feel the same. Thank you for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| Constance Everey, welcome to public forum. You have up to five minutes. Please give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4009)|
| 1:07:01| your name and address. All right. My name is Constance Everey. Why is my time starting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4021)|
| 1:07:14| I haven't even gave my address and stuff yet. My name is Constance Everey, and my address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| is 201-86 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37940. And Mr. Kent Menegal kind of hit all my points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4039)|
| 1:07:27| because he's right. This is not a new conversation. I'm going to add an additional enlightenment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| to the Greyhound bus station as well. Let's talk about 2020, when Avison Young announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| the selling of Greyhound bus station. And additionally, what was also happening at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| time, oh, Randy Boy's baseball stadium was additionally the conversation that was occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| And as he pointed out, this is a zone that has much benefit and much gain for a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4066)|
| 1:07:54| such as Randy Boy himself. So I hate to say it, Knoxville, but you're always a day late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| a dollar short, and late to the conversation. And y'all, as the public, keep missing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| this council actually began doing and discussing. In my opinion, the Greyhound bus station situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| is working exactly to the advantage as the city of Knoxville and Randy Boy's development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| wants it to work. This was intentional. They don't want this here any longer because, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| has been already highlighted, this is a form of poverty travel. I, too, am a rider of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| Greyhound bus station, especially in my college days. This is how I got back and forth from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| home to visit for the holidays and back to school. So, again, this is an issue that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| be resolved. Why are we not finding solutions? Because who's really suffering? The people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| And so to highlight what Ms. Vivian Scheidt pointed out, we are asking Knoxville to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| something that you've never been able to show, humanity, because the key word of humanity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| is human. And the way this council is callous in its behavior and nature of humanity is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| beyond me. For example, the debt. To me, the Greyhound bus station is only a shining example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| of the continued problematic issue of Knoxville at its core value. We have issues of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| and we have seen that cycle. We have issues of gun violence, and we're watching that cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| We have issues of poverty. We're watching how that continues to be an effective, rooted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| cause of all the surface issues we're dealing with. We have a police chief who is costing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| taxpayers money because of the Freedom of Information Act that, when you talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| federal government, law has been violated right now because we can't find out how he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| even got here for his employment in the first place. And not to mention, $43,000 was spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| on that effort with an additional $120,000 in the court costs we're spending right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| But then we get told all the time how we don't have money. Well, we got money for all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| things that we're wasting money on right now. 60% of the city's homeless rate is due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| to affordability of housing. And we just found out the market went up by another $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| So guess what? It's not getting more affordable. It's getting even more unaffordable. But here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| the kicker, Knoxville. I watched tonight in this very agenda how you all do understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| the understanding of community land trust because you gave somebody $510,000 for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| affordable rental development. But you can't give us community land trust to do the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| thing or to address things like food disparities or medical deserts. We got elderly folks really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| worried about how they're going to get to a hospital and live because there's 30-minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| different differentials now versus 10 and 15 that used to exist when we had Baptist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| on the South Side and we had St. Mary's on the North Side. Let's get serious about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| conversation, Knoxville, that we're really having here. Y'all playing games. Realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| how long we sat here. Y'all only give us 25 minutes of what's supposed to be a people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221129?start=4236)|
