| 0:00:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=56)|
| 0:00:57| Do I have a motion to approve the minutes of the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=58)|
| 0:00:59| I have a new person to introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| I don't want to say a replacement person, but a new person to introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=62)|
| 0:01:07| Mark Bird, the gentleman on the end with the glasses, is the liaison between the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=67)|
| 0:01:13| the business office, the tax office, and anything else that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| And he will be the one that, if you have contact with that office, you will be speaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| most of the time, but occasionally Cliff, who's sitting back there, will, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| be stepping in, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| So we're looking forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| This is the first beer board with the new regime, and I use that term lately, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| gone very well so far, so we'll keep it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| When I call the name of the business that's applying for the permit, representative needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| to come to the podium, speak into the microphone, and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=104)|
| 0:01:52| Applicants who are approved pending final documentation need to take that documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| to the business tax office during business hours when it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| Applicants, if you have your permit approved tonight, you can pick it up at the end, E-N-D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=123)|
| 0:02:11| of this meeting, and that's because for you to be trying to pick up your permit and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| moving on to the next application causes a little confusion and chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| So just wait until the meeting's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| And most people know that this meeting moves pretty fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| Beer board members, we're still saving trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| The first case before us tonight is 17th Street Market and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=151)|
| 0:02:41| My name is Akbar Jamal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=161)|

| 0:03:32| task class done and the other inspections are finished, you'll be ready to pick up your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=212)|

| 0:05:46| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=346)|

| 0:06:18| But having been to the beer board before, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| I did not know I had to have new prints after so many years of having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=381)|

| 0:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=767)|

| 0:12:56| We foreclosed and took over the hotel on September 5th and had an amicable transfer of the permit at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| but because it was foreclosure, it became an unfortunate legal matter between us and the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| I'm proud to report, since this is a public forum, that the employees were paid by Columbia Sussex, the former owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| today and have confirmed that with the workforce today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| So we have been extremely rushed, and you may find some pieces that have not been completed on our application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| but we have done everything we can in a very short period of time to get that submitted under the extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=809)|
| 0:13:37| We also had an issue of miscommunication with Max Zickra on his background check today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| They had asked him where he was born, and he was born on a plane from Cyprus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| and he said Cyprus when his actual documents say Syracuse, New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| So I believe that may have delayed his background check, although I believe Mr. Goyle has passed his today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| Okay. Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| He is correct. We have not gotten the background check on Manager Zickra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| Also, we're missing a task requirement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| We do have that letter that shows we have the tax certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| No, this is a task. This is a training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Yeah, right, and he is scheduled to take that Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Okay, that's good. Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| We are still needing the building inspection approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| We have requested and contacted multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| We got all the other inspections done, so we're hoping because it is a big game weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| we can try and sell beer this weekend for tax revenue for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore, Suite 700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| As you previously explained, the issue with foreclosure and the amicable agreement that seemed to be resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| and would allow for a 60-day kind of transfer of vendor status with the previous owner staying on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=898)|
| 0:15:06| to accommodate that abruptly fell through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| I believe my clients were notified on the date that the permit was surrendered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| which happened to be close in time when the previous task last week was scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| Again, got reservations that are pretty much booked up for the upcoming game weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| and a lot of these intended guests are longtime Marriott customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| and believe in talking with Sergeant Coward that the background inspection report should be back first thing in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=933)|
| 0:15:41| So I guess what we plead to this board is that pending approval of the background inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| if we could get a recommendation of approval with that exception and with the task last being completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=947)|
| 0:15:56| considering the postponement of a 30-day and kind of the extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=956)|
| 0:16:05| Madam Chair, we are trying to do our best way possible to conduct the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=965)|
| 0:16:13| We have other businesses in Tennessee in which we are doing it in a lawful and successful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| Unfortunately, we had a situation up here we were not prepared for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| and as an owner, as an investor here in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| I would just like to plead if we can be given a chance and time so that we can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| and so that we don't lose the revenue, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| I would really appreciate it if a little help can be done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| But again, we'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| We'll start with Councilman De La Vope and then go to Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| Do we have one of the two owner or managers that have a full approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| No, we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Mr. Goyal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Mr. Goyal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| We do have his background check and fingerprints and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| but the task requirement has not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| And that class is what, this Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| And we were not able to sign up ahead of time because it's not we cannot sign up ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| but I'll personally make sure that Max is going to be there first thing in the morning to attend that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1045)|
| 0:17:32| Can I ask Mr. Frost a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Is it possible for them to have a caterer come in and be the server for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| That's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| They might be able to do it that way if, I mean, council doesn't break with policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| I was wondering if a licensed caterer could actually solve your problem for this weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1066)|
| 0:17:55| because they would have legal authority to sell beer, I guess, and that's, anyway, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| Councilman Grieve, Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| You know, we just went through Randy's situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| and Randy is a long-term person who has several restaurants around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| and we turned him down because of the same reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| And it's just one of those unfortunate situations, but, you know, we're not here to solve problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| We're here to follow the rules, and we've made rules that said that if these things were missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| we would not approve, and that, so I make a motion we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| I guess, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| Mr. Frost, can they not take Mr. Zekra off, and then we approve it pending the final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| In other words, the guy that doesn't have the fingerprints process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Because one of the applicants has the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| He has to take the task class Thursday, though, which we approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| We could approve with him taking the task class on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| They won't get the permit until he takes the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| The other person on the application has not gotten his things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| Take him off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Can we take Zekra off and approve it just with Goyle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| I mean, I may be mispronouncing these names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Is that what you're thinking as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Don't we regularly do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| I don't know about regularly, but it has been done, removed one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| But the owner, I mean, you need the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| You have to have the owner, but you don't have to have the manager is kind of what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Would you all be okay, Mr. Forster, would you be okay with moving Mr. Zekra from the application and just be Mr. Goyle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| Correct, and then proceed with Mr. Zekra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| We'd need to come back for another meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| And I can, in talking with the client, TABC approvals and everything have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| I know this is a different body, but just to show that compliance has been followed through with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| Mr. Frost, a question has arisen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| Does the, ask your question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| For the task requirement, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| we have to have an on-site owner or manager for the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| Yes, there has to be someone that is located within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Right, and Mr. Goyle, you reside out of Knoxville, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| Yes, but if you want me to move, I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Do you know where you can get a room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| I can have a room for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| How about Airbnb, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Whoa, whoa, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Okay, we're really into the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| I do understand, sir, Mr. Vice-Chair, Vice-Mayor, sir, that, you know, I sit on some boards in Arkansas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| so I do understand your position, but it's just some small glitch happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| and we had all the agreements in place for 60 days so we can comply and we don't lose any business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| but when somebody comes in and all of a sudden pull a rug out of your thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| and, you know, as you said, they were not paying their employees, but they got paid them today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| and all this thing happened, it's all business situation, so that's why we're just trying to see if you get the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| I can understand what the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Mr. Frost has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| A foreclosure is a total change in ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I don't think they could have transitioned the permit because the ownership would have, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| it would have changed, so I don't think that plan was going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| I mean, I think we've got a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| They've removed the person that doesn't have the background check, and we can approve it with Mr. Goyle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| and I think that's, I mean, I'm here to help solve problems, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| so, I mean, I think we should try to work with the business owners, and they're obviously trying to be, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| Make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| There's a motion to postpone, so that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| A motion to postpone, you know, takes precedence, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| You'd have to vote on it, and it would have to lose to do anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| If the motion to postpone prevails, then it's postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| Oh, he could withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Does anyone want to withdraw a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| I'll withdraw if we can go back and review the former application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| That'd be a separate motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| If we can reconsider Mr. Burleson, who says that he can open within 10 days, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| Well, then you had an, there was also another individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| Is there another, well, yeah, there's several individuals we've turned down today because of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| So, no, forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| So you want to maintain your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| You want to maintain your motion that we postpone this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| For 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| For 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Is there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1393)|

| 0:23:16| There already was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| All those in favor of postponing for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1400)|

| 0:23:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Do you think we need to call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1405)|

| 0:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| That fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Now, Councilman Stair, do you want to make your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| I move to approve the application pending final documentation with the removal of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| applicant who had his fingerprints, Mr. Zikra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| All those in, oh I'm sorry, Councilman de la Bouffaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Just a quick thing, and they have council there, but it is possible also that they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| hire a caterer for this weekend, which was his biggest problem, was short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| I don't know if you want to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| It's money out of pocket, but you would have a licensed beer distributor person there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| and that would be a solution, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Right, and I think we'd prefer Mr. Steyer's motion on the basis that it wouldn't be, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| we'd be postponed, I'm assuming, for four weeks before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| I just want to make sure that was communicated well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| It's obviously a struggling property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| So do y'all have your liquor license in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| That's another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| So they have the state license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| So we have Councilman Steyer's motion to remove one of the names and approve this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Okay, same two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| All right, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1510)|

| 0:25:14| Was the motion approved subject to task?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| And the building's location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| There was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| It was final documentation, and task is part of that final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1523)|

| 0:27:01| that we would approve pending on the missing task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1621)|

| 0:27:08| We don't approve if they don't have their records check and background in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| And so he has the records check in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| It's the task that they're missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1636)|

| 0:29:53| What is the event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Oh, yeah, do you want to tell us about the event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| It is a fundraiser for youth boxing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| Owen Beck is a former WBC boxing champion that he's been helping youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1802)|
| 0:30:11| and he's been paying for everything out of his own pocket to bring those kids in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| So this is to help him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| All right, next is Moe's Market and Deli on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1820)|
| 0:30:32| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1832)|

| 0:30:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Now, Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| We're missing the fingerprints and background check on owner Muhammad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| Okay, Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| We need building inspection approval, fire prevention approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| the plan for server compliance, and the surrender of the previous permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| Okay, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Move we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Okay, when you get your background check and all your other things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| I already did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| Well, there's two gentlemen on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Okay, which one does not have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Huda Muhammad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Huda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Huda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| He's the one that did not get the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| But this gentleman did get the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Yes, his background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| I am the owner and the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| It says on here that Huda Muhammad is an owner also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| She's my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Well, she was listed on the application and the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| so we need to have a fingerprints and background check on her as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| You're back to the proposition that you could have her removed from the application, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| She's an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| She's an owner, not a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| She's just a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| The gentleman who was listed as the owner was listed as the 100% owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| So this is different because this gentleman is represented, he's 90% owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| and the one person missing is 10% owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Okay, we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Okay, then we will hear your case on October 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| This is the 9010 you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Because one of the co-owners does not have the background check and the fingerprints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| and that's a requirement of this beer board in order to approve a permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| But she's not going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Well, then she shouldn't have had her name listed on the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| because when the name is on the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| our understanding is that person will be involved and be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1987)|
| 0:33:18| All right, next is the SWB Holding Company, and they have two applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| One is for an on-off premise, and the other is for manufacturing and distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| So we will take the on-off premise application first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Patrick King, 312 South Gay, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2016)|

| 0:33:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Counsel Delavope, is that an old light, a new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| No, I'm sorry, that's the old light, and I didn't remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2040)|

| 0:34:03| Motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2050)|

| 0:39:17| and that you are correcting all the things that led to this as much as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| We also understand that sometimes servers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| and owners don't always have the same ideas about checking IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| but we're sure that will be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| Folks, are you ready to just accept this as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Was there an ABC action as well or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Did you have a TABC citation also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| That's pending with them currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Well, we typically don't take any further action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| but when you get the TABC ironed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| you'll get another call from us to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| and typically this board, that's just the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| and our lawmakers think that that's really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| so we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| So if no one has an objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| we'll accept the plan and the fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| and say that we'll never see you again on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| You can count on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Next is Zoe's Restaurants in Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Actually, they're from Nashville, but they're on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| They were cited on November 17, 2016, sent in a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| They were cited again on August 16, 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| and they did not respond with the fine before the deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| nor a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Now, they since have come in with a remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| and they also have paid the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| but per the rules of the beer board and the operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| they need to go to the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| because this is their second action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| and they did not meet the deadline with the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| So that triggers going to the hearing officer at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| It's a shall, and the law department has already filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| a noncompliance complaint against Zoe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| And I talked with their attorney about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| and he understands what will have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Suite 700,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| This matter made it late to Zoe's headquarters in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| I just got retained on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| I believe the issue that happened was a citation was issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| or the data violation, and speaking with the manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| who's here with me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| they didn't receive that until a week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Sent it to legal at Zoe's headquarters in Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| and I guess the process of making its way through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| they called me in a panic Wednesday night or Tuesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| and finally got everything retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| And working with Kim Pouncey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| and she worked for us over the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| and came up with this brilliant revised remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| and kind of got it finalized and buttoned up and submitted today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| but understand the five-day requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| Okay, you need to explain all that to the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| when you go and you should be getting the paperwork on that sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| All right, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| What's their status in the interim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Are they suspended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| No, they can still serve until...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| They just have to answer for the charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| They have to answer for their transgressions, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Were you also cited by TABC or just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| Correct, and we've spoken with their general counsel in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| and I believe we have that one worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Okay, all right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Did you have a business before the Beer Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| I have a constituent who has sold his business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| and when they sold the business they destroyed all the records they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| and so the new person that wants to go in, they're asking for the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| and it doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| So what do you do in that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| You have to surrender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| You have to surrender the previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Do they send an affidavit saying it's gone or what's the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| The owner can ask for a duplicate and then surrender it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| The original owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| The original owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| Yeah, the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| The departing owner, the original owner could ask for a duplicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| The burner, the burner can ask for a duplicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| Right, the original owner that's the former owner now could ask for a duplicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| Does the original owner have to ask for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Because he's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| It's up to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| If he doesn't surrender it, then it has to go in front of a hearing officer to be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Okay, so to be clear then, what my constituent needs to do is to get with the former owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| if he can find them, have them come and get a duplicate copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| If he cannot find the former owner, then he has to come, he has to go before the hearing office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Counselor, Vice Mayor Gray, if he can't find the former owner, call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| and then I'll speak with the law department, our Sergeant Cowart or Ms. Dyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| and they'll get those wheels turning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| But it would be a whole lot quicker if he found the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| And if the former owner has the original permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| Or he can ask for a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| He can ask for a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| But it has to be from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170926?start=2683)|
