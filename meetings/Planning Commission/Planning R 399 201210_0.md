| 0:10:11| you know that from the attendees. Mr. Jackson and Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| All right. Chair will recognize Mr. King. Mr. King, are you available to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=619)|
| 0:10:33| I'm available. Can you hear me now? Faintly, but yes. If you could speak up a little louder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| please, sir. Okay. I'll speak a little bit louder. As to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| the item you mentioned for postponement for 60 days, we would object to postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| We'd like to go forward today and particularly a postponement for 60 days. This is a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=652)|
| 0:11:03| that's been pretty well known for quite some time. And I'm not sure I understand exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=663)|
| 0:11:14| what the reason was for requesting postponement from the Commission member who did so. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=674)|
| 0:11:26| respectfully request that we go forward on the matter and dispose of it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=686)|
| 0:11:36| I just delay always is a problem. Delay has been the mainstay response to development of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=696)|
| 0:11:53| property since we started with it a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| Thank you, Mr. King. We heard your objections to the postponement. There's a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=721)|
| 0:12:09| in a second to postpone for 30 days. Call the roll, Ms. Cairn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| Yes. Commissioner Utena?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| Yes. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=740)|

| 0:12:32| Yes. Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| Yes. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Yes. Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Yes. Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Yes. Commissioner grand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Yes. Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Yes. Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| Yes. Commissioner Hill. Yes. That's, oh, Commissioner Scott Smith, my apologies, Scott. I'm recused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=769)|
| 0:13:01| on the 30 days postpone list. I thought it was an automatic postponement. My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| So you can vote on the 30 days? Okay, I'll vote yes. Thank you. I'm sorry. 14 ayes, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| Chair. Motion carries. Next, there are items to be postponed for 60 days. Item number 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=797)|
| 0:13:30| Uber Properties, LLC, Clearwater Partners, LLC. Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| Motion to postpone. Second. We have a motion by Commissioner Ross, seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=818)|
| 0:13:46| Buston, to postpone for 60 days. Ms. Cameron, would you call the roll, please? Yes, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| Utten. Question. Is this time for discussion of the motion? Excuse me, Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=833)|
| 0:14:04| Commissioner Korbelik. Unmute, please. I'm new to the commission and I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=844)|
| 0:14:12| Was it the applicant who said he wanted to proceed? The applicant's attorney, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| was representing that request. And I didn't quite understand the exact reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| to insert a postponement contrary to the applicant's request. That would be a staff issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| Commissioner, but I don't think there is a requirement that any commissioner has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| specify the reason for a postponement. I thought, Pat, I don't mean to jump in here. If the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=880)|
| 0:14:48| that made the application doesn't want the application and he wants to hear it, I thought we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| would allow them to bring it up at the normal time of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| That's not my understanding, but I'll let either our attorney or Ms. Brooks comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| Mr. Wise? That has generally been the practice. If the party objects to a policy matter on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=905)|
| 0:15:16| postponement list, it is heard at the regular time and considered for postponement or action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| at that time. That is typically the way it's handled, historically. That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| Thank you, Pat. I'll just make the motion when the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| So item 21 will not be on postponement for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| Okay. So I guess we need to get that motion, remove that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| Yes, sir. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| I'll make that motion. I'll second it, Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Motion by Utent and seconded by Commissioner Scott Smith to resend that previous motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| Call the roll, Ms. Cairn. Yes, Commissioner Utent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=962)|

| 0:16:59| Chair, we'll entertain a motion to postpone items as read for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| I make the motion to postpone those items for 90 days, Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| I'll second, Smith. We have a motion by Commissioner Korbelek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| seconded by Scott Smith to postpone for 90 days. Call the roll, please, Ms. Cairn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1034)|

| 0:18:01| which is composed of items marked with a C. These items are considered non-controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| and are voted all at one time in order to save time. Please listen carefully. Once an item is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1087)|

| 0:19:07| So moved. Second, Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| We have a motion by Commissioner Ross, seconded by Commissioner Buston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| to approve the consent items as read. Call the roll, please, Ms. Cairn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1155)|

| 0:19:58| Commissioner Dent. Ms. Cairn, could I interrupt you for one second, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Notice that there is a hand up on the consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| And if you don't mind, Chair will recognize John Fairstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| Yes, this is John Fairstein, 11205 Sam Lee Road, Knoxville 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1217)|
| 0:20:28| And this is in regard to 19C, Hayden Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| And I got most of my questions answered before the last minute before the meeting from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| Aaron Fritz at Knox County Engineering, that the entrance on the southeast side has been modified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1241)|
| 0:20:50| which is good. And the effect of any widening on Sam Lee Road with respect to our water well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1250)|
| 0:20:59| won't have any impact. And I apologize, I could have addressed this to staff before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| but a lot of two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Excuse me, Mr. Fairstein, we can't discuss the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| Do you wish the item to be removed off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| Yes, until I get my questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| All right. So we will remove item number 19 from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Commissioners, I apologize. Let's, based on that, also, I want to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| Commissioner Dent. Her hand is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| Yes, we can continue the vote for consent, but I did notice correspondence coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| for a 30-day postponement. Excuse my lateness on that. I was trying to find the email just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| confirm, so we can discuss after the vote. Okay. All right. Ms. Camp, we can go back, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| and start from the beginning on the roll call with the exception of 19 being removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1314)|
| 0:22:02| We need to secure a motion to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| I'll make a motion to do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| Motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith, seconded by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Well, rather than taking a vote on that, if you could simply go back to whoever made the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| original motion to approve consent and ask them to amend it, the motion, and get the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| and have that amended, then we just have to do one roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| Does, Dory, do you have your note show who made the original motion to approve consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Yes, Commissioner Ross, seconded by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| Would you, commissioners, would you agree to the amendment to delete item 19 from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| commission, from the consent list? Yeah, it wasn't approved consent except for number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| Okay. So, now proceeding safely, your record is in good shape. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1367)|

| 0:23:42| we've taken off, we've withdrawn that one. So, moving on to agenda item number 10. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1422)|
| 0:23:51| applicant is Taylor Forrester on behalf of the offices at St. Andrews LLC. Property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1431)|
| 0:23:59| located on the east side of East Walker Springs Lane, north of I-40 and I-75. Applicant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| seeking a rezoning from Office Park to Multifamily Residential Neighborhood, RN-6. Staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| is to rezone the property to General Residential, RN-5. This application will require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| Is the applicant present, Mr. Forrester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1462)|
| 0:24:30| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| All right. We're showing a number of individuals desiring to speak on this. I think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| a total of 16. However, you know, we can't allow all 16 to speak. We don't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1478)|
| 0:24:46| If those 16, if you want to have a couple of spokespersons, that'll be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1486)|
| 0:24:54| Mr. Forrester, would you like to go first or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| I'd like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| I had something that needed to be postponed for 30 days. I'm sorry to interrupt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| but I saw correspondence from Taylor Forrester for item number 11 from Tuesday to postpone for 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1506)|
| 0:25:15| days. It's 12-B-20-RZ. Can we not vote on that or is it too late for that to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1515)|
| 0:25:24| I'll make that up right after this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| It can be voted on when the item comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| When the item comes up as well as item number 24, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| Item number 11 and 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Okay. We'll postpone those. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. Mr. Forrester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1539)|
| 0:25:47| continue, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Yes. Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee. Here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| on behalf of the applicant whose office is at St. Andrews and also the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| This parcel is located specifically at 8300 East Walker Springs Road. And as you can see on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| screen, it is immediately adjacent to the westbound lane there at Interstate 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| The current zoning for the property is zoned under RECODE as Office Park. Office Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| as you're probably aware, is intended for large office developments and office park campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| And another potentially popular use and permitted use there is for the hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| These parcels that are zoned Office Park are usually larger parcels like this that are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| to have a fairly sizable type of development on it in that Office Park zoning. We submitted our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1600)|
| 0:26:49| initial application requesting rezoning to RN6. Staff has recommended a lesser zoning of RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1609)|
| 0:27:00| We will consent to that and are agreeable to that and hope that you recommend approval of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1620)|
| 0:27:08| The RN5 zone is intended to accommodate medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| that are medium-density residential neighborhoods that are comprised of single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| townhouses and multifamily. The proposed use for this property would be for the development of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| apartments multifamily. The RN5 zone and the reason to seek that rezoning or to agree to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| that rezoning is that it's intended to serve the functional transition between the single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| neighborhoods like St. Andrews there to the north of Arsenal. A lot of comments on the use of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| property, the concern of the greenway and the vegetation on the property. The property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| the applicant, in meeting with the St. Andrews residents back in September this year to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| the proposed or hopeful development and rezoning that would take place with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| There were meetings and discussions and emails and phone calls that went back and forth and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| the applicant property owner developers is keen on continuing to work and listen to their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| when it comes to landscaping, creating certain buffers, site layout. As far as the concerns over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| the greenway, there will be no destruction or interference or impact to the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1705)|
| 0:28:34| Property owner has no intent to do that nor would the city ordinances permit that. In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| the property owner is the same one that donated real estate and the land here for the connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1720)|
| 0:28:48| of the greenway. In these conversations with the residents of St. Andrews and also talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1728)|
| 0:28:56| with West Hills, initially there was a lot of concern about noise from the interstate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| thoughts that the tree vegetation and the trees that are existing on this parcel serve as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| buffer. So we looked into having an assessment performed by sound engineering. I've included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| that. The sound engineer's assessment results actually find that solid structures like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| proposed apartment buildings actually serve as a better insulator and buffer than the vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| there. Vegetation actually did not, based on his assessment, does not offer a lot of insulation or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| buffering or reduction. Although this is a rezoning, we've already moved forward and had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1776)|
| 0:29:45| traffic impact study prepared. Obviously, this site is not accessed through any residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| neighborhood or along the same streets as residential neighborhoods in the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| vicinity. It has its own separate access. That traffic impact study does recommend the installation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| of a red light there at East Walker Springs and North Gallagher View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| That would be on the cost of the property owner to move forward with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| You know, there's been some concern as to or comments on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| this not coming back for use on review type approval and submit that under the recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| we have a lot more zoning ordinances now. We have more specific zoning ordinances and within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| these zoning ordinances, you have more detailed requirements under like a site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| You have a lot more detailed landscaping plans that you have to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| You have tree preservation plans that they're under the existing ordinances now as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| prior to recode. You know, under the prior code, you had more plan residential or plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| review type process. Now the recode process has created these additional standards under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| the site plan that allows more for an intensive site plan review. With that, we hopefully request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| that you will follow the staff recommendation and vote to recommend the approval of the R and 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| zoning. Thank you, Mr. Forrester. We have a number of individuals have signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1879)|
| 0:31:29| on this topic. Item number 10, showing Jennifer Borth, Nick Jackson, Ernest Husk, Lacey Husk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1889)|
| 0:31:40| Jewel Westfalen, Lisa and Cindy Johnson, Christine Martin. I mean, I could go on all day long here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1900)|
| 0:31:49| For those opposed, could they go ahead and log in as an attendee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1909)|
| 0:31:59| Yes, they have been promoted to a panelist. They should be able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| Peter, do you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Have the option to turn on their video if they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Okay. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Excuse me, Commissioner Phillips, I hate to interrupt you, but could we allow five more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| minutes for, since we have a large volume of speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| So you want a lot of additional, I mean, a total of 10 minutes for the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Yes, please. And then, of course, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| Mr. Forrester as well. Thank you. We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Commissioner Korbelik, you have your hand raised too. Would you like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| before the opposition speaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| I just have a couple of questions to the applicant, which I can ask now or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| If you don't mind, Commissioner, let's wait until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| other panelists have the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| Mr. Jackson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| Yes. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Okay. Mine is probably about five minutes. So if anybody wants to go after me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| I've tried to whittle it down, but I can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| We'll need your name and number. And if you open your video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| we'll be able to see you too, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Okay. Yeah, I'm good. My name is Nick Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| I live in St. Andrews neighborhood at 8270 Glen Ross Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| I'm speaking on behalf of the board of the St. Andrews Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| and its residents. We are opposed to the requested rezoning of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| which is adjacent to our neighborhood and the Jean T. Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| We ask you to deny the requested rezoning from Office Park to RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| We do support the development of this property under its existing Office Park zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| Office zoning is a reasonable use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| The impact of an office on single family homes is much less than the impact from apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| Office activity is during the work week, not on nights or weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| That means less noise on evenings and weekends when residents are home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| In January 2005, this property was rezoned from planned residential to Office 1 at the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| of Mr. Oliver Smith, the owner of the parcel and the developer of St. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| The staff comment and support stated the proposed Office Park use for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| will provide a compatible use transition between residential uses and the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| The one-year plan was amended from medium density residential to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| Both were done with the express support of St. Andrews neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| and the West Hills Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Mr. Smith presented plans for offices and needed to rezone the property in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| build them or to sell it. Mr. Smith told the neighborhood that an apartment complex on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| property was not in the best interest of St. Andrews neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| 15 years later, nothing has changed in our neighborhood and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| Yet Mr. Smith has decided it's appropriate to build a large amount of apartments just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| because he's lined up a potential buyer for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| A large apartment complex is not compatible in close proximity to single family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| just feet away from existing homeowners' backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| We all know that the minimal landscaping and 10-foot buffer requirements cannot effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| overcome the negative impacts of an inappropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Commissioners have read many comments from our residents, and I'll review the major reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| why rezoning this property to RN5, a medium density residential neighborhood, is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| It is of great concern that any plans or drawings submitted with the application are not binding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| If this rezoning is approved, it will not come back to the Planning Commission or any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| other public body for further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| There will be no more public meetings regarding this development or its impact on St. Andrews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| and a larger West Hills neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| We are very concerned by the prospect of RN5 zoning, which allows up to 400 plus apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| on this narrow parcel of land with no public review before a public body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| When the one-year plan and sector plan were amended from office to medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| slash office in 2015, the planned residential zoning district was part of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| It required use on review approval of the development plan for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| Unfortunately, the planned residential zoning district no longer exists in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| Developing this property with apartments but without public review wasn't contemplated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| The city's zoning ordinance sets out very specific standards, all of which must be met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| in order for a rezoning request to be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| For example, the proposed amendment shall be necessary because of substantially changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| or changing conditions in the area and districts affected or in the city generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| The professional planning staff comments state there have been no recent significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| changes in this area that would prompt a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| Just based on the failure to meet this mandatory standard, how can this rezoning be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| Nothing has changed with the adjacent and nearby single family houses to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| and St. Andrews and hundreds of additional West Hills homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| The West Hills Baptist Church property is adjacent to and east of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| The West Hills Park is across Winston Road and further to the east is West Hills Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| The West End Church of Christ is to the west of the property and to the south of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| is still entirely bordered by I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| Another mandatory standard states the proposed amendment shall not adversely affect any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| part of the city, nor shall any direct or indirect adverse effects result from such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| This rezoning would adversely affect the St. Andrews neighborhood with additional flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| issues, additional noise, additional lighting from the apartments, additional students for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| already overcrowded schools, additional traffic to a very dangerous North Gallaher View Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| and negatively affecting the value of homes if the neighborhood is perceived as less desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| The 2019 one-year plan, Chapter 2, states under each of the 31 general land use categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| is a range of permitted zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| The Planning Commission and the City Council have the option to further limit these ranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| for particular properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| The Planning Commission and City Council are obligated to recommend and approve the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| zoning district within the conforming range for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| R and 5 is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Excuse me, Mr. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Mr. Jackson, you need to conclude your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| I've got about, yeah, just five seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| I'm done, but I can close right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| So R and 5 is not appropriate, and zoning should remain OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| Office uses are much more compatible, and I thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| Thank you, Mr. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Are there others who desire to speak in opposition to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2336)|
| 0:39:08| Several people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| Yes, thank you, Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Yes, Michael Boer, 8330 Glen Ross Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| I wanted to say that I realize it may not be one of the primary considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| but observing your meeting on Tuesday, I noted a number of individuals state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2373)|
| 0:39:43| the Greenway would not be removed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| And Mr. Forrester is a lawyer, so I'm certain that he's taking that in the very literal sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2387)|
| 0:39:55| that they will not jackhammer up the 10-foot-wide Greenway between Wesley and the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2395)|
| 0:40:05| But I would encourage you to consider the difference between walking down that Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| flanked by a woodland area and walking down that Greenway flanked by nothing but buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2410)|
| 0:40:19| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2419)|
| 0:40:19| There is a reason that a number of people make use of this Greenway who don't live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2419)|
| 0:40:27| by pulling up at the West End Church of Christ there and joining the Greenway right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| and they head east through those woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| They do not head, if you would scan to the west just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2436)|
| 0:40:44| people do not choose, nowhere nearly as many people choose to walk down the Greenway segment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2444)|
| 0:40:55| that winds in front of the apartments to the west of the church all the way up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2455)|
| 0:41:05| to the road to Gallaher View and up Gallaher View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| It's nowhere near as pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| So as far as community usage goes, I would urge you to consider the fact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| yes, nobody's going to jackhammer up the Greenway that runs behind our houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| but they're going to make it much less pleasing in terms of usage to the broader public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2485)|
| 0:41:34| And I yield the remainder of our time to anyone else who would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2494)|
| 0:41:47| Mr. and Ms. Husk, are you available to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Jake? Wes Fallon? Johnson? Martins? Traynor? Jennings? Welsh? Barlow? Rader? Zenson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2509)|
| 0:42:15| Katrina Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| If I might add one thing, Commissioner Phillips, I might say we were under the impression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| obviously, we're not experts in PC, but part of the reason these people signed up and may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| here now is that we were under the impression we would be forced to only have one representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| even though there's hundreds of us that are very much in opposition. And I think Mr. Borth and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2558)|
| 0:42:46| are just the ones that are here and probably, you know, most familiar with Zoom and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| but that may be why they're not here, sir, I was going to say. Internally, we've discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| and some of them may have turned away from it. Thank you, Mr. Jackson, for bringing that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| our attention. I think most of the Commission received numerous emails on this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| item. So I think they're well advised of the opposition. Is there anybody else would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2589)|
| 0:43:17| speak in opposition to this before I turn it back over to Mr. Forrester for concluding comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2597)|
| 0:43:28| Also, I'd like at this time, I'd like to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| Chris Howley with the City Engineering Department. Chris, are you available to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| All right. Mr. Forrester, if you would like, you've got five minutes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2619)|
| 0:43:50| summarize your position. Certainly. Hopefully, I will not use all of that or need anywhere near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| that. I mainly just want to respond to some of the comments in regards to there potentially being up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| to 437 units. That's just based on the sheer size of the site. There will be nowhere near that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2645)|
| 0:44:13| We are looking at currently what everything has been based off of is 216 units. The traffic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2653)|
| 0:44:22| study that's already been performed and prepared is based on 216 units. The design, rendering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| site layout that's been provided, it's not set, that exact layout isn't set in stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| those are preliminary, but everything is based on 216 units. And frankly, my understanding in talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| with our professionals, our engineering architects is that that probably is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| what this site can support to do a proper development with proper landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| the proper buffering, as well as the height requirements. Again, I want to point the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| difference, a key difference in the Office Park and the RN-5 is the height limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| Office Park allows up to 50 feet as the maximum height. The RN-5 is 35. Again, height obviously is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2707)|
| 0:45:18| something that is very imposing on neighborhoods and obviously a shorter maximum height or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| more restrictive maximum height is going to be a great deal better. We intend and 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| expect to keep the discussion channel open with the residents of St. Andrews and West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| during the planning stage if the rezoning is approved and site plan review about landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| We've already engaged a landscape architect to work with on this site. We've engaged a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2748)|
| 0:45:56| forester arborist to work on retaining as many of these good healthy trees as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| Again, working with unlimited, a number of professionals to have the least amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| impact on the surrounding properties. Again, trying to have the most buffer and we'll work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| on having the most buffer away from the property lines and away from the greenways. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| Thank you, Mr. Forrester. Ms. Butler, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| Yes, I am, but I'm actually here to speak on opposing agenda item 15. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| That's all right. Aaron Klein, would you like to speak on behalf of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2798)|
| 0:46:50| Aaron Klein?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| Yes. Sorry about that. That's all right. I was just going to let you know that I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2817)|
| 0:47:05| in the meeting in lieu of Chris Howley. All right. Would you like to address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| commission and public regarding aspects of this project that affects the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2830)|
| 0:47:20| I can. I think one of the main concerns they brought up was, I think, the stormwater concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2840)|
| 0:47:30| And our understanding is there was a previous design for this subdivision where that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2850)|
| 0:47:38| approved that they were going to discharge into an injection well, essentially eliminating surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2858)|
| 0:47:47| runoff from the new development. And I believe our understanding is that this new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2867)|
| 0:47:55| would be held to that same standard. There's not going to be any modification to the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| pond on the site. Okay. I'll leave it at that for now. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair. A couple of questions for Mr. Forrester, and then I want to come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| a question for city engineering just based on that injection well. Mr. Forrester, did I hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| you correctly that you said that the land was donated by your client for the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| that's currently on the property? Yes, that's correct. And you're making the guarantee on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| behalf of your client that the greenway will remain undisturbed through all of the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| and everything of this property, correct? Correct. No disturbance, no attempts to relocate or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| of that nature. All right. The other thing, based on a comment that was made that this had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| been rezoned in 2005, is your client's request coming to us based on changing economic conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| which is why they're going from office back to R&5 to put residential instead of office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| Correct. I'm glad you brought that up. I meant to address that previously. In response to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| of the change conditions in the area, and it's not limited to the area, it's also within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| those could be market changes. There is absolutely no market in today's standards for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| office park, or even hotels, which are also permitted in office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| My clients and experts and different brokers and commercial real estate individuals tell me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| the foreseeable future on that is not very hopeful and is, in fact, quite bleak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| Okay. And this is for the city engineering. Can you explain, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| sorry, injection well is the first time I've heard this, so can you kind of explain what an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| injection well is, how it's maintained, and how that affects any development that may be on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| property? Can that injection well handle the additional runoff and kind of explain a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| bit more about that? Yes. As far as I understand, I believe it has already been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3007)|
| 0:50:17| when it was previously approved, I believe it was already installed. It's essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| something that is dug for retention purposes, and it's a state permit that they had to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| for it. And water is discharged to it and essentially is discharged into the groundwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3032)|
| 0:50:41| so it's not surface runoff. Who is responsible for maintaining that currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3041)|
| 0:50:50| It'd be the property owner. And has that been maintained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| That I don't know. I think that would, that probably would be something that would come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3056)|
| 0:51:04| during, I'll say, the permit review. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Chair recognizes Commissioner Dick Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| Thank you. In looking at this, it seems to me that Office Park is the right zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3076)|
| 0:51:24| for this piece of property. It's much less invasive than the apartments would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3084)|
| 0:51:33| And regardless of the greenway, it's going to be exposed anyway. There's not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3093)|
| 0:51:46| 50 feet of trees on, no matter what you do with this property. So just the fact that it won't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| disturbed is a good thing, but it will be opened up. It won't be the same as it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| no matter what they do. But I think that office is what belongs there. It's what the people bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3119)|
| 0:52:08| into, to begin with, in St. Ives, and that's what I would be in favor of. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3128)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Korolek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| Yes, I had three questions for the applicant's agent. The first question is, have you met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3140)|
| 0:52:29| the neighborhood? Yes, we began meeting with the neighborhood, or a client did, in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3149)|
| 0:52:39| Okay. My second question is, when you say that there will be no destruction or impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| or impact to the greenway, I think what you're saying is that you won't actually do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| any intrusions into the easement itself. That's correct. That's correct, yes. Okay. So you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3172)|
| 0:53:00| not talking about the aesthetics of the greenway. You're just talking that you won't actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3180)|
| 0:53:11| intrude into the greenway. Is that correct? I guess, if I'm following you correct, yes. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3191)|
| 0:53:19| the greenway and the buffer easements resulting from the greenway, yes. Okay. And my last question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| is, I notice the parking lot is quite close. I'd like to know what that distance is and if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| an elevation change between the parking lot finish grade and the trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3213)|
| 0:53:43| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| Based on these renderings, the closest would be 10 to 15 feet maybe, but again, these are just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| initial renderings, nothing set in stone as to the exact layout. Again, the hope is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| develop this in conjunction with the discussions with the neighborhood and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| Hedstrom Landscape Architect and work on making this. Then I had just the one question for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3251)|
| 0:54:20| representative of the neighborhood. Sure. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Thank you. Apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| they're having meetings with the neighborhood. Does the neighborhood feel that the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| has listened and made any adjustments to the design? No. I would say, actually, I was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| to chime in just to Mr. Forrester was not there. I don't think, I think he corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| I was at that meeting. I think there were maybe five of us or six. It was not the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| neighborhood. It was only the board. It was a very brief meeting, Mr. Smith and his, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3290)|
| 0:54:59| the developer's representative. It's important to probably note here, Mr. Smith, as soon as he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| sells this property, he's gone. He will not be involved in any way, shape or form. He has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| outfit, I think, in Kentucky that he built as good people that would, this continued talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3309)|
| 0:55:16| they're going to work with us. We asked about 100 questions. He left, didn't answer any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| And then he sent a really extremely brief email response and didn't answer a single one either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| It was basically the same thing, like I think Mr. Forrester was saying, we'll work with you. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| we'll figure that out together. But there's no requirement on them to do any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| As soon as it's zoned, it will be just like the meeting we had in that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| You know, it was 30 minutes. And we, as a neighborhood, felt that none of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| concerns were addressed there. We've got a long history, and we don't feel that he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| been a good actor to St. Andrews. Thank you, Mr. Jackson. Any other questions, Ms. Korbelick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| Just real quick observation. My sentiment is that either this should go as PR so that there's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| interplay in the design, or it should remain office. Commissioner, PR is not appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| inside the city. That's a county designation. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| Hey, thanks. I just have a couple of questions. Number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| can someone tell me how wide the greenway buffer is total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3386)|
| 0:56:41| I think the easement is 20 feet. Okay. As I look at it, it appears that the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| will separate the residents' neighborhood from the activity of the construction and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| the development of the apartments or office buildings, whatever. It appears to follow kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| of the northern common boundary with the neighborhood. So, how does that play into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| when you have setbacks along the common property line with the neighborhood? Is there a setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| that's additional to the greenway? Does anybody know in RN-5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3429)|
| 0:57:21| Liz, are you available to address Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| Yes. Hang on just one second. Can I share my screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3451)|
| 0:57:45| Let's see. There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| Okay. This is a list of uses. Liz, could you speak up a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3467)|
| 0:57:57| louder, please, or turn your mic up? Yes. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| That's much better. Thank you so much. Okay. So, I wanted to point out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| landscape requirements from the zoning ordinance that would apply to any non-residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3488)|
| 0:58:15| adjacent to a residential district, as well as any parking lot area for multifamily adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3495)|
| 0:58:24| RN-3, RN-2, RN-1, or the EN residential district. These images are the types of buffers that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3504)|
| 0:58:33| be required. A type B buffer would be required for non-residential. So, say if someone were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3513)|
| 0:58:42| come in right now and want to, you know, apply for construction of a hotel at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3522)|
| 0:58:52| which they could under the current OP zoning, they would be required to put in this class B buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| between this property and the adjacent residential property. If there were a rezoning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3539)|
| 0:59:09| they chose to do apartments or residential at this location, if it's multifamily, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3549)|
| 0:59:18| be required to put in this class A buffer between the adjacent residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3558)|
| 0:59:28| and the multifamily property. So, these buffer yards are required and they can be within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3568)|
| 0:59:40| rear inside yards. So, they can be within those setbacks, but they have to be landscaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3580)|
| 0:59:47| Okay. So, what I'm understanding is the greenway kind of follows that common boundary with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3587)|
| 0:59:56| neighborhood. So, in addition to the buffer that the greenway has, they will have an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| class A buffer if the apartments are built. Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| So, the buffer will have to be in there whether or not, I would probably need to defer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| city as far as implementation of this section and administration and if they would consider the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3614)|
| 1:00:23| greenway as part of that. I mean, I think the greenway can be there, but they're still going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| have to provide that vegetation in that area. Okay. And the last point I was just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| make sure I'm clear on, the sector plan for this property currently allows R and 5 apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| because they're not asking for a sector plan change. So, this is an acceptable use of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| property from a sector plan perspective, right? Yes. The MDRO slash office designation allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| consideration of R and 5 and R and 6. That's all I had. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3655)|
| 1:01:04| Liz, what would be the height limitation for Office Park? Let me go to that. So, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3664)|
| 1:01:14| existing zoning OP, the maximum building height is 50 feet. In the recommended zone that staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| is recommending R and 5, the maximum building height is 35 feet. And in the requested zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3681)|
| 1:01:28| by the applicant, R and 6, the maximum building height is 65 feet. Okay. And uses in Office Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3688)|
| 1:01:36| you mentioned a hotel. Is that correct? Yes. Let me go to this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3696)|
| 1:01:45| Here we have, again, the existing zone of Office Park. You see the principal uses listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3705)|
| 1:01:53| A P means it is a permitted use, so it's a use by right. An S next to the use means it's a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3713)|
| 1:02:00| use. So, that would come through, you know, what we previously used to call the use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| process in the city, but it's now called special use. This is what it looks like for R and 5 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3727)|
| 1:02:14| R and 6. They have very similar permitted uses as well as special uses. And you can see, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3734)|
| 1:02:26| that, you know, things like hotels, offices, parking structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| public safety facilities are permitted uses in the Office Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3753)|
| 1:02:41| zone district. Is there a halfway house in there, too? That's just what we need, another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| halfway house zone. So, that is permitted as a special use in all three zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3766)|
| 1:02:54| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3774)|
| 1:03:08| Liz, you want to remove your screen share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| All right. Chair, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3792)|
| 1:03:29| And I've got my hand raised. I just want a couple of comments. And I've listened to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| opposition and I've listened to the proponents of this. And quite frankly, I think things change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| over time. You know, you mentioned 15 years ago when it was rezoned before. There was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| intent to build office there, but obviously, there's not a market for that. And I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| greenway is staying intact. And I think that with the sector plan allowing this R and 5 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| I'd like to make a motion we approve R and 5 per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| I'll second. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| I, Chair, will recognize Commissioner Kowalik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| Yes. I was waiting to hear from staff regarding whether the zone buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| are measured from the property line or from the greenway easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| This is Liz. They'll be measured from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3867)|
| 1:04:39| So there is no setback or additional buffer required from the easement, the greenway easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| since it is on the inside of the property line. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| So it's my understanding that there are no buffers required for any greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3891)|
| 1:04:59| throughout the City of Knoxville. There's no landscaping requirement called out in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3899)|
| 1:05:07| in the zoning ordinance, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| Yes, and the buffer that was described would be measured from the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| which would, in essence, be the greenway itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3917)|
| 1:05:25| They would still have to accommodate the planting. So whether they do it on the north or south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| of the greenway, you know, I think is probably up to the design professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3932)|
| 1:05:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| Thank you. We have a motion by Commissioner Ross, seconded by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=3947)|

| 1:07:53| that wanted the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4073)|

| 1:09:52| As you may recall, back in August, this applicant, W.C. Woodbury, came before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| for this piece of property, and there was a proposed use on review for a multi-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| development of approximately 80 apartment units. There was a lot of opposition, a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| before this board, and ultimately, this commission voted to deny that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| The client went back, looked at the site, continued to work with its engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| and has come back before you with a single-family detached residential development. As you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4227)|
| 1:10:37| that meeting, there was a lot of discussion that apartments were not appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| but that single family was appropriate, and there was a lot of discussion on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| on the Edwards Place subdivision being supportive of detached single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4245)|
| 1:10:53| If you've been out to this site, it is, I've visited it, it's a challenging site, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4253)|
| 1:11:01| as you can see from this development plan and concept plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| tried to use the best portion of this property to control the impact and leave as much of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4266)|
| 1:11:14| property undeveloped and undisturbed. In fact, it's approximately 30 acres, and my estimate is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| approximately one-third of the property will remain undeveloped and undisturbed, and importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| the Beaver Creek storm buffer area and the forested area on the south side of Beaver Creek there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4288)|
| 1:11:37| Mr. Reynolds, in the staff report, has noted that actually the density that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| is proposed with this 80-unit development is substantially less than what was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4304)|
| 1:11:52| in a previously now expired concept development plan. I think it's important to note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4312)|
| 1:12:03| this development does incorporate sidewalks and incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| sidewalk connections with the recently approved development on the east side of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4329)|
| 1:12:18| Similar to the previous proposal when we were here in August, that area to the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4338)|
| 1:12:26| there, Beaver Creek, that will remain undeveloped and undisturbed. The applicant is agreeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| to permanently ease that, put a conservation type easement on that to avoid anybody from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4352)|
| 1:12:41| any future development on that, that would run with the land and it would remain undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| and undisturbed. We submit that this development is in harmony with the intent and purposes of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4367)|
| 1:12:54| Knox County Zoning Ordinance. It meets the use on review approval requirements for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4374)|
| 1:13:01| planned development or planned residential. Also important to note that if you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| several houses in the Edwards Place subdivision have experienced inadequate sewer utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4388)|
| 1:13:18| as a result of the, I believe it's a pump type station that was installed incorrectly or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| that it's just inadequate in itself to serve that. With this development, the applicant will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| installing a proper and adequate pump station, not only to serve this, but to also serve those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4409)|
| 1:13:39| residents and those properties in the Edwards Place subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| With that, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| All right. Chair recognizes either Mr. Murphy or Mr. Caldwell. Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4427)|
| 1:13:56| Thank you. We'd actually like Mr. Caldwell to go first and then Ms. Katrina Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| That's fine. Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4443)|
| 1:14:12| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| I don't see Mr. Caldwell's name on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| Mr. Murphy, if you don't go ahead and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| I see Ms. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| I'm sorry, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Ms. Butler is still on if she wants to unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| Okay, yes, I can go ahead and speak. My name is Katrina Butler and my address is 7705 Longshanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4472)|
| 1:14:39| Road. When the Planning Commission approved the original plan for Edwards Place over 13 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| the vision of Edwards Place was created and has continued to develop since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| Though we have been through a few different developers, that vision has remained the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| Edwards Place residents have done our due diligence in reaching out to this developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| but their lack of response to any of our questions is very telling of the level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| of interest they have in working with us to continue a cohesive community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| Are you confident a positive outcome is possible for this community when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| this developer is already unresponsive to the questions asked by the existing residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| If this gives you pause, this plan should not be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| As the developer would not provide answers to our questions we ask, we request that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| ask the developer some of our questions today. We have other developers who have expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| interest in completing our neighborhood. Through our communication, we know these developers share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4530)|
| 1:15:38| the same vision for Edwards Place. We are an engaged community of neighbors who have a strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| interest in working in conjunction with the developer to ensure our neighborhood's original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| plan is fully implemented. If you approve this plan today, we will be stepping away from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| original plan, the vision, in order to deviate towards something not carefully considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| or planned out. And this will also strip Edwards Place residents of any opportunity to bring the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| final part of the original plan to fruition. When taken at face value, you see single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| We, whose everyday lives will be impacted by this plan, see more than that. We see the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| Two separate HOAs where Woodbury Crossing would have no responsibility for assisting and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| of Edwards Place entrance and common areas, despite reaping the benefits of Edwards Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| serving as its sole means of transportation in and out of Woodbury Crossing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| A subdivision within a subdivision, having separate names, creates division instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| a cohesive neighborhood, as originally planned. Not to mention the confusion in where one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| neighborhood ends and one begins, and without any landscaping or lighting. This piecemealed approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| is a far cry from a planned vision. This developer's concept plan has smaller lots than Edwards Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| which is incompatible with the character of the neighborhood. We request that you uphold the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| original character of the neighborhood. As this plan does not offer amenities like a recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| field or clubhouse, this plan will eliminate any possibility for Edwards Place residents to ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| have the amenity area in the planning commission required as condition number two on the very first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| use on review. We will never have the opportunity to build a pool, playground, clubhouse, or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| else. Our vision will be cut off because of an afterthought to stick another subdivision within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| ours just for the sake of development. With so many unknowns involving this plan, it sets up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| the residents of Edwards Place to be left on the losing end. Development needs to be planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| cohesive, consistent, and transparent. This plan is none of those things. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4654)|
| 1:17:41| Thank you very much, Ms. Poehler. Mr. Murphy. Thank you. I believe Mr. Caldwell is now back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4661)|
| 1:17:48| All right. Now, you've got a minute left, minute four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| Okay. Mr. Caldwell, if you'd like to speak, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| Okay. I guess Mr. Caldwell hasn't joined back up. Okay. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| This development has been, you know, it's been going on since 2007, since the original concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| plans. A couple of the key points that we think are really important to understand is, one, every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| other concept plan before this has had a single homeowners association, and it had an open area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4696)|
| 1:18:22| where there were supposed to be some amenities, either a clubhouse, a pool, or something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| that. This new plan that's been presented to you takes all that away. So what you're really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| you know, if you approve this, you're letting the development off the hook for what was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| promised to the planning commission. And the planning commission originally actually required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| that common area that, you know, had some sort of, you know, recreational uses attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| So you're actually letting them, you're letting the development off the hook for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| Also, I think this is a really unique one where we've got two different HOAs that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| established. Perhaps, you know, if this was to go through, you would need to have a condition that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| it actually, that you join the existing HOA or something. That's, you know, it's tough to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| with this because we've been going around with this for, you know, several developers and builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| and such. And finally, I would ask if there, you know, if this is approved to put a condition on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4753)|
| 1:19:20| the final plat that would be marked as, you know, not to be further developed. That's a promise the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| applicant has made. I think they said a conservation easement, but, you know, at least something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| indicating on the plat that would be a good condition. But, you know, really this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| this is less than what the last, you know, the original concept plan and the re-approvals of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| that had. So, I think, you know, the residents are justified in feeling like they're being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| taken away from what they originally promised. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Mr. Forrester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| you still have a minute and four seconds left. Mr. Murphy, you still have 17 seconds if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| anything else that you'd like to add. I guess in response to some of the, I guess, the comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4798)|
| 1:20:07| the recreational area, obviously, I wasn't involved in that previous plan, but that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| hasn't expired. And I believe that was part of the entirety of this at that time with the much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4813)|
| 1:20:22| higher density, but also that requirement was attached to there being a total of 100 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4822)|
| 1:20:33| however many total units that a much higher density was going to require that, which we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4833)|
| 1:20:41| not have here. Again, we are preserving a large area of green space that is going to remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4841)|
| 1:20:48| undisturbed. The, I guess my client is on the Zoom that they could possibly respond or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4848)|
| 1:20:59| engineers as well if they have any comments. All right. Chair will recognize Ms. Katrina Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4859)|
| 1:21:16| You have 17 seconds. You might need to split that between you and Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| I just wanted to add that as the residents in Edwards Place, when we bought our homes years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| ago, we had the vision of our subdivision being completed as a whole. And that's not what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| plan calls for. It calls for another subdivision kind of being built within our subdivision. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| not what we bought into for our families. And I just wanted to add that. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4899)|
| 1:21:48| No other comments, commission? Any comments from commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| Chair will recognize Commissioner Dent. Yes, this is a question for staff. Would this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4913)|
| 1:22:04| developer have any obligation to fulfill any requirements for Edwards Place? Would this be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4924)|
| 1:22:13| considered an entire subdivision or should this be treated as an entirely separate subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| from Edwards Place? This is Mike Reynolds with Knox County Planning. It can be either. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4939)|
| 1:22:27| it could either be considered as part of the original Edwards, as a future, as the next phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| of the Edwards Place, or it could be its own separate subdivision that this happens to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| access through the Edwards Place subdivision. Okay. I have a couple other questions for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4960)|
| 1:22:51| applicant. With this being a use on review, I think whether this is rentals or owned does come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| into play. I can't imagine they're rentals, but I would like to ask the applicant, are these single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| family units to be sold or rented? Taylor Forrester. Again, as to the current plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4984)|
| 1:23:18| the final end result is not known for sure, but my client, their experience in all areas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=4998)|
| 1:23:26| real estate, all areas of residential real estate, they have a long history in single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| at multifamily, and I can, Mr. Tom Simons with WC Woodbury is also on the Zoom call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5012)|
| 1:23:44| I'd probably turn that over to him at this time. Okay. Well, my last question is, would the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5024)|
| 1:23:59| applicant be willing to add to the plot that the rest of the area would not be developed? I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5039)|
| 1:24:09| that they're committed to that, but are they willing to plot that for a permanent record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| Absolutely. I'm online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5054)|
| 1:24:22| Are you the applicant, sir? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5062)|
| 1:24:32| Okay. Could you answer for me whether these single family dwellings are to be rented or owned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5072)|
| 1:24:41| Commissioner, if I could interject, whether they're rental or owned or occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5081)|
| 1:24:48| it should not be a consideration from this commission in terms of reviewing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| This is use on review, not a rezoning, correct? Whether it's rezoning or anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5094)|
| 1:25:02| in terms of whether it's single family or rental should not be a consideration by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| Someone explain why to me, please. The Fair Housing Act is what comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5108)|
| 1:25:18| Go ahead, Commissioner Dent. I just wanted to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| Yeah. Yeah. I was asking, I don't quite understand why that isn't important, because if it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5123)|
| 1:25:30| you know, multifamily, we would know it's a rental versus single family. And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| if these are apartment complexes, then the fact that those are rentals versus being owned would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| come into play. So I don't know why in a single family that wouldn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| Well, anybody in phase one can rent their house if they want. I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| That's a good point. That is a good point. I don't know that they would all end up being rented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| but I don't know. I just wanted to ask and see if the applicant would answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| I do think that you run into the Fair Housing Act, which is a legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| vehicle, and it prevents people from making decisions based on a number of factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5173)|
| 1:26:22| including renting versus home ownership. Sure. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| I see. Could be prejudicial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| Thank you. I just wanted to make a couple of quick points. I voted against the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5193)|
| 1:26:44| last time because I felt like it was not the right thing to do to have apartments in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| back of a subdivision. And I feel like this is kind of what we told the applicant we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| see. And I can't think of a reason why you could deny single family that is very similar to what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5217)|
| 1:27:06| in phase one. I think it's pretty clear that this has always been an addition to the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| part of the neighborhood. The roads were teed in back there. And so I'm inclined to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5231)|
| 1:27:21| at least on the variance portion of things, if that's if it's the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| I can make a motion that we approve variance one because the site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| with the subdivision regulations and proposed variance will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| Thank you. Before we go to vote, I want to recognize Commissioner Kraft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5257)|
| 1:27:45| Yes, I think that the fact that these are going to be rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5265)|
| 1:27:55| they haven't said that they're not going to be rentals. So I would assume that they are. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5275)|
| 1:28:03| a whole rental project isn't much different from apartments back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5283)|
| 1:28:11| And I would say that it is very important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5291)|
| 1:28:21| renters do not have the same interest in their property as people that own their own homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5301)|
| 1:28:30| And for that reason, I think that it should be considered very carefully that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5310)|
| 1:28:40| what we're looking at isn't a whole lot different from what we looked at last time and voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5320)|
| 1:28:48| There's a little separation between the houses, but it poses the same problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5328)|
| 1:28:56| for the people in Edwards. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Depp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5336)|
| 1:29:03| Okay. Yes. I can understand what Commissioner Korpelik was saying about the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5343)|
| 1:29:11| So, you know, that does make sense to me. Commissioner Smith, would you be willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| amend your motion to include that they would plat the rest of that area to not be developed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| future? Well, I think there's two more motions after. The one I made was just for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| So, I think we could do that in one of the later motions. That's okay. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5370)|
| 1:29:37| Anything else, Commissioner Denton? All right. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5377)|
| 1:29:44| Yes. I just wanted to concur with Commissioner Graf and that there are changes to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5384)|
| 1:29:53| Commissioner Smith was saying that we'd gotten what we'd asked for, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| the there being two HOAs now is a difference. And the fact that there is no common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5396)|
| 1:30:06| is a difference. And I think that those are qualitative things about this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| that should be considered. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Heddy-Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5412)|
| 1:30:20| So, a quick question. Did the original HOA include the land that is now being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| considered under this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| Does it have controlling interest over this property in the original HOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| This is Taylor Forrest. I can answer that. It does not. This property is not attached to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| declaration of covenants and restrictions. Okay. So, while everybody keeps saying this is two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| HOAs and one HOA, it's really two HOAs and two separate pieces of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| no different than two developments sitting side by side, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| Yes, correct. Thank you. Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5455)|
| 1:31:06| Thank you. I feel like as a commissioner, whether it's a part of the same HOA or not part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| same HOA, and also whether it's rental or whether it's an owned home, I don't feel like those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| things that I should take into consideration. What I do see that I think I should take into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| consideration is the fact that they have designated 16.42 acres as common space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| I support Commissioner Dent's suggestion that we go ahead and strengthen that working from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5493)|
| 1:31:40| common space to something that will be undeveloped. I think that is a great asset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| especially between the school and the creek. I think that's a wonderful asset for us. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| I do think that this is an improvement over what we saw last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| All right. Thank you, Commissioner. Does everybody, I mean, I've got other hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5515)|
| 1:32:03| Commissioner Smith, Eddie Smith, have you lowered your hand or you have something else you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| say? Well, the only reason, and I just want to respond to Commissioner Eason, the reason I ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| that question is based on looking at all the conditions, especially around number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| where it talks about working with to provide Knox County Engineering for review during phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| Phase one was under one HOA. This is a different one. So, that's why I just want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| that phase one did not include any of this land. Because again, if it didn't, it has to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| of our thought process. If it did, then I think we have to think about what did the people before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| us agree to when we're making our decision. But that's why I was asking that question. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| I wanted to make sure that we were clear that these are two separate things when I was asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| that question. So, I agree with you. And I agree with, you know, Commissioner Denton. I'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| supporting her recommendation on the next one. But I just say we go ahead and move forward if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| no one else has questions. Commissioner Adams. Yes. Am I wrong in that this new development is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5576)|
| 1:33:07| going to be using the roads from the original development? Isn't that correct? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5587)|
| 1:33:16| And they're public roads, county roads. All right. So, we have a motion by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5596)|
| 1:33:29| Scott Smith, seconded by Commissioner Roth to approve variance one for the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| Call the roll, please, Ms. Karen. Yes. Commissioner Utman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| Yes. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| Yes. Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| Yes. Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| Yes. Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Yes. Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| Yes. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| I'm voting no, but also want to make sure that Commissioner Phillips is aware that someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| has been asking if they can speak. It looks like it is one of the panelists who may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| part of the opposition, or I'm just saying someone's trying to speak. I recognize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5650)|
| 1:34:17| Commissioner Adams, and right now the discussion is with the Commission, and we have a vote on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| floor. Continue, Ms. Karen. Yes, sir. Thank you. Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5662)|
| 1:34:29| Yes. Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| Yes. Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| No. Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Yes. Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| Yes. Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| Yes. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| Yes. Twelve ayes and two nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5692)|
| 1:35:00| All right. Is there a motion on the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5700)|
| 1:35:07| Or discussion? I'd like to motion to approve the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| plan with the 13 conditions recommended by staff and a 14th condition that the land south of Beaver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5711)|
| 1:35:21| Creek be designated a conservation area. We have a motion. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5721)|
| 1:35:29| Second. Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| Yes. Go ahead, Commissioner Smith. Okay. When you say designated a conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5732)|
| 1:35:41| area, you know, that's going to, I think we'd be better if we called it common area, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5741)|
| 1:35:48| or because they're going to, that means they're going to have to go and get someone to take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| over. Is that, I mean, conservation, putting in land into a conservation area means someone has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5752)|
| 1:36:00| to be willing to take it and it's a conservancy. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| That's correct. Do we need to think through how that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| the easiest way to accomplish the same goal? Is there a better way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| Can we say undeveloped open space? Common area, maybe, would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5773)|
| 1:36:22| I think it's already been discussed on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| Could it be plotted? On that question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| Mike, do you want to respond to the comments? I'm not sure the best way to handle it. You could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5791)|
| 1:36:43| definitely say something along the lines of undeveloped common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5803)|
| 1:36:51| Anything that does happen over there in the future would have to come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| development plan review. But I think if you want to make it simpler outside of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5814)|
| 1:37:03| conservation area, I think undeveloped common area would probably be sufficient. I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5823)|
| 1:37:11| going over there and taking down trees and that kind of thing, it's probably fairly unlikely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| No one wants to maintain something that they're not going to be using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| So, just making sure that it's some kind of undisturbed area. But obviously, we want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5839)|
| 1:37:28| it open for public use, though, too. There's a greenway there. If they could work with the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| department, the greenway goes through and there's some kind of amenity for that greenway that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| be put there, then that could be a benefit as well. Thank you, Mr. Miles. Can I make a suggestion for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| for Commissioner Korbelik to consider that we make the 14th condition say that all undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| land in this plan must remain undeveloped and as a common space. That way the must sets it in stone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5872)|
| 1:38:02| that they would have to come back and that's our it's the same as the old shall. It's just they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| use must to say that it has to stay this going forward. Commissioner Korbelik, are you agreeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| with that change? I'm agreeable to the wording, but I would like it to apply to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| south of Beaver Creek in case there's a couple of little common areas north of Beaver Creek. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| know if they want to put in a, you know, a gazebo or something. So, I would like it to apply south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| of Beaver Creek. So, south of Beaver Creek must remain as undeveloped common space. Or open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5913)|
| 1:38:41| common space, open space. Yes. Yes. Oh, undeveloped common space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5921)|
| 1:38:49| All right. And we have, who seconded that motion? I did. Jeff, Jeff, Commissioner Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5929)|
| 1:38:57| Commissioner Korbelik, Mr. Phillips, Commissioner Hill. Mr. Phillips, could I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5937)|
| 1:39:04| Trying to think through all the future possibilities and I may be raising something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| that may never happen, but what if the HOA or the residents wanted to build a, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5949)|
| 1:39:19| some type of convening space there? Should we be more careful about how we word? Does it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| necessarily have to be open space? And I don't know if we can make a condition that it's in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| hands of the HOA. I just, I want everybody to contemplate every possibility. I've had bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| experiences with these things that get put in a concept stage. Like, if a tree falls from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| area and goes over, I mean, you know, do you want to be able to maintain it? Do you want to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| grass? Just, you have to be careful what you put down here because it's hard to work around these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5986)|
| 1:39:53| things sometimes with, you know. Once you, I guess, make it open space, then doesn't that prevent it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=5993)|
| 1:40:01| from being anything that the residents could want? That's why I chose open space or common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6001)|
| 1:40:09| space. That, again, I would consider if they wanted to put a building there that was for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| community, that is a common space and would fall under what I was recommending. Well, I'm in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6014)|
| 1:40:25| motion. What are we amending it to? I think open or common space would satisfy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6025)|
| 1:40:38| Condition 14 would be that the land south of Beaver Creek remain as undeveloped common space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6038)|
| 1:40:47| So, we have a motion by Commissioner Korblick, seconded by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6047)|
| 1:40:54| to approve concept plan subject to 13 conditions with the addition of condition 14 regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6054)|
| 1:41:03| property south of Beaver Creek maintaining as undeveloped per her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6063)|
| 1:41:10| I'm sorry, Chair Phillips, I'm sorry to continue on this. And I'm probably taking it to the nth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| degree, but when you add undeveloped to it, doesn't that prevent it for any structures to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| on it? I'll amend the amendment to state with the exception of minor structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6083)|
| 1:41:38| I'm sorry. This is Commissioner Boyer. I just have a question about really defining this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| with undeveloped or minor structures. I'm not sure we're in a position to actually hem them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6104)|
| 1:41:55| that way. If we're actually giving the neighbors what they want with that piece of property or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6115)|
| 1:42:05| homeowners. So, I'm really kind of concerned about even minor structures. I mean, what if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6125)|
| 1:42:12| it's really more up to the homeowners association or to the residents? So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6132)|
| 1:42:20| I guess I still would like to vet this a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| Yeah, I think we ought to say something about no other dwelling units to be put on the common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| space. And that way, it allows the homeowners association to add amenities into their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| common area, but it restricts dwellings. Or they could come back and file a new concept if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| they wanted to build some community structure. They could put a new concept in on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6163)|
| 1:42:51| and ask permission to alter it at that point. Can we just call it common space for the subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| I think that probably covers it. Could we not say something like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6178)|
| 1:43:05| to remain undeveloped unless determined otherwise by future HOA? That way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| it's open enough to allow the HOA to determine any future things that happen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6190)|
| 1:43:18| I would like to provide a condition 14 that states that the land south of Beaver Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6198)|
| 1:43:25| shall remain as common space and shall not have any dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| Thank you. Commissioner Roth, is that suitable to your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6211)|
| 1:43:38| Yes. Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6218)|

| 1:55:10| We have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6912)|
| 1:55:13| We'd just simply like to request approval per staff recommendation with the 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6913)|

| 1:55:28| And I'd like to make a motion to approve the concept plan subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| We have a motion by Commissioner Ross, seconded by Commissioner Buston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| to approve the concept plan subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| Ms. Cairn, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| Can we have discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| Commissioner Corbett, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| I had several questions for the staff and the applicant on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| that we, if I, unless I've got my applications mixed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| I think we received a letter today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| two or three pages, I don't have it with me here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| that was going through the concerns regarding flooding and collisions along the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6968)|
| 1:56:16| And I wanted to ask the staff how the progress is coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6976)|
| 1:56:25| on the improving, providing a center lane to West Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| which is mentioned in the sector plan on page 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| It's supposed to be installed by 2029.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| And I'd like to know the status of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=6997)|
| 1:56:48| Mike Rales, would you respond to Commissioner Corbett's comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| I might need to have the county engineering department weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| and see if they have any improvements planned for this section of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7017)|
| 1:57:04| Who is here representing the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7024)|
| 1:57:12| Or rather, I guess the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| Yeah, this is Jim Snowden with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| Ms. Corbett, what section of the Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| this were you referring to in regard to the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| The sector plan mentioned it would go from Oak Ridge Highway to Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| And that there would be a center lane installed by 2029.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7053)|
| 1:57:40| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| This location here, the only improvement that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| I guess, in the conversation right now is where the cursor is there on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7070)|
| 1:57:57| There's a turn lane and signalization going to be installed at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| hopefully in the next five to seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| We're working with TDOT on that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| It's a, actually, it's a two-way stop now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| And it's a T-intersection, so it's a little bit unique configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| So we are working on securing some state funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| because two legs of that are our state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| and the western leg is a county route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| But we are working on that to install turn lanes and signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| and install a three-lane section from there to tie into the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| where our new Carnes Valley Drive is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| So that is the improvement that is currently being discussed at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7115)|
| 1:58:42| Would there be any improvement along the segment that fronts this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7128)|
| 1:58:48| That location there with the construction of the Carnes Valley Drive now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7128)|
| 1:58:53| we would think operates more as a more of a little neighborhood type roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| more so than a major collector because of the diversion of traffic onto Carnes Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| So we don't contemplate any improvements on that leg of West Emory at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7144)|
| 1:59:11| And then regarding floodwater, apparently there's flooding that occurs along Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7151)|
| 1:59:17| I read the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| I didn't see that it identified any stormwater improvements for Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| I did read about the Beaver Creek, oh, I guess it's called Green Infrastructure Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7164)|
| 1:59:32| And I was wondering, this is unfair if you haven't read that applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7172)|
| 1:59:39| the neighbor's letter that we received today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| but there is documented serious flooding along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| And I was wondering if you were aware of that, could respond to it, A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| And then B, I noticed some of the townhomes fronting West Emory are actually within the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7191)|
| 1:59:59| let me see what the phrase is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| There's a phrase I didn't quite understand on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| Within the Knox County Outer Buffer Relocation Line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7204)|
| 2:00:23| So flooding on Emory Road, and then the fact that some of the townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| intrude on that relocation buffer line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| Yeah, Commissioner Corbett, I'll answer the first part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| and then I'll ask Leo LaCambre, our hydrologist, to answer the second part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| The flooding that we were, I guess, witnessed up on West Emory near the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7238)|
| 2:00:45| during the most heavy rains was due primarily to a culvert at that location that was partially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7245)|
| 2:00:53| collapsed, kind of right there where the hand is on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| So we have since replaced that culvert with one that's, I think, maybe a little bit larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| not much larger, but one that does allow for a lot better flow of water just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| of the previous culvert had been damaged pretty significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| So we think we may have that in a better position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| As far as the buffer you're referring to, I'll let Leo LaCambre speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| He has a little more knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Yeah, they're required to have a 50-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| The first 25 feet has to be undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| The outer 25 feet can be averaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| So they'll have to keep those units out of that buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| They can't average it to go under a total with the 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7298)|
| 2:01:44| The pipe under the road is only a 48-inch pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| So they've got a 50-foot buffer to handle the flow from a 4-foot pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| So I don't anticipate there will be any problems with those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| And so the phrase, reload, let me see now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| Knox County Outer Buffer Relocation Line, what do you mean by relocation line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7324)|
| 2:02:11| It has to average 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| So I think in that area, it's actually over 50 feet to compensate for some areas where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| it may be a little bit under 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| In reading the sector plan, there was a lot of discussion from the neighborhood participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7345)|
| 2:02:32| about the need to maintain the rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| And this line of townhomes that are close together and it looks like very lightly screened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7355)|
| 2:02:43| from the road is not in keeping with the neighborhood input on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7363)|
| 2:02:49| And for that reason, I would like to probably consider denying the application or tabling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| But I think the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| There's a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| We'll call a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| I've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| Jeff, you made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| And second by Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| Call the roll, Dory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Mr. Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7410)|
| 2:03:39| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7419)|
| 2:03:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7427)|

| 2:05:24| 12 ayes and two nays, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Motion carries. Item number 19 was removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7524)|
| 2:05:31| off consent. The applicant for Hayden Farms is Hardin Valley Farm Development, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7531)|
| 2:05:38| Properties located on the northwest side of Sam Lee Road, south of Narrow Leaf Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7538)|
| 2:05:45| Applicant is seeking approval for up to nine detached residential lots, variance one and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| alternative design standards one and two. Staff recommendation approval of variance one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7551)|
| 2:05:57| and alternative design standards one through two and approval of the concept plan subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7557)|
| 2:06:03| to seven conditions. This will require two separate motions. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7563)|
| 2:06:09| Yes. Is there opposition? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7569)|
| 2:06:19| Applicant, would you like to go first? Would you like to opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| Yeah, I'll go briefly. I'm David Harbin, an engineer with Fats & Himes, Norville & Poe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| on behalf of the applicant here, Hardin Valley Farms. This is a revised concept and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7589)|
| 2:06:38| plan that we have put up here. Basically, the revision is to improve the site distance where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7598)|
| 2:06:45| the road is coming out on Sam Lee Road. We had it at the previous spot, but this area actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7605)|
| 2:06:52| improved it. We have even further or better site distance at this location here. And also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7612)|
| 2:06:58| it has the advantage of moving our development and our road away from Mr. Fairstein, who I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7618)|
| 2:07:05| will be speaking here in just a minute. And that was one of his chief concerns. We talked with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| back when this was previously approved. So we actually have some common area that abuts through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7630)|
| 2:07:17| most of his property right there. The overall development plan, if approved today, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7637)|
| 2:07:23| actually decrease our lots by one from what was previously developed. So with the added safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7643)|
| 2:07:31| and the addition of common areas, I would urge to approve per staff recommendation. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7651)|
| 2:07:39| Thank you, Mr. Harbin. Mr. Fairstein. Yes, can you hear me? Yes, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7659)|
| 2:07:47| I'm John Fairstein, 11205 Sam Lee Road, Knoxville 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7667)|
| 2:07:57| Thank you. You have up to five minutes, sir. Well, first, thanks to the commission and to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7677)|
| 2:08:02| fortitude. The first thing, I have a series of questions here, and I'd appreciate it if I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7682)|
| 2:08:11| ask the question, stop the clock, get the response, and then go on. But anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| I appreciate the movement of the entranceway. However, in the file, there's no map of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7697)|
| 2:08:29| And I had to actually go do quite a bit of work to figure out where that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7709)|
| 2:08:36| But my first question is, lots 42 and 43 extend beyond the 25-foot peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7716)|
| 2:08:47| And staff has never communicated to me about that. So let me ask that question and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7727)|
| 2:08:55| what the response is. Staff responsible, that is Mike Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7735)|
| 2:09:03| Mike, can you respond? Yes. Yeah, I was just looking up the old plan right now to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7743)|
| 2:09:08| it showed. My recollection was that those lots already extended into the peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| And that's pretty common to have a lot extend into the peripheral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7753)|
| 2:09:21| Let me see if I can get that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7761)|
| 2:09:31| Sorry, it's taking a moment. Yeah, in the first version of this plan, those lots already did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| extend into that peripheral setback. So when I was reviewing this revised plan, I did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| take that into consideration as being a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7783)|
| 2:09:51| Well, unfortunately, I didn't notice that in the first revision. So I think that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7791)|
| 2:10:00| addressed. And in a related question, number two, and Mr. Ooten had assured me of this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7800)|
| 2:10:09| that there's going to be what I would call a swale between lots 38 and 42. And I can't tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7809)|
| 2:10:19| from the diagram if that still exists. But I feel like that it does. But I'd like some confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7819)|
| 2:10:26| of that. Okay, this is David Harvin again. I can address that. Obviously, the design plan will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7826)|
| 2:10:44| the next phase that we will work with Knox County Engineering on. Part of this will be, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7844)|
| 2:10:52| we can't direct stormwater onto a neighbor. So obviously, any runoff from the back of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7852)|
| 2:10:58| houses will obviously be swaled and we'll pop that away. Actually, to the west, the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7858)|
| 2:11:07| there's a rather large pond there. That's where the runoff from the back of these lots here will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7867)|
| 2:11:13| be directed around Mr. Fairstein and into that pond. Right, I understand the pond and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7873)|
| 2:11:21| I think that's more or less acceptable, but it's the lots 38 and 42, and particularly 42,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7881)|
| 2:11:31| the very, I guess you'd call that the western corner of 42, would be in the swale. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7891)|
| 2:11:43| I don't know how the owner would feel about having a big drop off at the back of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| I certainly want the swale to continue there, so I'd ask that staff and engineering address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7909)|
| 2:11:59| issue. Well, Mr. Fairstein, I can assure you that every subdivision that was approved today will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7919)|
| 2:12:07| have swales going through their property and that will be the case here as well. So there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| different here from any other subdivision. In every subdivision we've approved, we've had lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| go over the peripheral setback. What the peripheral setback does is just a building setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| that you can't build any closer to the property line, but you can beat it as part of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7944)|
| 2:12:29| There's nothing strange there at one of them. Okay, well, in your next revision of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| if you could somehow indicate the swale and how it affects lot 42. Now, going on to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7955)|
| 2:12:47| question, and I've talked to Knox County Engineering about this, and they've kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| assured me that the widening to 20 feet of Sam Lee Road stops at the end of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7973)|
| 2:13:01| and will not impact our driveway or our water well. And they've also assured me that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7981)|
| 2:13:11| 300-foot sight line on either side of the new entrance, which I walked up there, and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7991)|
| 2:13:18| going to be able to see on the east side of Sam Lee Road, you're going to be able to see the tops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=7998)|
| 2:13:26| of cars at 300 feet. And I'm not an expert on that, so I'll accept that, but I want to get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8006)|
| 2:13:36| assurance that nothing in this development is going to have an impact on our water well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8016)|
| 2:13:45| So that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| Got a question for Mr. Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| Yeah, I'll go ahead and answer that too. Yes, our road widening, we don't want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8032)|
| 2:14:03| we don't have to widen any further than what's required. So the plan that we have approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| through Knox County Engineering widens Sam Lee Road up to, I guess that's Road E there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8049)|
| 2:14:15| that you see on there, and that would be going to the north. So anything south of Road E would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| not be widened. There'll be a taper to get it back down to the standard width at Sam Lee Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8060)|
| 2:14:27| but no, the widening is from Road E and north along Sam Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8067)|
| 2:14:35| Okay, and this is just a point of information to staff that the location of the new entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8075)|
| 2:14:44| is not in the file, in the revised file or in the original file, and it would be very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8084)|
| 2:14:52| in the future if somebody's got a dog barking there, but it'd be helpful in the future if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8092)|

| 2:20:40| infrastructure is there. This use is compatible with this area. The only residential zone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| allows for a boarding house is agricultural. Prior to the rezoning and use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| this land was zoned for four residential units per acre in a PR zone and had a use on review for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8452)|
| 2:20:58| assisted living approved in 2012. Since this property has been used as a group home beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8458)|
| 2:21:04| in 1969, most if not all the neighbors chose to live next to a group home. They purchased their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8464)|

| 2:21:16| since it was built has been a group home of some sort. Many people not associated with Angelic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| Ministries have told you what it is or who it is that will live in this boarding house. They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8482)|

| 2:21:33| and we will not operate one in this building. It is not part of our mission or goals to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| a drug rehab program. In order for these men to even be admitted into our program, they must first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8498)|
| 2:21:44| pass a drug test. These men are going into people's houses and picking up furniture or other items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8504)|

| 2:21:55| and doing other tasks that they cannot be impaired doing. What Angelic Ministries provides for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| men is a vital step in their process of healing. We do not deny that in the past some of these men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| have struggled with substance abuse. We also do not deny that some of these men have never struggled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| with substance abuse. What is the same for all these men is that they were not taught to be men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| fathers, husbands, and servants. At Angelic, that's what we do. It is a long process, a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8537)|
| 2:22:23| because this process requires support, commitment, and time. These men need to learn how to cook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| do laundry, get up in the morning and go to work, create a budget, pay bills, show their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| love, ask for forgiveness, and to forgive. These things do not happen in a drug rehab facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8554)|
| 2:22:41| or a jail or a shelter. That is why we are none of those. Life lessons can only be taught in a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8561)|

| 2:22:52| and walk with them each day. It's important to note that the men that come into our program do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8572)|
| 2:22:57| so voluntarily. They come to us on their own choosing and because of the success that Angelic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8577)|

| 2:23:39| change the path they're on. The data shows this and cannot be denied. We humbly ask for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| support in allowing Angelic Ministries to do a job that we've been called to do. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8625)|

| 2:24:10| of time if needed because we've combined. Is that okay? Yeah, if you could give us your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8650)|

| 2:24:36| proposed use in their decisions. Today, the MPC has the right and has been entrusted with the duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8676)|
| 2:24:43| to closely review this request and should deny it because this proposal is incompatible with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| area. It exceeds the capacity of the use being requested, and I contend that this use does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8687)|

| 2:25:20| I attended a two-hour meeting this fall hosted by the applicants who described their proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| as having that same primary purpose. The applicants stated that a lot of the males| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| would have drugs or alcohol in their past, and they aim to house these men under supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8729)|
| 2:25:35| because they are not ready to live in the applicants' existing unsupervised homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| Those other unsupervised homes are listed on the Tennessee Department of Corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| as having a focus on drug treatment and as providing 12-step programs. This proposed facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8744)|
| 2:25:50| would be a prerequisite to those homes. Their application includes a correction where 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8750)|
| 2:25:57| residents has been crossed out and replaced with 12. 16 to 1 happens to be the staffing ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8757)|
| 2:26:02| required by a TDOC halfway house. Also, if 12 is the maximum number of residents allowed in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8762)|
| 2:26:08| boarding home per zoning ordinance, wouldn't the proposed 12 residents plus two live-in staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8768)|
| 2:26:12| exceed this capacity? If not, what is the maximum occupancy? And I ask that because there's 19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| bedrooms shown in their building plan. That's seven bedrooms beyond the capacity specified in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| the zoning ordinance for a boarding home, and that's assuming only one man per bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8783)|
| 2:26:29| This proposed use doesn't seem to fit the definition of a boarding home per zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| where residents would get basic help with food, shelter, basic hygiene, and care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| This proposal sounds more like a supervised but inadequately secured halfway house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8797)|
| 2:26:42| and that should not be allowed in this residential area. There's hundreds of single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| most with children. There's four bus stops for schools. There's a child daycare center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8807)|
| 2:26:52| and that's all within a half a mile of this property. Similar housing is zoned and built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| here continually each year. It's for these reasons that I argue that this proposed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8816)|
| 2:27:02| while having a noble intent, is simply incompatible with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| Local residents view it as a hazard to their families and believe it will negatively impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| their property values. You've received hundreds of online comments and petitions in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8830)|

| 2:27:28| had her life impacted by a facility like this. Thank you, Mr. Shea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| Thank you. Ms. Kozak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| Hi. Stephanie Kozak, 3100 Champions Trail Lane. Growing up, my father ran two different homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8857)|
| 2:27:46| exactly like the one proposed here in Texas and in Tennessee, so my neighbors have actually asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| me to speak and hopefully shed some light on the risks of this being in such close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| from my own personal experience. In Texas, we lived on the other side of a 600-acre property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8876)|
| 2:28:02| from the men's home, and my dad tried to shield us from that environment as best he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| And even with security protocols in place, one of the men found the opportunity to rape my little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8887)|
| 2:28:13| sister. And this man had no prior criminal history and was actually referred by his church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8893)|
| 2:28:18| And the sad truth is, there are people capable of that anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8898)|
| 2:28:23| but this type of home so close to us is opening up more danger than we are willing to risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| That's why this plan was rejected by the Halls community, and that's why it is being opposed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| our community. And while we recognize that there is a great need for a home like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8913)|
| 2:28:38| it would be safer in a more remote area, because they cannot guarantee the integrity of every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8918)|
| 2:28:44| single resident, or that something like that won't happen here, even in a Christian program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8924)|
| 2:28:49| And while I know it's unfair to assume any resident would be like that man in Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8929)|
| 2:28:54| it only takes one. One opportunity to almost destroy someone's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8934)|
| 2:28:59| And you may think that's dramatic, but I have lived that worst-case scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8939)|
| 2:29:03| and I know what the men in this type of program could be capable of. So what we ask you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8943)|
| 2:29:09| consider is, would you be willing to risk that for your community or for your child? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8949)|
| 2:29:16| Thank you, Ms. Kozick. Mr. Bartholomew, do you have some time left to rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8956)|
| 2:29:24| I think it's time for commission to discuss. I don't have anything else to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8964)|
| 2:29:29| Thank you so much. Chair will open up for commission's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8969)|
| 2:29:33| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| I wanted to follow up with staff some of the questions that came up during the preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8977)|
| 2:29:44| agenda regarding the fact that the application is coming under the category of group home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8984)|
| 2:29:52| but doesn't appear to meet the group home standard. Where do we stand with that analysis now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8992)|
| 2:29:58| Where do we stand with that analysis now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=8998)|
| 2:30:04| Sorry. So this is Liz Albertson. Liz, could you speak up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| Yeah. This is Liz Albertson with Planning. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9008)|
| 2:30:12| Yes. I'm also going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| rely hopefully on Steve Elliott, if he is on with us from the county. Hopefully he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9017)|
| 2:30:26| on with us. I'm not sure if he is on with us. I'm not sure if he is on with us, Liz, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9026)|
| 2:30:36| Yeah, Liz, he is on, and he can address this if you would want to go ahead and send it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9036)|
| 2:30:42| Okay. Yeah. Steve, so the site plan that we've been given, I believe you've seen it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9042)|
| 2:30:51| and then two apartments without kitchens and one apartment with a kitchenette and a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| entrance. And then, you know, the zoning ordinance mentions that the maximum capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| of a boarding house is 12 persons. Steve, would you like to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9063)|
| 2:31:14| Yes, Liz. We've discussed it. Steve Elliott, 205 West Baxter. We've discussed it internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9074)|
| 2:31:21| with staff, and the definition for a boarding house in the zoning ordinance says a dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9081)|
| 2:31:26| or part thereof in which lodging is and meals from a common kitchen are provided by the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| or operator for not more than 12 persons. So we think the owner-operator could have 12 persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9091)|
| 2:31:37| so they could have 12 beds plus the owner-operator of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9097)|
| 2:31:44| And my next question is to the applicant. Given this determination, you will probably need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9104)|
| 2:31:53| if you want to proceed with consideration, you will probably need to rework your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9113)|
| 2:32:00| What is your opinion on that? We would meet whatever the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9120)|
| 2:32:08| determination was. Commissioner, as you asked on Tuesday, and what county had told us is 12 plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9128)|
| 2:32:18| the owner-operator. So we're quite all right with being limited to 12 plus the staff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9138)|
| 2:32:29| It's been a process just to kind of get to that point, and so we don't have, we have no issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9149)|
| 2:32:36| limiting it to 12 plus the staff. Commissioner Corblick, and my staff's interpretation would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9156)|
| 2:32:45| if they choose to have more than 12 residents, they would have to come back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9165)|
| 2:32:50| We think they're here today to get 12 approved, so if they try to exceed that 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9170)|
| 2:32:55| they would have to come back before this body and get another boarding home approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| Okay. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9179)|
| 2:33:11| Commissioner Smith. Hey, Scott had his hand up before I did, Pat. I just don't want to jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9191)|
| 2:33:17| ahead of him. Go ahead, Eddie. That's fine. Go ahead. Okay. So let me ask, so a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9197)|
| 2:33:27| questions. One, I tried to ask this question, had to type it on Tuesday in the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9207)|
| 2:33:33| Based on what the petitioner has brought to us, there's a 40-year history of this being used as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9213)|
| 2:33:41| a group home. So I guess the question I have for staff is you're denying, this one is being denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9221)|
| 2:33:48| based on it doesn't meet a certain criteria, one of those being infrastructure. Can you describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9228)|
| 2:33:55| what went into that process? Because based on what was just stated, the fact that they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9235)|
| 2:33:58| to bring sewer up the street, the KUB can service area, what other things would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9238)|
| 2:34:06| meet the qualifications under infrastructure and the reason that it's being denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9246)|
| 2:34:13| Yes. So this is Liz Albertson. So I'll speak a little to this, but then I may also defer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9253)|
| 2:34:21| Knox County. So in 2012, there was a use on review that occurred for this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9261)|
| 2:34:32| for a assisted living facility. This was never actually converted into an assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9272)|
| 2:34:42| facility. It noted in that staff report that the site was served by an undersized water line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9282)|
| 2:34:50| and the nearest fire hydrant is approximately 1,300 feet from the building and the upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9290)|
| 2:34:56| would be needed to meet the fire code, including sprinklering the building as well as ensuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9296)|
| 2:35:04| the adequate fire flow is available from the hydrant located within the required distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9304)|
| 2:35:10| from the building. That report also notes that an improved driveway would have to be constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9310)|
| 2:35:18| and staff recommended that the driveway be a minimum of 20 feet or 25 feet wide and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9318)|
| 2:35:26| it be paved. And it also notes that some site distance issues possibly for that entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9326)|
| 2:35:33| location. So that was in 2012. And then in 2017, a rezoning was applied for for this area to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9333)|
| 2:35:46| the OB zone district. Staff recommended denial of that, and part of that was based on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9346)|
| 2:35:56| no new roads or utilities were planned for this area to make it suitable for greater than low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9356)|
| 2:36:02| density residential land use intensities. So... Okay. So based on what the applicant has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9362)|
| 2:36:09| which is the increased sewer, the sprinkler system, what other conditions haven't been met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| that they've already... Was all of that in their application that then came back with a denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| on infrastructure if they put in all the things they were planning on improving as part of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9380)|
| 2:36:26| So I will say one of the other issues staff had with this is that the capacity shown on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9386)|
| 2:36:32| plan is above and beyond what is called for as the maximum capacity for a boardinghouse definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9392)|
| 2:36:41| So, I mean, you know, I feel like this would be a different application to review if all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9401)|
| 2:36:46| information were included in it. You know, we provided some comments back to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9406)|
| 2:36:54| the first time around, and they presented a revised site plan. And, you know, boardinghouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9414)|
| 2:37:03| are permitted not as a use on review, but by right in the commercial zone districts of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9423)|
| 2:37:12| CA and CB zones. And those are generally located in areas where there is sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9432)|
| 2:37:17| infrastructure to support more intensive uses than those in low density residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9437)|
| 2:37:24| Okay. And I am looking at everything that the applicant submitted, and everything says 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9444)|
| 2:37:31| people in it. Even looking at the building layout, it doesn't show beds and all of that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| how did the staff determine which rooms were going to be bedrooms to get to the 13 plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9457)|
| 2:37:43| which would knock them out even though their application listed 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| Yeah, if you will actually zoom in on the site plan, Taryn, if you could zoom in on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9467)|
| 2:37:53| site plan that shows the room layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9473)|
| 2:38:02| I apologize. It's just a little small to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| Yeah. We need to try to zoom in on that. If that doesn't work, I can show you a graphic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9484)|
| 2:38:12| that I made that I presented, I believe, during agenda review that shows where the bedrooms are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9492)|
| 2:38:17| So can you see that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9497)|
| 2:38:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9502)|
| 2:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9503)|
| 2:38:24| So those are beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| Yeah. So those are bedrooms. So everything that you see on the east side of or sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9506)|
| 2:38:33| the west side of the plan are bedrooms. So there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 on that west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9513)|
| 2:38:43| side of the building. In the middle of the building there, those are listed as two apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9523)|
| 2:38:49| You can also see those with bathrooms. And then on the west side of the building, you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9529)|
| 2:38:58| two more bathrooms on the north side of the plan or sorry, rooms with bathrooms on the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9538)|
| 2:39:05| of the plan, they're listed as bedrooms and then two more on the south side and then adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| the one on the south side. That one is shown as a different type of room, but it does include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9551)|
| 2:39:22| a bathroom with a shower with it. So it appears like a bedroom. And then on the north east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9562)|
| 2:39:36| there's actually a room that doesn't have a bathroom on it, but it does list bedroom at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9576)|
| 2:39:41| that location. And then in the top northern most portion of the plan, you can see the kitchenette| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9581)|
| 2:39:54| bedroom area that also includes a living room space. So I mean, there's more capacity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9594)|
| 2:40:01| the potential of more than 12 residents based on this site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9601)|
| 2:40:07| Okay. What would be the ramifications? I mean, assuming that we were to pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9607)|
| 2:40:13| they can't have more than 12. If they were found to have more than that, what are the ramifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9613)|
| 2:40:18| I will defer to Knox County for enforcement issues related to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9618)|
| 2:40:25| If they had more than 12 residents in there, it would be a violation of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| But Commissioner Smith, that would be very difficult for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| enforce. We would have to gain access to the facility to actually count bedrooms and residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9633)|
| 2:40:40| And if they didn't give us permission, we would have to, I guess, seek an administrative search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9640)|
| 2:40:46| warrant, which would be difficult to get. So enforcement of more than 12 would be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9646)|
| 2:40:53| I will say this. I don't think we would approve this plan as is in the code's office. We could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9653)|
| 2:40:58| only approve up to the 12 residents. So I think when it got to codes for our review, we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| some serious questions about why are we putting this many bedrooms when we're only approved for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9663)|
| 2:41:09| 12 residents. Okay. On the codes issue, have you all had any complaints or issues with Angelic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9669)|
| 2:41:18| Ministries on any other locations that they operate? Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| Okay. So this is a question, I guess, for the applicant or anyone that has, in all the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9682)|
| 2:41:29| that Angelic has been in operation, I understand there's always the issue that a bad actor can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9689)|
| 2:41:35| get through. But in all the years they've been in operation, has Angelic had any law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9695)|
| 2:41:41| dispatched to any of their facilities for an issue with the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9701)|
| 2:41:47| Law enforcement dispatched to any of their facilities for an issue with the people they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9707)|
| 2:41:53| are serving? Commissioner Smith, this is Parker, and I'm actually here with the Executive Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9713)|
| 2:41:59| Tony Earl. I will say that before we answer that, we will build 12 units, and if so, if we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9719)|
| 2:42:12| remove bathrooms or bedrooms or whatever, we'll do it to that. On to the question of if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9732)|
| 2:42:21| ever been any issue, I'll let Tony Earl address that. Well, Commissioners, and I'd be glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9741)|
| 2:42:29| answer that. In the 12-plus years that we've been operating here in those houses and where the men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| live that are going through this life recovery program that we offer, we've had one time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9756)|
| 2:42:46| the police have been called out, and that was just our guys being loud in the front yard, never had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9766)|
| 2:42:52| any kind of disturbance, any kind of call of any kind of crime committed or anything like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9772)|
| 2:42:58| in 12-plus years that I've been Director here at Angelic Ministries. Thank you. And we have nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9778)|
| 2:43:05| houses. We rent some of those, too, so we have some rental properties that generate revenue for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| us to do what we do, and we've not had any problem or law enforcement being called to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9791)|
| 2:43:21| Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9801)|
| 2:43:25| Yeah, I just wanted to say how I enjoyed listening to what Parker Bartholomew said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9805)|
| 2:43:36| and, you know, I respect those guys so much for what they're doing, and I know that this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9816)|
| 2:43:41| thing is needed, and the people that are in these programs are not less than anybody else in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9821)|
| 2:43:47| community, and we want to support them. At the same time, this is a tough one, you know, I look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9827)|
| 2:43:54| issue, and would you choose this location if the building wasn't there? I mean, it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9834)|
| 2:44:01| a strange location to put this, and in zoning, we look at land use based on where the land is and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9841)|
| 2:44:08| what it's around, and I kind of feel like the only reason that they're wanting to go here is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9848)|
| 2:44:14| there's a building there that's real easy to make work for what they want to do, but I just, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9854)|
| 2:44:18| concerned that not only for the neighbors, but I don't know how good of a location it is for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9858)|
| 2:44:23| guys that are in there. I mean, you know, where do they go? They're back at the end of that little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9863)|
| 2:44:28| road, and, you know, what do they do on weekends? There's no greenway, there's no access to a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9868)|
| 2:44:35| there's not a grocery store around. I think what we've got, we got, we're dealing with this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9875)|
| 2:44:42| this building was once used for something like this, but I just, I'm not sure that this use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9882)|
| 2:44:48| is appropriate for this location. But anyway, that's what I have to say. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9888)|
| 2:44:55| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Dick Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| Yes, thank you. I think, except for maybe Scott's last comments there, we've been talking around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9899)|
| 2:45:08| the subject. This is a use on review. What is the use of the property? It doesn't matter whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9908)|
| 2:45:19| that there's 12 people there or 14. It's what is it going to be used for? And I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9919)|
| 2:45:27| what we should be looking at. Not that there's going to be 12, or 14, or 16. That doesn't mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9927)|
| 2:45:38| a thing. It doesn't mean a thing to me. But the use of the property, and I think that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9938)|
| 2:45:45| neighborhood has stated very well why they're opposed to it. And I think Scott Smith did the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9945)|
| 2:45:55| same thing. He didn't say he was opposed to it, but he questioned the location and the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9955)|
| 2:46:04| area and so forth. I think that's what we should be looking at, rather than maybe the technicalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9964)|
| 2:46:12| of whether there's a sewer serving it, or there's 10, or 12, or 14 occupants. That's all I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9972)|
| 2:46:21| say. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9981)|
| 2:46:27| Thank you, Chair Phillips. I want to speak just a minute to the enforcement of number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9987)|
| 2:46:34| residents. We have that same challenge in single family homes. So let's be clear with that, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=9994)|
| 2:46:41| we have limits on number of unrelated family members. And yes, it's difficult to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10001)|
| 2:46:48| but I don't see any evidence that these folks are trying to shirk the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10008)|
| 2:46:56| When I came on here, I thought I was the last to raise my hand, and I really wanted to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10016)|
| 2:47:01| motion to approve, if you will allow me that, or I can wait to allow the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10021)|
| 2:47:07| I just don't think, given the fact, and this is a hard one, it's not an easy one, but given the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10027)|
| 2:47:13| fact that the only residential zoning that would allow this on review is in agriculture, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10033)|
| 2:47:21| don't see this being a bad place for it. I don't, I certainly think there's no wrong place to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10041)|
| 2:47:28| folks get their feet back underneath them. And, you know, we talked about, and I'm so sensitive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10048)|
| 2:47:36| the young lady who had, I think, a relative raped, but it's not fair to, I guess, infer that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10056)|
| 2:47:44| groups like this. I mean, there's probably more spousal rapes than there are any other type rapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10064)|
| 2:47:50| So to infer that it's people trying to get their feet back on the ground or in a drug rehab, I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10070)|
| 2:47:57| I think we ought to think a little more broadly and not come to false conclusions or overgeneralize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10077)|
| 2:48:04| those conclusions. But, you know, hey, the real pandemic is not the one that will end with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10084)|
| 2:48:11| vaccine. We're dealing with more deaths per day on an ongoing basis from people who are trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10091)|
| 2:48:18| get their lives back on track here, and we're in an agricultural setting. And I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10098)|
| 2:48:23| in what other agricultural setting, you know, would make it right versus this one. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10103)|
| 2:48:29| Chair, I'll leave it up to you if you'll allow me to make the motion or wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10109)|
| 2:48:33| CHAIR BAILET You can make a motion, but before we vote, we will listen from three more commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10113)|
| 2:48:39| who have their hands up. But if you'd like to make a motion, you're absolutely welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| COMMISSIONER HICKS Thank you for that opportunity. I'd like to make a motion to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| applicant's request for a boarding home up to 12 residents with two staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| COMMISSIONER RODGERS Is that seconded by Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| COMMISSIONER HICKS Yes, or Commissioner Dennington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| COMMISSIONER RODGERS Who made the who seconded the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| COMMISSIONER HICKS You can go ahead and write| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10145)|
| 2:49:09| me down. I think we tied. COMMISSIONER RODGERS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10149)|
| 2:49:11| Okay. So, we have a motion and a second. Before we go to vote, I will ask to open it up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10151)|
| 2:49:18| Commissioner Eason. COMMISSIONER EASON| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10158)|
| 2:49:21| Thank you. I'd like to say I wanted to say I agree with a lot of Commissioner Scott Smith's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10161)|
| 2:49:26| comments. I think that this is a good intent, but the wrong location for it. And there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10166)|
| 2:49:34| I think as Liz said, there are a couple of commercial zones where this would be perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10174)|
| 2:49:39| appropriate. And I do think the number of residents is an important thing, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10179)|
| 2:49:45| it's difficult for us to enforce. I think it's important because that's before us and it's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10185)|
| 2:49:50| the documents that we're looking at, where it does say 16 borders on one of the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10190)|
| 2:49:56| is before us today. So, for those couple of reasons, I'll have to vote against the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10196)|
| 2:50:02| COMMISSIONER HICKS Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10202)|
| 2:50:05| Commissioner Adams. COMMISSIONER ADAMS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| Thank you. Can I just, I'm sorry to ask this again, but I'm confused about the occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10209)|
| 2:50:15| because it sounded like at one point, the statement was made that they, the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10215)|
| 2:50:26| could have 12 borders and a staff member. So, that was like a 13 number. And then there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10226)|
| 2:50:34| an assessment that it was more than 12. But didn't we just hear that it was okay if it was more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10234)|
| 2:50:40| 12 if those were staff? Can someone clarify that? And then I have something else I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| COMMISSIONER LIZ PETERSON Yes, this is Liz. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10245)|
| 2:50:53| Steve Elliott will be able to respond to how they interpret the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10253)|
| 2:50:59| COMMISSIONER STEVE ELLIOTT Yes, Commissioner. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| interpretation by staff is that in the definition of a boarding home, it says owner operator may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10263)|
| 2:51:09| have up to 12 residents or 12 borders. So, it would be our interpretation that the owner-operator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10269)|
| 2:51:16| could have 12 beds plus the owner-operator. And, you know, our interpretation, that would be two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10276)|
| 2:51:22| would be, would meet the intent of the owner-operator. So, we would think up to 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10282)|
| 2:51:27| two owner-operators and then 12 borders. COMMISSIONER MARY ANN BORGESON| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| Okay. The other thing I just wanted to add is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10291)|
| 2:51:40| I think it's a misnomer that this type of getting back on your feet is only appropriate in an urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10300)|
| 2:51:49| setting. That this type of less urban setting may actually provide the exact kind of sanctuary that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10309)|
| 2:51:58| someone needs to be able to do that because there are fewer distractions and fewer negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10318)|
| 2:52:06| temptations, potentially, especially with the van being such a limited time out and time in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10326)|
| 2:52:17| I just think that that's important to recognize that it's not just an urban environment that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10337)|
| 2:52:22| appropriate for people kind of relearning life skills. That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10342)|
| 2:52:28| CHAIR BAILET Commissioner Korbelik. COMMISSIONER JANE KORBELIK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10348)|
| 2:52:33| Yes. I had a question for Mr. Wise. Given that the motion is the opposite of the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10353)|
| 2:52:42| recommendation, do we need to actually express findings that would be contrary to the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10362)|
| 2:52:47| findings? Or is it enough just with the discussion that we've had to proceed with the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10367)|
| 2:52:56| MR. WISE I think the discussion itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| since the minutes are now so complete, we have minutes that are, of course, incorporated, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10378)|
| 2:53:04| have the recorded meetings with the practice being in the past that all of the comments are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10384)|
| 2:53:12| incorporated into the findings and the vote is based on that. If the movement would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10392)|
| 2:53:19| comfortable in putting forth the reasons for it, that's fine, so it doesn't hurt. But it would not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10399)|
| 2:53:25| in my opinion, it would not be defective if the motion failed to have specific findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10405)|
| 2:53:30| COMMISSIONER JANE KORBELIK Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| MR. WILSON Hey, Steve, let me just say something on that. I think in the past, as long as I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| been on this Commission, there's numerous times that there's been motions contrary to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10417)|
| 2:53:43| recommendations. And sometimes it may simply be that a Commissioner has this opinion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10423)|
| 2:53:49| differs from staff recommendations. And I don't know that we have to have a legal reason to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10429)|
| 2:53:55| disagree with them. COMMISSIONER TAYLOR That's right. That has been the practice in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10435)|
| 2:54:00| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS Thank you. Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10440)|
| 2:54:05| Commissioner Crowder. COMMISSIONER CASSIDY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10445)|
| 2:54:08| Thank you, Chairman Phillips. I've been listening to this, and I think from my comments on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10448)|
| 2:54:14| agenda meeting, it's hard to support this location. I agree with Commissioner Smith that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10454)|
| 2:54:24| I'm all for helping people. And these people definitely do need help. I'd like to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10464)|
| 2:54:29| address the question that was answered about, had there been any police calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10469)|
| 2:54:35| to the area on Central Avenue? And the answer was one that they knew of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10475)|
| 2:54:40| There has been several fire department calls for NARCAN use. I can't say exactly to this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10480)|
| 2:54:50| building, but within a block or half a block of it, there's 11 documented calls for NARCAN use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| in this general vicinity. I'd also like to ask Mr. Bartholomew, if some of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10496)|
| 2:55:08| some of these people are currently on parole, or is parole an issue with them being part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10508)|
| 2:55:18| treatment plant? COMMISSIONER TAYLOR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10518)|
| 2:55:23| Commissioner, if you would, can you ask that question again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| COMMISSIONER BARTHOLOMEW Yes. You obviously already have some people set up for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10525)|
| 2:55:32| for this treatment. Are any of those currently on parole, or is parole part of their treatment plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10532)|
| 2:55:42| COMMISSIONER TAYLOR Currently, some of the men that are in the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| are on parole. I don't know what you mean by part of their treatment plan, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10547)|
| 2:55:52| COMMISSIONER BARTHOLOMEW There's, you can, a lot of people having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10552)|
| 2:55:57| this type of problem are asked the question, would you rather go to jail or go to treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10557)|
| 2:56:03| And naturally, they would choose treatment over going to jail. So is part of the plea bargain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10563)|
| 2:56:11| for some of these problems part of receiving this treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10571)|
| 2:56:17| COMMISSIONER TAYLOR No, sir. Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10577)|
| 2:56:21| The people that come here, they have to first be, they first have to apply to us. So it's not part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10581)|
| 2:56:29| of a plea or anything. They have to apply for admittance, and we have to let them in. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10589)|
| 2:56:34| not, there's not a judge or something that says, hey, go to Angelic or go to jail. It's almost the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10594)|
| 2:56:41| exact opposite of that. It is people come to us, they ask to be part of the program, and then they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10601)|
| 2:56:49| have to go through an admittance process to get into the program. So we're not just taking people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10609)|
| 2:56:54| in so that they don't go to jail. COMMISSIONER BARTHOLOMEW Okay. The other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10614)|
| 2:56:58| what's the duties of the two staff there? COMMISSIONER TAYLOR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10618)|
| 2:57:02| They are going to live there full time. They've been with us for four years. One of them is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10622)|
| 2:57:11| family member of the founder, Betsy Frazier. So they will live there. That will be their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10631)|
| 2:57:20| And that's what that back apartment is on the site plan. That's where they will live. It's not that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10640)|
| 2:57:29| they will be coming and going or that there will be separate folks. This will be their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10649)|
| 2:57:36| with these men. COMMISSIONER BARTHOLOMEW| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| What are their duties? COMMISSIONER TAYLOR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10658)|
| 2:57:42| I mean, their duties are to take care, I mean, just like a mother or a father. And so they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10662)|
| 2:57:48| going to be responsible for taking the van back and forth. They'll go shopping. They'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10668)|
| 2:57:56| help them with budgeting. They keep a record of, you know, all of their income, their expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10676)|
| 2:58:05| cooking, laundry services, yard work. I guess all the normal things that parents would do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10685)|
| 2:58:15| children. COMMISSIONER HICKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| I have to agree with Scott also. You're a long way. If you read the scenario of their daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10699)|
| 2:58:26| daily doings, you know, up at six, breakfast by a certain time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10706)|
| 2:58:33| catch a van and go down to Central Avenue and work. There's places downtown, which would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10713)|
| 2:58:43| much closer. The problem of escorting or traveling with that many men, two trips a day, that far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10723)|
| 2:58:51| away. And I've got one other question. You had mentioned earlier in our conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10731)|
| 2:58:58| that these men can walk away from this at any time. They're not required. They're not bound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10738)|
| 2:59:04| to be there. Is that true? COMMISSIONER TAYLOR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10744)|
| 2:59:09| Yes. Yeah, this is not a jail. They're able to leave. Now, when they leave, we're not just going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10749)|
| 2:59:18| to say, you know, walk away. If they choose to leave, then we're going to we're going to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10758)|
| 2:59:23| them, you know, get on an airplane or have family pick them up or something. It's not where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10763)|
| 2:59:31| just going to walk away and start walking down the street. It's not a jail. COMMISSIONER HICKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10771)|
| 2:59:37| But it is a secured facility. COMMISSIONER TAYLOR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10777)|
| 2:59:40| You mean, I mean, there's a fence around it and there's security systems on the doors. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10780)|
| 2:59:45| COMMISSIONER HICKS You list in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10785)|
| 2:59:51| description that it's a gated lock community. COMMISSIONER TAYLOR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10791)|
| 2:59:57| Yes, it's a gated. It's a gated. There's a fence around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10797)|
| 3:00:01| COMMISSIONER HICKS Well, I agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10801)|
| 3:00:07| This needs to happen. But this is just not the location for that. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10807)|
| 3:00:12| a it's too far away from what you're trying to accomplish with this with these men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10812)|
| 3:00:20| It'd be great to have a facility somewhere around the Dempster plant, which is just a few blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10820)|
| 3:00:26| from you to where they could literally walk back and forth to where they need to be as a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10826)|
| 3:00:31| rather than than be bused. COMMISSIONER TAYLOR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| Commissioner, we appreciate that. But we don't want them on the street. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10835)|
| 3:00:40| what Commissioner Adams said, what we've found is these secluded areas away from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10840)|
| 3:00:48| you know, the temptation is, you know, we want a home life. That's what we're looking for. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10848)|
| 3:00:57| that's why there was a children's home on this site starting back in 1969. And it operated there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10857)|
| 3:01:02| till 87. And, you know, even assisted living there. If you look at the children's homes or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10862)|
| 3:01:09| other homes that are in Knox County right now, I mean, there's another one just north of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10869)|
| 3:01:14| subdivision off of West Emory that you all approved in a very rural area. They're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10874)|
| 3:01:19| these areas for a reason. I mean, the Men's Military Institute in Sweetwater, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10879)|
| 3:01:26| they're in these rural areas for a reason. And I think that Commissioner Adams hit it spot on for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10886)|
| 3:01:33| why that is. COMMISSIONER ADAMS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| I agree. But there's a huge difference in what you're committing to do here and having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10895)|
| 3:01:41| children's home. Children's homes, normally people are not undergoing treatment and coping problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10901)|
| 3:01:49| The assisted living, they're normally not being treated for a dependency problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10909)|
| 3:01:59| and trying to deal with coping with life. I agree. I'm all for you having a facility very similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10919)|
| 3:02:09| this. I just think this is the wrong location. You're in the middle of several subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10929)|
| 3:02:16| even though it's tucked back into the woods, there's still lots of children playing in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10936)|
| 3:02:20| coming and going from this facility. But I appreciate our conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10940)|
| 3:02:25| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS Yes. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10945)|
| 3:02:27| COMMISSIONER ADAMS Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10947)|
| 3:02:30| COMMISSIONER SCOTT SMITH Question. Oh, yeah, question and comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10950)|
| 3:02:37| The question is, a use-on review in this situation, does it follow the property or the user?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10957)|
| 3:02:42| In other words, if Angelic Ministries occupies this facility and they run it for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10962)|
| 3:02:47| and then they decide to leave the facility, is it still permitted for this general use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10967)|
| 3:02:54| someone else could come in and do something a little different? But with, I mean, or is it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| does it follow with the ministry? COMMISSIONER ALBERTSON| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10979)|
| 3:03:03| This is Liz Albertson. I will defer to Knox County and what their interpretation would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10983)|
| 3:03:10| if there was new ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10990)|
| 3:03:13| COMMISSIONER SMITH Yes, Commissioner Smith. I think if Angelic Ministries moved out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10993)|
| 3:03:18| that it would need a new use-on review for a new owner if a new owner came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=10998)|
| 3:03:23| I think the use-on review would go with the current owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| COMMISSIONER ADAMS Is Angelic Ministries buying it or leasing it? I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11006)|
| 3:03:32| That's my question is, does it follow the property or the use, the user?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11012)|
| 3:03:36| COMMISSIONER SMITH I think it follows the user. If a new user came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11016)|
| 3:03:41| we would need a new use-on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11021)|
| 3:03:43| COMMISSIONER SMITH And Commissioner, we're purchasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11023)|
| 3:03:48| COMMISSIONER ADAMS Okay. Second thing, and this is just kind of a general comment. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11028)|
| 3:03:52| we've had a couple of these types of uses. And again, I really support all of these type uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11032)|
| 3:04:01| that help people. But the problem when you do it in the ag zone, it kind of is like somebody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11041)|
| 3:04:08| trying to do it, go in the back door, you know. And when that's the problem, it leaves us as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11048)|
| 3:04:13| commissioners having to ask a lot of questions about the way these things will operate that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11053)|
| 3:04:19| really don't have the knowledge or expertise to dissect. So that's the hard part for us as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11059)|
| 3:04:27| commissioners. When you do this in the ag zone as a use-on review, and we have to answer to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11067)|
| 3:04:31| the neighbors about, you know, the particulars of it, it just makes it tough. So anyway, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11071)|
| 3:04:37| Let's vote. COMMISSIONER HICKS Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11077)|
| 3:04:40| We have a motion by Commissioner Hill and seconded by, I think, who was it? Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11080)|
| 3:04:47| COMMISSIONER ROTH Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| COMMISSIONER HICKS Yeah, Commissioner Roth. To approve the boarding home for up to 12 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11090)|
| 3:04:57| with two staff for this property. So, Ms. Cairn, you want to call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11097)|
| 3:05:03| COMMISSIONER CAIRN Yes, Mr. Chair. Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11103)|

| 3:07:03| might I? Before you start time running, there was some suggestion that this is sort of a complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11223)|
| 3:07:12| matter, and I'm sure it is to some extent. I wonder if I could suggest that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11232)|
| 3:07:22| before we start, if we could have a report from staff of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11242)|

| 3:08:09| COMMISSIONER HOOVER Great. Thank you. So I'm just going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11289)|
| 3:08:13| to hit the highlights on it. It probably will be a bit repetitive of the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11293)|
| 3:08:19| for approval that you got in your packet as well. I uploaded kind of an overview of the history of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11299)|
| 3:08:25| the development onto the website earlier this week. So hopefully you've had an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11305)|
| 3:08:31| read that over. But in a nutshell, back in 2013, we brought this before you, before the Board here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11311)|
| 3:08:38| and we rezoned 72.4 acres at planned residential at five units an acre. So that ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11318)|
| 3:08:48| the math comes out to we had 362 dwelling units available for use on all the different parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11328)|
| 3:08:56| areas that we had. In 2013 as well, we were approved by MPC for use on review and concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11336)|
| 3:09:07| for 315 of those 362 available units, dwelling units. So again, if you do the math, you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11347)|
| 3:09:17| the 362 minus the 315 that we had assigned, if you will. At that time, we have 47 units left to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11357)|
| 3:09:28| access with an approved use on review. If you look at the site plan on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11368)|
| 3:09:37| we've already got one approved, again, for this. We had 312 apartment buildings, or pardon me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11377)|
| 3:09:44| 312 units in apartments. It was separated on the east side and the west side of Emory Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11384)|
| 3:09:51| The currently the 240 units that were on the east side are built and being occupied right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11391)|
| 3:09:59| The 72 that were originally approved have not been constructed. That's the area that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11399)|
| 3:10:05| talking about right now and that you see on your screen. The request is to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11405)|
| 3:10:12| from the 72 units to 96 units. With that, we tried to be careful to keep those units going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11412)|
| 3:10:22| from 72 to 96, the additional 24 units, in the same four buildings. So we kept the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11422)|
| 3:10:30| very similar to what was created before. You know, we worked really hard trying to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11430)|
| 3:10:36| hillside and ridgetop plan worked into this. We conserved a lot of area around 20 some odd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11436)|
| 3:10:42| acres across the street. We're only disturbing maybe eight and a half acres of 24 on this side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11442)|
| 3:10:49| of the street. We also, with that use on review, got into a public-private improvement of Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11449)|
| 3:10:57| Drive and Emory Church Road. Ultimately, that ended up in widening sections of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11457)|
| 3:11:02| A new red light was installed, extension of turn lanes. The total improvement cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11462)|
| 3:11:07| was $480,000, of which we paid about $300,000 of that. I believe my civil engineer partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11467)|
| 3:11:19| Nathan Silvas, is on the call as well. I'd like to pass to him. If there's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11479)|
| 3:11:24| time left over, I'd like to reserve that. Hi, Nathan Silvas here. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11484)|
| 3:11:31| Yes, we can hear you. Great. I just have a brief statement here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11491)|
| 3:11:38| about the history of the project as far as what happened back in 2013. I'd like to read into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11498)|
| 3:11:44| record. I was the design engineer for the original Westland Cove project and also I prepared the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11504)|
| 3:11:50| current site plan in the application you're considering today. As Mr. Huber and MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11510)|
| 3:11:56| have confirmed, the original 2013 use on review for Westland Cove created three single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11516)|
| 3:12:02| residential lots and a 312-unit apartment community. I know that these items were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11522)|
| 3:12:07| in that plan because I drew it all. I also drew the figure that was shown to the MPC illustrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11527)|
| 3:12:15| the removal of a commercial marina and the designation of a single-family lot on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11535)|
| 3:12:20| portion of the property. I also prepared a CD with that figure and other materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11540)|
| 3:12:25| and personally submitted it at the MPC meeting. We sold the area of the marina as a single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11545)|
| 3:12:32| residential lot to John and Susan Hancock. I also consulted to the Hancocks after they purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11552)|
| 3:12:39| the property and I coordinated with their architect in siting their home in the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11559)|
| 3:12:45| At no point in that process was a use on review required or discussed. It was just common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11565)|
| 3:12:50| knowledge at the time that Mr. Hancock's lot was a single-family residential lot created by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11570)|
| 3:12:55| 2013 use on review. I was also the engineer for Mr. Frank Gambusa after he purchased a portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11575)|
| 3:13:02| of the property adjacent to his home on Emory Church Road. This lot was clearly designated as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11582)|
| 3:13:08| two lots on the 2013 use on review and after the purchase, Mr. Gambusa hired me to consult to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11588)|
| 3:13:14| when he wanted to add a third lot to the land that he had purchased. This lot was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11594)|
| 3:13:20| to be taken from the Westland Cove approved development plan density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11600)|
| 3:13:25| Acting as chief manager for Clearwater Partners, Mr. Huber provided a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11605)|
| 3:13:29| granting the additional dwelling from the pool of density held in the Westland Cove approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11609)|
| 3:13:34| development plan. And I was in attendance at the MPC meeting as Mr. Gambusa's representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11614)|
| 3:13:40| when Mr. Gambusa's use on review was approved on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11620)|
| 3:13:46| If I'm understanding correctly, the opposition is assuming that these three single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11626)|
| 3:13:52| residential lots created by the 2013 use on review on these lands essentially never occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11632)|
| 3:13:58| Mr. Silvas, I apologize, but you need to wrap up here. Your time is up unless the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11638)|

| 3:14:11| All right, proceed. I'll hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11651)|
| 3:14:17| If I'm understanding correctly, the opposition is asserting that the three single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11657)|

| 3:14:27| The history and record of this property clearly demonstrates this is false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11667)|
| 3:14:31| The designation of these lots was clearly made in 2013 use on review proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11671)|

| 3:14:51| subdivide it. And Mr. Gambusa understood that he would have to go back through a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11691)|
| 3:14:56| process to codify the development right for the additional lot. Mr. Hancock has always understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11696)|
| 3:15:02| that he bought a single-family residential lot. Recently, he gladly provided a signed letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11702)|
| 3:15:07| stating that he bought the lot as a single-family lot with no further development rights. Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201210?start=11707)|
