| 0:02:02| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Sir, do you have the permit with you tonight from the old owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=124)|
| 0:02:12| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| That will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| If you'll talk over here at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| they will tell you about getting the other permit before they can release your current permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| But while I have you up here, how many employees are you going to have in your market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| We have two so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| And how are you going to train your employees to check ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| When they ring up, they ask for ID, and they make sure he or she more than 21 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=157)|
| 0:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| And other than looking at the ID, is there any quick way to see if the person is old enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| Like they want to make sure the ID is not fake or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| And the customer, he should be not too drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Or he, like, make sure everything fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| If he drunk or something, cannot sell anyone beer like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| And make sure your employees know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| If you'll see over here at the end, she'll tell you about getting the other permit in so you can get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| We did vote on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Now let's go back to Anna's Market and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| If you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=208)|

| 0:03:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Ending final documentation or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=229)|

| 0:03:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| We always have special thanks for those people who get everything done on time when they come to apply for their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=234)|

| 0:04:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| And if you'll see at the end of the aisle over here at the end of the podium, she'll have your permit for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| Up here, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| The next business is Casanova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=256)|
| 0:04:27| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| My name is Asma Ish, 2715 Martin Luther King Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Ms. Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| The owner has no applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| The manager, Mr. Watson, was not truthful when he filled out the owner-manager application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| Number nine, he checked no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| The question was have you ever been convicted of any misdemeanors within the last 10 years or have any charges currently pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| And as you can see, that's not the case according to the criminal background check we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| So in that case, it's my understanding that you'll need to have a different manager, that Mr. Watson cannot be the manager of your store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=299)|
| 0:05:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Now, what about the file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| We're waiting on approval from the building inspector and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| I have those forms with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Then you'll be able to give them to her in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| We also have some people who are lined up to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| Do we have the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Do I have the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| The first speaker is Sergeant Phil Major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Do I sit down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| If you can just step aside, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| Actually, if you want to go ahead and have a seat, this might take a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| Sergeant Major, you'll need to give us your name and the group you represent, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| I'm Sergeant Phil Major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| I'm with the Knoxville Police Department's Repeat Offender Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| I've got some information that we just feel that the Beer Board should be made aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| On June the 13th of this year, members of the Knoxville Police Department executed a state search warrant at the Bilo Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| which is at 2700 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| That address is across the street from this applicant, from this application before he did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=380)|
| 0:06:29| In addition to that search warrant, there was also a nuisance injunction that was filed on this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| by the Knox County District Attorney's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| This establishment, this location at 2700 MLK, where the Bilo Market was at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=397)|
| 0:06:45| that location for years has been a haven for criminal activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| including but not limited to multiple robberies, burglaries, assaults, illegal narcotic sales and transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=409)|
| 0:06:58| The business itself was involved in the sale of illegal synthetic marijuana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| From 2009 until the closure of the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| the Knoxville Police Department received over 300 calls for service at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| During the execution of the search warrant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| officers recovered six firearms under the cash register under the counter of the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| and also stolen property was recovered from this business, such as baby formula and cigarettes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| The reason that's important is Ms. Ayesh was an employee of that establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| Ms. Ayesh is related to the owners of the old Bilo Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| She lists in her application the same address as the previous owners of the Bilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| In addition to that, it's also, I think, relevant to the fact that Ms. Ayesh also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| even though she's going to remove Mr. Watson from the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| Mr. Watson was the manager of the old Bilo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| which to me shows the fact that we're looking at the same employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| and the same management that we had at the previous establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| We feel it's the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| They're just moving across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| Of course, Mr. Watson, even though it's over ten years old, as far as applicable records are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=509)|
| 0:08:37| Mr. Watson has a felony record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| The establishment had allowed him to be around these firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| It was present at the Bilo Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| Our concerns are obvious that we're going to have the same employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| and possibly the same management styles in place that were in place at this other establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| where we had criminal activity after criminal activity occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| In all of this occurring, it's within a thousand feet of a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| Just within sight of this establishment and all of these things occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| But our concerns are that if this application is granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| that we will see a continuation, a resurgent of criminal activity at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| Let's continue with the people who are speaking against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Chief Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| I'm Chief David Roush, 445 West Blount Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| Of course, I'm the chief of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| And the reason I'm here is for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| One is obviously to oppose the approval of this permit to Casanova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| I think we need to look at the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| And I've had a lot of back and forth looking at this and trying to figure out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| And I have some concern about what's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| There's a shell game going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| And I think we've got to deal with that shell game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| And I think that's something that's extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| Now, I know that our ordinances and state statutes allow some of this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| And I'm going to call on you to just to please look in your conscience as you make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| And I know, you know, down the road hopefully we can fix this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| and fix the shell game that continues to go on in our community where we have folks who basically turn their back on the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=640)|
| 0:10:50| and then turn around and because of opportunity they put someone else in their family in charge of an operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=650)|
| 0:10:59| and reopen and reestablish the same illegal behavior that's happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| And so that's something we certainly need to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| And also I'm here because of the community that has stepped forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| The church, the folks from the church obviously have major concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| I've spoken to many of the community members in this area and they do not want to see this market open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=679)|
| 0:11:27| They know over the years what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| They were extremely excited when we had the opportunity to shut down the Biola market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| I had more phone calls from that one closure than I have in any of the closures we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| And they were extremely excited that we were able to close and stop major illegal criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=703)|
| 0:11:52| And it all revolved around this one business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| And these owners are the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| We're not seeing a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| We see a different name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| We're going to see the same activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| First of all, Mr. Watson has knowingly, willfully, and untruthfully completed his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| Now, I understand that Ms. Ayesh says that she's going to remove him as the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| That's an easy fix, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| She can stand here and say, oh, okay, take him off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| I mean, that was real simple for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| But he's still standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| He's still here with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| Do we actually think that he's not going to be in that store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| I think common sense tells us we know better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| And so I think you need to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| He has a number of city citations that are outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| He owes the city over $900 in fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| He could care less about law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| He's shown that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| He doesn't show up to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| He doesn't pay his citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| And then he wants to step up and he wants to run a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| What kind of business do you think he's going to run if he turns and scoffs at law enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| When we go and try to do our enforcement, it's not going to mean anything to this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| They're going to turn their back to everything we do, as they have done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| The track record is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Obviously, as Sergeant Major said, we closed the previous business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| There was a lot of criminal activity taking place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| He's explained that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| I think if approved, based on the history that we know, we know what the impact of enforcement to them is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=805)|
| 0:13:34| They don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| They don't care about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| They don't care about what law enforcement does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| They don't care about this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| When we look to have businesses open up in our community, we want responsible owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| These are not responsible owners at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| They've not shown that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| They've shown a complete disregard and disdain for the neighborhood and for law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| And so, based on that, I plead with you to vehemently deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| We have a third speaker, and that's Pastor Brown of the Payne Avenue Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=847)|
| 0:14:22| Pastor R.S. Brown, representing the Payne Avenue Baptist Church at 2714 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| My personal residence is 708 Sunnydale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| After hearing from these gentlemen, I, of course, concur with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=875)|
| 0:14:45| I was coming to inquire as to the distance from the establishment to our church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=885)|
| 0:14:53| and I'm hearing that that measurement possibly has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| So we, again, join with them in asking that this request would be denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| and not only for this instance, but let this be for us a benchmark as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=906)|
| 0:15:14| as we attempt to improve our communities and our city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| I need to talk to Councilwoman Frost in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=921)|
| 0:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=952)|
| 0:16:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| After consulting with our legal advisor, I will need to ask for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| because the manager that is on the application is ineligible to be a manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| or even to work in the establishment, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| that would mean that, Ms. Saish, do you need additional time to get a manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| or just answer yes or no, do you need additional time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| So you're prepared just to remove him tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| That being the case, do I have a yes, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| For the record, the owner is saying that Mr. Watson will not be an owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| excuse me, not be a manager at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Could you speak up to the microphone, please, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Will you be getting another manager at a future date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| So are you wanting the time right now to get a manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Do I need to in order to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| I mean, I will in the future, hopefully like a week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| We have now heard the yes, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| If it's okay, I'd like to ask the Chief a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| How long ago did you close the bylaw, number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| And then, number two, have you seen a real drop in criminal activity in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| To what extent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| I'll have to go to the experts on that, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| When did we shut it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| June of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| June 13th of this year we shut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| And now without going straight to the numbers, I can tell you we know for a fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| that we've had a marked decrease in criminal activity at every one of these locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| We track these very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| And we've had over a 90% decrease in crime at every location that we have shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| And that includes ones that have been allowed to open back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| So they've opened back up under the direction of the judge in these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| And now, as I understand it, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| they had no interest in even attempting to talk with the judge about the possibility of reopening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| under the conditions that were set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| They just chose to attempt a new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Pastor Brown, you asked how many feet the church was from this business, and it's 192 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| That was specifically measured because I know you were interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| That's a practice for every place that there is a potential question that there is a specific measurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| to be sure that it exceeds the 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| All right, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Yes, sir, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| If I understand it right, Ms. Ashe is saying you're going to be the manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| so you don't have a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| You need to come to the microphone, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| And, like, next week I will find a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Then I make a motion that we postpone this until the next meeting until she has a manager to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Yes, Councilman DeLavoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| They don't need to have a manager to seek a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| They do not need a manager to seek a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| They can need someone who's done the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| She's the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| She's completed the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| At such time as she names a new manager, that person will have to fill out an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| have a records check, and complete the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| Are we going to take any action on his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Well, we were asking some questions first, and we have his motion, and we do not have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| Let me see what that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| Well, she's saying she needs a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| She needs time to have a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| No, she's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| She's saying that she is going to be the owner-manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Well, I can be that as of now if I don't have a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| That's what I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| So you're going to be the manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| For a week or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Councilman Wallace made a move to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| Councilman Saunders, do you have a statement to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| Well, I assume that motion has died for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| So if that's the case, I had a question for Mr. Frost about what we can do legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1239)|
| 0:20:52| and I'm disinclined right now to approve this, but at the same time, I'm concerned about the legal stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Let me ask Ms. Martin, the documentation she presented you in terms of applicable inspections, have they now been completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1260)|
| 0:21:12| We're just waiting on building inspection and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| Now, she did appropriately remove Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| I've definitely, you know, heard and understand the concerns of the police department, members of the community and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1284)|
| 0:21:32| But looking at Section 4-64 of the city code, I'll just read part of it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| After all inspections have been made and the applicant for a beer permit has met all requirements of this article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| after all necessary fees and charges have been paid by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| and after the beer board has determined the applicant has complied with all other requirements contained in this article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| the board, meaning the beer board, shall approve the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| After they're all completed, you said, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| The question is, you know, has this beer board developed over the years a custom of passing on applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1323)|
| 0:22:14| where some things have not yet been done, but it's coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| and it's known that the beer permit will not issue until those other inspections have been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1340)|
| 0:22:32| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| After hearing what the chief said, and, you know, we're looking at a shell game here, so I'd be curious, Mr. Foss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| I mean, I think we can accept that as true, given these facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| that it's a shell game that you've got someone that had a permit that's just reapplying through someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| To me, that would be grounds enough to deny the motion or to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| So I would move that we deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| We have a motion and a second to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| I'd like to hear from Dan, Councilman Brown, in terms of what he's heard since this is in his district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| if he has anything that he'd like to add to the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Well, what I've heard is that when the bylaws was closed down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| when I came on council, there were major problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| And most of the people in the community were glad that it was closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| And the church, as well as the members and people in the community, do not want to see this place open again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1415)|
| 0:23:46| Even though we have been told by our council that we cannot deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| but I am certainly not in favor of this place having been able to sell beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1432)|
| 0:24:00| because we've already heard from our law enforcement people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| We see and we've heard from the minister across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| And if it reopens, it just will not be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Councilman DeLavoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| I don't think there's any law written that says that we, as the beer board or as legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| need to leave our common sense at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| I mean, if this is simply an effort to get around a formal closure of a public nuisance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| I think we can take that into account, at least in our own minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| as to the appropriateness of issuing the permit or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| If I'm wrong, I'll let a judge tell me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| I just think that you don't leave your common sense at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| That's what the people elect you to do is use common sense as well as standards and criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| In light of that, if there's no motion made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| There has been a motion and a second to deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| So, in that case, we need to have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Mr. Frost, do we need a roll call vote or a voice vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| Probably a voice vote would suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| From the voice vote, it sounds like it's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| All those in favor of denying this applicant, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| This permit is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| The next applicant is Gunny's Sports Bar on Merrillville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| Or as those from Merrillville say, Merrillville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| We've got Gunny's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| If you'll tell us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| My name is Catherine Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| My home address is 109 Winstead Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| What about the records, Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| No applicable records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration, the corporate charter, certificate of zoning, fire inspector approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| and we need to surrender the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| I have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| You do have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Well, this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Counsel Mandela, vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| I'll second that, but I've got to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Ma'am, I'm a fan of NCIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| Is Gunny's coming from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1587)|

| 0:27:36| Next is the Junkyard on South Central, and we received a letter this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| an e-mail letter asking that we postpone this until January 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| They're making some changes in name, ownership, and various other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| So do I have a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| This is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Then this will be heard on January 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| If you all would pass it in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| And we'll pass those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Save a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| And, by the way, while we're handing these down to Ms. Martin for safekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| we're in big trouble because this is her last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| She has elected to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Despite much arm twisting, she declined to come back to the beer board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| So next month we will have to be training someone new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| But, Ms. Martin, on behalf of the beer board, we are very appreciative of your service, your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| the hours that you have spent listening, and the mounds of paper that you have cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1705)|
| 0:28:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| The next applicant is KJ's Mini Mart and More.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| And this one has also postponed or requested a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1736)|

| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| And I believe that you want to postpone it because you haven't completed the task and the other part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| This is in Mayor Brown's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Do you want to postpone this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Well, we'll move to postpone until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| January 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| How much time would you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Twenty-six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Would that be enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| I'll make a motion that we postpone it until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1770)|

| 0:29:48| What about the file, Sergeant Hunter, or the records, rather?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| No records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1791)|

| 0:29:55| You get a gold star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Well, I do want to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| What does Knox Mason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Tell us how that came about, what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Well, I grew up in Knoxville and lived here for 30 years, and then I moved to Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| And coming back to Knoxville, I wanted to open a restaurant with Knox or Knoxville in the title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| and found a mason jar at a yard sale in Columbia, Tennessee in May, and it said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| Knox Mason on the jar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| And that kind of struck a chord with me, so that's what we decided to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| And we're not a diner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| We're not a bistro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| We're not a cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| It's just a restaurant, and I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| I didn't think Knox Mason Restaurant sounded good, so we just decided to call it Knox Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| Well, it will certainly provoke a lot of curiosity to come and find out your fare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| When will you be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121220?start=1840)|
