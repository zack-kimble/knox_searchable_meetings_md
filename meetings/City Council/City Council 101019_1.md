| 2:27:57| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| Okay, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| I still have a question on inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| Ms. Roddy, a while back there, pointed out that there were some of the things that were on the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8883)|
| 2:28:08| that we dealt with two weeks ago that are not on Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| Have we added all those back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| If they're city parks, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| If they're not city parks, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| Are they all city parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8899)|
| 2:28:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| Ten Mile Creek, Greenway Park, and Turkey Creek Conservation Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8904)|
| 2:28:29| I don't know if those are city parks or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| I don't know either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| I can't answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8916)|
| 2:28:37| It's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8922)|
| 2:28:43| I return to my proposition that we add Joe's suggestion, all city parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8923)|
| 2:28:48| and Mr. McAdams' suggestion, all city parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| and that we then leave this list of eight and put at the bottom of it plus those on Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8930)|
| 2:28:57| We say all city parks, including but not limited to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| We're trying as an attempt to make an enumeration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| but we're saying if there's one we missed, it's in there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| And so the list is an illustration of our thought process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| but not an attempt to exclude a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| And I think that's a healthy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8957)|
| 2:29:18| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| I guess I don't want to belabor the point, but we're passing a law, Mr. DellaVolpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8960)|
| 2:29:26| and to say in a law, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| it's illegal for you to run red lights at these intersections and any others doesn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8969)|
| 2:29:37| it sort of feels a little, you know, it sort of feels a little funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| We are making law here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| This is not a recommendation to MPC to correct language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| So I'm comfortable with what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| So we don't know, but, well, I'm comfortable enough to go along with it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| And I guess I'm wondering if we could put language in there someplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| that would say the intent of this is to maintain overlays, although we're making a law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| we can't say the intent is to maintain overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| We're changing a zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| In effect, we're going to a piece of law here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9008)|
| 2:30:11| and we are saying Ledgerwood Park is currently zoned something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| We don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9015)|
| 2:30:16| We are changing it to a specific thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| And that scares me because Ledgerwood Park could be zoned, you know, A1, IH1 overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9019)|
| 2:30:27| and we're eliminating the IH1 overlay, and I don't feel comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| We could be doing that with historic overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| It doesn't feel we're making law here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9035)|
| 2:30:39| This is not a – it doesn't feel right to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9039)|
| 2:30:43| And I'm not sure how we fix this on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9043)|
| 2:30:48| And, Mr. Donaldson, I don't know if you have some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| Is it possible to come back – no, not Mr. Donaldson, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| When in two weeks will we have a list that says this whole list here on A is moving from –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9055)|
| 2:31:05| Adair Park is moving from this zone to this zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| and Alex Haley Heritage Park is moving from this zone to this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| Can we get that list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| And I guess that is for both Mr. Swanson and Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| Because we are making law, and I'd like to know what we're eliminating as well as what we're adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| Because it might actually not be as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| I can't get you that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| We have that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| So it is possible to have that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| And, Mr. Swanson, is it possible to incorporate that list into what we're doing here next in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9092)|
| 2:31:41| In two weeks, when you have that list, can you incorporate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9105)|
| 2:31:46| Without it being a substantive change, maybe, is what –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| We can deal with that on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9108)|
| 2:31:50| I just want to make sure we can put that in, that we will know when we adopt this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| You can, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| There's a procedure for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| Okay, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| I think Vice Mayor Becker's comments go back to my original reluctance to support the First Amendment that has already passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9120)|
| 2:32:07| and that is trying to cram a square peg in a round hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| OS1 has limitations, as it is written, and it may be nullifying some of the overlay zonings that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9132)|
| 2:32:22| And I just think that we are not proceeding with prudent caution in trying to make all this fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9142)|
| 2:32:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9153)|
| 2:32:34| Everybody understand the motion that's on the floor right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9154)|

| 2:32:40| The amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9160)|
| 2:32:41| It's on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9161)|

| 2:35:36| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| I applaud Councilwoman Roddy's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9337)|
| 2:35:40| Withdrew then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| No, she didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9341)|
| 2:35:42| No, she didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| It was a different one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| Different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| This is still on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| Go ahead, Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| I applaud Councilman Roddy's move to do this because there have been some questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| notifying people when zoning things are going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| However, I don't think 12 days is quite enough time and I'd like to amend this to read 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9357)|
| 2:36:02| days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| There's a motion to amend to 20 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| Is there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9368)|
| 2:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9369)|
| 2:36:10| Mr. Donaldson seems to want to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| This would qualify as an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and as such it requires a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9373)|
| 2:36:19| recommendation from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9379)|
| 2:36:22| Yeah, it's got to go to the Planning Commission to be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9382)|
| 2:36:28| So the proper motion here is to refer this to the Metropolitan Planning Commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9388)|
| 2:36:34| their review and recommendation to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9394)|
| 2:36:40| You can amend it before you send it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| There's no reason why you can't amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| I'm going to stick to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| And then the proper motion will be to refer this to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9407)|
| 2:36:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9413)|
| 2:36:54| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9414)|
| 2:36:55| I guess we're just speaking to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9418)|
| 2:36:59| I don't have anything to speak to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9419)|
| 2:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9420)|
| 2:37:01| Mr. DelVolpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| Just the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9422)|
| 2:37:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9423)|
| 2:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9424)|
| 2:37:05| Mr. Becker, anything on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9425)|
| 2:37:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9426)|
| 2:37:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9427)|
| 2:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| Now back to the motion as amended, I guess, would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9431)|
| 2:37:12| I guess back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| We'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9434)|
| 2:37:15| We'll vote on the motion to amend right now then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9438)|
| 2:37:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9439)|
| 2:37:20| All those in favor of amending, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9440)|
| 2:37:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9442)|
| 2:37:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9443)|
| 2:37:24| Motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9444)|
| 2:37:25| Now back as amended to any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| Now, Mr. DelVolpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9449)|
| 2:37:30| I guess my concern here is that when we talk about general zoning matters in this proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9450)|
| 2:37:40| ordinance, it is not clear to me what cost we are going to incur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| When we take a lot on Smith Street, we can identify the people within so many hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9465)|
| 2:37:51| feet of that and make sure they get a postcard in the mail as well as the signs on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9471)|
| 2:37:57| When we change a general zoning ordinance, where is it that we – how do we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9477)|
| 2:38:03| derive the list and how do we mail it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9483)|
| 2:38:06| And haven't we built in a pitfall that we can never satisfy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9486)|
| 2:38:10| I'm concerned, one, about the cost and, two, whether this is doable if we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9490)|
| 2:38:16| an across-the-board zoning change that affects every area of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9496)|
| 2:38:22| How do you give individualized notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9502)|
| 2:38:25| So I guess I want some clarification on that because I'm not sure what is the problem we are attacking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9505)|
| 2:38:30| and I want to be sure I understand that and what it costs us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9510)|
| 2:38:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9515)|
| 2:38:36| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9518)|
| 2:38:39| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9519)|
| 2:38:40| I guess I will admit to some ignorance on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9520)|
| 2:38:43| I actually had seen this on the draft, and it was a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9523)|
| 2:38:46| And when – online, there was originally a resolution doing this, or at least it was called 11G as opposed to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9526)|
| 2:38:54| And I did not notice it until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| So I've got a question I would have asked Mr. Donaldson today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| What's the current – because I know – and I guess, Mr. DellaVolpe, I think, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9539)|
| 2:39:06| a general rezoning is what we would say – Oakwood, Lincoln Park, this is one I'm very familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9546)|
| 2:39:12| We generally rezoned Oakwood, Lincoln Park with very defined boundaries to put the infill housing overlay on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9552)|
| 2:39:19| That's a general rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9559)|
| 2:39:20| It is not creating a new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| It actually does have geographic parameters to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| So it is clear – it is not that difficult to find all the addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9565)|
| 2:39:30| And I guess, Mr. Donaldson, I know when we did that one, there was a lot of public outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9570)|
| 2:39:36| Was something mailed to everybody in Oakwood, Lincoln Park when we did the infill housing overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9576)|
| 2:39:42| What's generally the MPC policy right now on this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9582)|
| 2:39:50| Generally, if it's an initiative by us, we'll send out a postcard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9590)|
| 2:39:56| That's different than first-class mail, so the cost can be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9596)|
| 2:40:03| One example that I'm familiar with is my neighborhood was rezoned from R1 to EN1, and there were 1,000 parcels in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9603)|
| 2:40:14| So the cost of a first-class letter to every property owner could run towards $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9614)|
| 2:40:24| by the time we factor in some staff time to manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| We have that data available to us through KGIS, and we can literally draw a boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| and it prints out all of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| And is that – do we do that now on a regular basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9635)|
| 2:40:39| Or is it – is this something like this currently codified within MPC's operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9639)|
| 2:40:48| Currently codified within the city's zoning ordinance is an exemption for general rezonings from the mailing notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9648)|
| 2:40:57| That Article 7, Section 6B2 literally says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9657)|
| 2:41:02| Notification by mail shall not be required in cases of general amendments to the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9662)|
| 2:41:08| And we have mimicked that language in our administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9668)|
| 2:41:14| I guess, Ms. Roddy, the question for you, the first-class mail actually worries me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9674)|
| 2:41:20| I'm actually more likely to see something that's on a postcard than a first-class mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9680)|
| 2:41:25| because first-class mail involves opening it, unfolding it, and that's where postcard is just flip it over, and it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9685)|
| 2:41:32| And I'm wondering – this is obviously something that would have to go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| but my sense is almost a better contact would be postcard as opposed to first-class mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9695)|
| 2:41:41| and I don't know what your thinking would be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9701)|
| 2:41:47| Anybody? Okay, Ms. Roddy, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9709)|
| 2:41:50| A couple questions have been asked about this ordinance that I brought to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| One is from Mr. Della Volpe, curious about who this might affect and what the adverse consequences might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9714)|
| 2:42:00| And, Mayor, did anybody sign up to speak to this tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9723)|
| 2:42:04| There is somebody in the audience that has had some personal experience with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9724)|
| 2:42:07| and if they are willing to speak, they might be willing to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| Secondly, Vice Mayor Becker, I guess I would have to contact the post office to find out the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9730)|
| 2:42:16| My sense is with a postcard, first-class mail is handled differently in terms of forwarding, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9736)|
| 2:42:25| So if there is an address that has changed recently, non-first-class mail is not forwarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9745)|
| 2:42:34| And my intent here is to make certain that notice gets to the property owner whose property is going to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9754)|
| 2:42:42| And I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| If you own a piece of property, that you understand what your government is intending to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9764)|
| 2:42:49| Ninety-nine percent of the time, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| It's an overlay that's adding protection to your property, and we hope that everyone is good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9772)|
| 2:42:57| But in one percent of the time, maybe there's some questions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| and if that notification doesn't get to the owner property properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| then I feel like it's our fault in government that we didn't get it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9784)|
| 2:43:09| Is there anybody that would like to speak to this that's been affected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9789)|
| 2:43:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9793)|
| 2:43:14| If you'd just come real quickly and give us your name and address, anything you'd like to say real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9794)|
| 2:43:21| Thank you, Mr. Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| I'm Lindsay McDonough, 2135 Lyons Bend Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9803)|
| 2:43:29| I'm vice president of the Aslan Foundation, a local charitable foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9809)|
| 2:43:35| In 2008, we purchased about 95 acres, which you've heard a lot about recently, known as Log Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9815)|
| 2:43:44| And since then, we have added several contiguous parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| It is our intention to preserve the historical and aesthetic value of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9828)|
| 2:43:55| but we have not yet decided exactly what the use of the property will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9835)|
| 2:44:00| We were surprised to find out about a month ago that Log Haven was included in a list of city parks to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9840)|
| 2:44:09| We found out about it only because my husband is an avid reader of newspapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9849)|
| 2:44:15| and he read an account of the MPC meeting in the Bearden Shopper News.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9855)|
| 2:44:22| We did not receive any notice by mail or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| There were no signs posted, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| And I don't think it was anyone's intention to include privately owned property in a list of city parks to be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9871)|
| 2:44:41| but because there was no notice to us of the matter before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9881)|
| 2:44:47| the problem was not discovered until relatively late in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9887)|
| 2:44:53| And it might never have been discovered at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| We would like to have had notice of any proposed rezoning of Log Haven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9897)|
| 2:45:03| which would have saved some of council's time as well as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9903)|
| 2:45:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9908)|
| 2:45:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9909)|
| 2:45:10| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9910)|
| 2:45:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| Mr. Del Bocchi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9912)|
| 2:45:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| That answers part of my question, and I appreciate this woman's concern and discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| and it's obviously a good use of that to get advance notice in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9919)|
| 2:45:24| My concern is this, and I'm going to ask it to Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| I attended some of the meetings, for example, on the hilltop and ridge protection rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9927)|
| 2:45:33| And, of course, that's just a plan and it's not a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| It doesn't change a single zone in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| But if we were confronted with a zoning change to protect hilltops or ridges or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9939)|
| 2:45:45| so that, I don't know, KUB wouldn't build a tower or someone else wouldn't do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9945)|
| 2:45:49| without some process to evaluate the aesthetics and the impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9949)|
| 2:45:54| and we're confronted with adopting a general zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| do you have to go to the computer system, the KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9957)|
| 2:46:01| and identify every property owner with a slope more than 15 degrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| and send them a 20-day advance letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| I mean, is that one of the consequences of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| I heard a number thrown out at that particular meeting that it would cost $60,000 to $100,000 to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9970)|
| 2:46:15| which sounds like a tremendous waste of public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| I'd rather see us publish a full-page insert in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9978)|
| 2:46:22| So are we covering that or are we just talking about specific general zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9982)|
| 2:46:27| that affect a specific piece of property like that young lady was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9987)|
| 2:46:32| rezoning it from whatever it was to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9992)|
| 2:46:36| In the case of the hillside and ridge top protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=9996)|
| 2:46:40| if we were to adopt the geography that we've been talking about as an overlay zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| that would be considered a general rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| and we've identified 62,000 parcels that are within that geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10009)|
| 2:46:56| So if you send them a simple postcard, it would be on the order of $17,000 or $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10016)|
| 2:47:02| And then there are the people that are immediately adjacent to that geography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10022)|
| 2:47:07| that might be interested in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| So we could very easily literally send a postcard to every parcel in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10029)|
| 2:47:20| Where does that money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| Do we end up saying, oh, here's another $50,000, send a postcard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10041)|
| 2:47:26| Where does the money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| That would be an unfunded mandate basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| Since a general rezoning is usually initiated by council or the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10052)|
| 2:47:38| there is no applicant to pay a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10058)|
| 2:47:42| So we absorb that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| So I guess I'm concerned that this might be overbroad in some sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10064)|
| 2:47:49| or at least have consequences that we don't right now intend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| I can see where we have a specific property owner or area being affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| that getting a good notice out is a healthy thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10077)|
| 2:48:00| but if we're going to start having some types of general zones that require us to go through lots of hurdles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10080)|
| 2:48:06| that we probably will screw up somehow and we'll be in a court someday with Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10086)|
| 2:48:11| arguing why we gave the proper notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| But I want to be careful that we don't have an unintended consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| I understand this is on the first reading, and so I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10097)|
| 2:48:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10102)|
| 2:48:23| No discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| All those in favor of calling the question on that, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10110)|
| 2:48:31| Better run that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10115)|
| 2:48:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10118)|
| 2:48:39| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10119)|
| 2:48:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10120)|
| 2:48:41| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10122)|
| 2:48:43| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10123)|
| 2:48:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10124)|
| 2:48:45| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10126)|
| 2:48:47| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10127)|
| 2:48:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10128)|
| 2:48:49| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10129)|
| 2:48:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10132)|
| 2:48:53| I have that it passes five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10133)|
| 2:48:54| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10134)|
| 2:48:55| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10135)|
| 2:48:56| So the question is called on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| The question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10141)|
| 2:49:04| Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10144)|
| 2:49:05| We did the 20 days, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| We did the 20 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10147)|
| 2:49:08| But that's not an appropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| You can't approve this on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| You've got to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10153)|
| 2:49:16| I mean, this is not something that you can consider before it's been considered by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10156)|
| 2:49:20| So the appropriate motion that needs to be made if somebody is going to make it is to send it to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10160)|
| 2:49:26| with their review and recommendations to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10166)|
| 2:49:31| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10171)|
| 2:49:32| Well, hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| So now we've actually called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| Somebody will have to help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| We've actually called the question on what's an appropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10176)|
| 2:49:44| The thing to do right now is to, because there's a call for a question that's an inappropriate question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10184)|
| 2:49:51| the thing to do now is to ask whether or not someone wishes to move to refer this to MPC for their review and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10191)|
| 2:50:02| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10202)|
| 2:50:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| Now, you as the presiding officer need to determine whether the called question deals with that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10205)|
| 2:50:12| or whether that dealt with the previous improper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10212)|
| 2:50:15| Can I withdraw my motion to call the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10215)|
| 2:50:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10219)|
| 2:50:20| Unfortunately, we've already voted on, so he can't really withdraw it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10220)|
| 2:50:24| But as a chair, I can say it was an inappropriate motion and we can go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10228)|
| 2:50:29| As a chair, I say, unfortunately, that was an inappropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| Otherwise, we're going to be here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10231)|
| 2:50:34| I'm trying to get us out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10234)|
| 2:50:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10236)|
| 2:50:37| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10237)|
| 2:50:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10238)|
| 2:50:39| So now, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10239)|
| 2:50:40| Now, did somebody, we need the new motion on the floor to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10240)|
| 2:50:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10244)|
| 2:50:45| And was there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10246)|
| 2:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10247)|
| 2:50:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10248)|
| 2:50:49| We need the new motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10249)|
| 2:50:50| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10250)|
| 2:50:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10251)|
| 2:50:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10252)|
| 2:50:53| The motion is to refer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| This is a bizarre concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10254)|
| 2:50:55| And, you know, at 930 at night, it's probably not good to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10255)|
| 2:50:59| But when Mr. DellaVolpe was talking, I did think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10259)|
| 2:51:02| And it's kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10262)|
| 2:51:03| One of the challenges, the thing I would have said about the R4 discussion that I didn't get because we called off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10263)|
| 2:51:09| was what Mr. DellaVolpe was talking about, how MPC did this, that, and the other, and I'm mad about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10269)|
| 2:51:15| MPC doesn't decide these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| And I'm wondering, we sort of have a challenge here of who pays for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| We're requiring MPC to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| Mr. Donaldson just sort of called in an unfunded mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| And keep in mind that all MPC is going to do on a general rezoning is make a recommendation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10287)|
| 2:51:33| So, actually, maybe what we ought to think about is changing this to say not less than 20 days before a city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10293)|
| 2:51:43| city council shall notify all people of a general rezoning because we're actually the people who decide this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10303)|
| 2:51:49| MPC just makes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| That actually moves the process quicker because it doesn't have to go to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| And it lands that question of how do we pay for this thing squarely where it belongs, which is in our lap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10315)|
| 2:52:01| So I don't know, Mr. Swanson, if there's a motion to be made on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10321)|
| 2:52:07| I don't think there is because there's a motion to refer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| But it feels like maybe a better way to make sure that the public is notified about the decisions of city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10329)|
| 2:52:18| is to have city council tell them that we're making that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10338)|
| 2:52:23| I don't, so, hmm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| Yeah, who's sending out those envelopes, Andy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10346)|
| 2:52:29| Oh, I think it's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10349)|
| 2:52:34| But somebody someplace is sending out those envelopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10354)|
| 2:52:37| And, again, it feels like what we've done is we're going to ask somebody else to send out those envelopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10357)|
| 2:52:43| So, and that's, again, I thought at 930 at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10363)|
| 2:52:48| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10368)|
| 2:52:49| This is a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10369)|
| 2:52:51| When there is about to be a zoning change and you send out current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| who sends out the postcards that there's going to be a hearing to change the zoning on a piece of property right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10375)|
| 2:53:03| MPC does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| Would this be different than what MPC currently does other than we're asking for a letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10385)|
| 2:53:13| Well, for a general rezoning, we don't send out, we're not required to send out notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10393)|
| 2:53:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10398)|
| 2:53:19| Through the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10399)|
| 2:53:20| But only for a specific rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10402)|
| 2:53:23| And then we get an application fee for that, which defrays the cost of postage and other notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10403)|
| 2:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10409)|
| 2:53:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10410)|
| 2:53:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10411)|
| 2:53:32| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10414)|
| 2:53:35| As the sponsor of this ordinance, I guess I would like to express my support for it in its original format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10415)|
| 2:53:41| I forgot, Mr. Swanson, when I asked you to draw up this ordinance, that it was merely a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10421)|
| 2:53:47| And we never put that language on there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| It just comes up as an ordinance, but then in the process of discussion, then the maker of the motion makes the motion to refer it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10429)|
| 2:53:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| It needed to be an ordinance because you're changing the code, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| You're changing the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10443)|
| 2:54:04| So it needed to be an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| But we don't have the power to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| You don't have the power to change it until you first send it to MPC for their review and recommendations, which are then sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10448)|
| 2:54:16| And that is the motion that we currently have on the floor now, is the referral motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10456)|
| 2:54:20| Is a referral motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10460)|
| 2:54:22| As the sponsor of the original ordinance, I would like to express my support for a referral in the format that it was presented tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10462)|
| 2:54:33| Meaning the 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10473)|
| 2:54:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10476)|
| 2:54:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| Falls in your court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10483)|
| 2:54:44| It's time to vote on a motion to refer it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10487)|
| 2:54:48| I think that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10488)|
| 2:54:49| The motion on the floor is to refer it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10491)|
| 2:54:52| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10492)|
| 2:54:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10493)|
| 2:54:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10496)|
| 2:54:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10497)|
| 2:54:58| We do have one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10498)|
| 2:55:00| Dan Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10500)|
| 2:55:08| Name and address are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| I see most people are gone, but counsel is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10510)|
| 2:55:14| By the way, vice mayor, it's 9.58, not 9.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10514)|
| 2:55:20| Ordinarily I wouldn't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10520)|
| 2:55:24| And fortunately I've had a few minutes to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10524)|
| 2:55:27| I'm going to chalk up your action on the R4MU1 personally as the fact that your computers didn't work the same as mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10527)|
| 2:55:41| And that it was not that you missed the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| On my computer, when you click on the blue box on the agenda, you get the whole package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10544)|
| 2:55:50| You got the MPC stuff and you got the NAC thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10550)|
| 2:55:55| And that was there for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| It's because it's part of a package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| One is not in opposition to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10559)|
| 2:56:02| But I don't think you got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10562)|
| 2:56:08| And it's already come up when we were discussing this with the NAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10568)|
| 2:56:14| And by the way, I appreciate people saying about the nine hours and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10574)|
| 2:56:20| And I frankly, given my current state of employment, I don't mind the nine hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10580)|
| 2:56:26| And it was a good lesson learned in terms of what we should do with our time in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10586)|
| 2:56:36| But it came up from one of the members of the NAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10596)|
| 2:56:40| And it also came up from Mr. Donaldson with regard to here is a situation right now where this particular ordinance would be a perfect thing rather than going from R to O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10600)|
| 2:56:55| And just based on this information and based on how fast things move in our city, it will come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10615)|
| 2:57:05| Maybe while some of you are still in office that this would have been something to move forward on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10625)|
| 2:57:11| The other thing I wanted to mention on a lighter note to the Vice Mayor is that when you were apologizing to Mr. Swanson about giving him additional work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10631)|
| 2:57:25| I have never met an attorney who was unhappy to have billable hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10645)|
| 2:57:33| Now, maybe Mr. Swanson, are you doing this pro bono?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| Thank you all. We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=10661)|
