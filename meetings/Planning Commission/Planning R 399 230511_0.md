| 0:11:03| Okay, so we're going to entertain a motion to approve the consent list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| with the exception of items 17, 18, and 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| Do I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Motion to approve as read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Hang on one second, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Mr. Chairman, when you've read this, you said item number 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| In the list, I'm seeing 6.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Let me look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Okay, I'll correct that by saying item 6.1, land development solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| Correct it from what I previously stated as item 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| And for the record, Chairman Hill has already indicated recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Are there any other recusals for the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| All right, so we have a motion by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| And where was my second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| We had a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=717)|

| 0:11:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| First item on the agenda is item number 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| The applicant is Crescent Bend Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| location north side of Central Avenue Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| at the northern terminus of Murray Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| 91.24 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| Present zoning, general agricultural and hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| Zoning requested, RN6 multifamily residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| and hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Approve RN6 and hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| because it is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| and compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Seeing no opposition, would you like to proceed, Mr. Applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| and state your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| Here on behalf of the applicant, Crescent Bend Development, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| instant request is to rezone the property to RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| Prior to filing, we took time and met with planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| to talk about the property, discuss the proposed development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| for the property and use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Following their guidance and advice, we submitted for the RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| As you'll notice, a substantial portion of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| is subject to the hillside protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| and it has several, based on the grade, undisturbable areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| The reason for the RN6 is it's not the density needed for the RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| It's the RN5 height limitations of 35 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| in order to get a three-story apartment in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Based on how it's measured from ground to roof pitch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| you exceed the three-story, the 35-foot maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| What makes this property appropriate and suitable and attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| for multifamily development is its location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| and how it's situated between two interstate interchanges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| You have one to the north at Callahan Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| and then one to the south at Mergence Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| That will alleviate traffic congestion and assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| in dispersing the traffic to and from the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| We've been in conversations with Legacy Parks with this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| positive conversations of donating a significant portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| of the property to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| The discussions or thoughts are that a trail system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| could be established there as a public amenity for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| My client's committed to see that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| Again, RN6, minor extension of the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| with the property to the south being adjacent zoned RN6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| complies with the North City Sector Plan's mixed-use specialty district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| as well as the growth policy plan and general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| We'd ask that you approve the rezoning request to RN6 hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Councillor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Mr. Forrester, on the area that you might transfer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| for conservation purposes, will there be access to that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| There would be access from Central Avenue Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| either through our development or a separate access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| adjacent to our development but on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| And those have been the discussions with Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| of creating that access road and then parking area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| So that area would be kind of the backside of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| where the railroad line is, kind of across the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| I think it's approximately 17 acres is what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| and that was an attractive number to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| Motion to approve RN6 multifamily residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=985)|

| 0:17:24| Approximate acreage, 70.68 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| Zoning is RN2 and hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| Existing land use, agricultural forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Number of lots, 290.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| And this will require two variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| and alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1073)|

| 0:18:19| We're present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Would you like to defer, Councilor Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| We were here on this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Of course, this is a subdivision concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| for a little over 70.6 acres, 290 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| which breaks down to about 4.2 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| And in comparison, the closest subdivision there is Buffett Trace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| It has 83 units and 14.5 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| which is about 5.7 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| and they're attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Staff's recommending this approval subject to 14 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| We were here last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| It was deferred so we'd have a chance to meet with the neighborhood out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| and we were able to meet on May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| Had a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Mr. Collins was able to organize it at a local church there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| I guess we had over 30 people that was at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| and we talked about these issues for over two hours and some of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| And as a result of that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| there are a couple of concessions that were really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| to many of the neighbors that were able to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| So I guess we would like to add two conditions to the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| as part of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| One, there was a lot of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| In our plan, there is a greenway trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| There's internal sidewalks on one side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| so there's plenty of pedestrian opportunities in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| But the greenway that goes all around the perimeter of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| there are concerns about how close that got to some of the existing residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| and how that may require some more disturbance and less vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| which would affect privacy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| And so we agreed we would just take the greenway trails around the perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| off the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| I think it would be a good amenity for the people that live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| but if the neighbors have a concern about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| we're willing to remove that from the plan altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| There's also some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| We're trying to keep as much of the existing vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| along the perimeter as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| but there's some areas because of the topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| that will have to be disturbed and graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| And we've agreed that whatever we disturb and grade along that perimeter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| we'll go back and revegetate to add some more greenery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| and try to reestablish some of the privacy that they enjoy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| I have a very rudimentary drawing kind of as to what that would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| I only have one copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| I'll give it to Ms. Cannon and put it in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| But we would ask that this be conditioned upon us submitting a plan to the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1255)|
| 0:21:03| for their approval administratively for the revegetation of those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| to make sure that we are going to do what we say we do on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| as we go through permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| But with that, there may still be some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| We talked a lot about traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| and there's a traffic impact analysis in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| And they didn't recommend any improvements to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| We know that traffic is an issue out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| It's an issue before we came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| It's going to be an issue after we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| But traffic impact analysis says you're still going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| within the existing level of service that is already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| with the current traffic issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| and we can't obviously solve the problems that are existing there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| So with all of that, I'd ask you to follow staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| with the modification for the two conditions that I've mentioned here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| and that you vote to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| And I'll reserve any time I have left to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| or address anything that the other speakers may bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Thank you, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Mr. Ronnie Collins, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1323)|
| 0:22:12| Well, I was going to say, because, you know, last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| Mr. Mullins, I did ask you all to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| and meet with the Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| I have had a chance to talk with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| I appreciate you all doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| And I think the work that's reflected in the two additional amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| that came forward is what happens when community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| and development works together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| And I want to thank all of the neighborhood associations out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| for caring about their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| So with that, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| I move to approve the requested variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Wait just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| I thought I saw a hand from Mr. Collins that wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| We have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1373)|
| 0:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Those that would like to speak, if you'd come near the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1387)|
| 0:23:29| So I think our opposition spoke last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| And would like to speak again this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| And if it's I'm going to defer to our commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| You guys okay with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| I'm Damon Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| I'm at a 50 20 Starbuck lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| Property that's connected to the bottom curve down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| The only thing I have concerns for is we haven't seen what the landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| And the current rough draft that he's got right now shows that the land in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| front of my property is going to be graded down and all the visitation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| going to be tucked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| So I'm a little bit leery on that to see what all is going to be put back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| in its place to get back to privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| And of course there's no plans for the grading that I've seen for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| As far as traffic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| It was brought up in the meeting that the railroad crossing at Lowe's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Creek was not part of the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| I think that's kind of a bad thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| because it does cause a big choke point during some parts of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| because you have Spring Hill backs up due to the train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| And that's the only way you can get to privilege Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| So that's the only other concern I really have on like the traffic in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| And I would probably recommend if this goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| we got to do something with Spring Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| especially the coming up the hill part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| So I've seen so many cars go off that road into a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| If there was a way we can maybe perhaps widen it just a little bit to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| people from going off into the ditches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| especially in the winter time, that would probably be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| I know as far as the property itself, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| I know on my side, I was kind of hope, but they bring water with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| But I was hoping to have like maybe a fence put up to help with privacy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| sound issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Because right now you can hear that train that's over on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| So loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| It's like an amphitheater in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| So I do have some concerns about the sound and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| but that's all I've got as far as concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| So I'll go ahead and reserve my time just in case there's anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Thanks for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Do we have any other in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1548)|
| 0:25:58| Ronnie Collins, president of Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| 4606 Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| I basically just wanted to thank you all for the postponement last night to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| have a chance to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| The two major concerns he showed in their new concept was to walk and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| trail in the vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| So that was something great to come out of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| I guess the biggest concern I had to add to anything was during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| It says there's a minimum traffic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| I talked to Tom Clabo, chief director of city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| and 290 units puts 10,000 more vehicles or traffic in the area per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1600)|
| 0:26:49| And I don't know how 10,000 more traffic can be a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| And the other was, I believe it came out, out of three schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| they were expecting 79 students for three different between elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| middle, and high school, 79 in the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| I don't know who's doing these studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| but if you're building 290 houses and only expect 79 school children to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| in there, something don't match in my idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| So that's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you, Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| So, and Ronnie, I'll address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Because I've asked that question before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| The school system actually gives a lot of those student yields back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| So that comes from KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| That's where those come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| So probably something we probably do need to address with them to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| they're looking at their formulas right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| because it's something else that we've had some concern about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| But with that, before I make my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| I do want to ask, based on the gentleman that lives right next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| can we request the city engineering just to look at the Springfield Buffet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| meal to make sure the curbs are wide enough so when cars are turning so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| they're not going off in the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Not part of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| but just something that we can request of city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| So with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| I now move to approve the requested variance and alternative design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| standards based on the justification provided by the applicant and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| recommended by the city of Knoxville Department of Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| including the two that the applicant brought today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| which is a removement of the greenway as number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| and then fixing any disturbed existing vegetation as condition number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1707)|
| 0:28:37| OK, we have a motion by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| That's for the first motion to approve the variance and alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| I think the condition should be added to the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Wherever you would like them put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Those two conditions would be condition 15 and condition 16 as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Will you modify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Take that off and we'll address it on the second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| You good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| And you good with that as a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| OK, so we've got a first, a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| Maybe Mr. Reynolds can help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| The greenway path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| was this planned to be public or only for the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| Mr. Mullins, can you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| I don't believe we restricted it in either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| And there's still a right-of-way that's remaining open as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| concept plan, I think, to Monta Vista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| That was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| there's some opportunity there with the internal sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| I don't know if we had restricted the greenway path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| whether it was open to the public or private one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| So when you guys met with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| did they understand that to be either a public amenity or is that understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| I think they understood that it would put a walking path right along their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| property line in their backyards and didn't want people walking by their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| backyards in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| So my point is that I think that the greenway trail was a really great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| public amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| And I don't know if maybe it was communicated right that it could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| been for the entire public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| But I am not a fan of seeing it disappear, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| if it goes behind a few properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| Looking at the properties, it goes behind them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| and you've got some landscaping buffers still on some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| But I'd like to see that stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| I guess we can address that on the second motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| would that be appropriate to address that on the second motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| So let's go ahead and work on this first motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| which is the requested variance and alternative design standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| So let's move on to Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| Did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| I can wait until after the variance vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Then let's go with Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| So I guess we're all good now on this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Seeing no other lights for this particular topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Chairman, with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| I'll make my original motion to approve the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| knowing there's going to be some discussion subject to now 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| adding number 15 as the neighborhood recommended of removing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| So as not to restrict any privacy for homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| And then number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| fixing any disturb the vegetation back to kind of its existing nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| to preserve that longstanding vegetation in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| That second one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| that'd be number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I wrote down five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| It's six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Whatever time of day it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| So we have a motion to approve the concept plan subject to 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| conditions as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| As just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Did we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Commissioner all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| OK, so let's go with commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| I want to express that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| I concur with commissioner shell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| So don't want to see that greenway disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| And it does represent a positive amenity for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| At large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| And I'm not sure exactly how about the communication either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| So I don't want to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| OK, commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| And that's the other thing I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| And also pointing out that the majority of the greenway is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| the side of the property that doesn't have individual houses next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| There are portions that go behind individual houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| but as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| she also said that there's still a landscape buffer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| And I think as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| we very frequently talk about activity and walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| I know that there's a sidewalk here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| but one of the biggest complaints with our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| or an issue that we see in our society is people not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| opportunities to walk and exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| And a sidewalk is one thing, but a greenway like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| if you've got kids, I have young kids myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| And if I were to live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| I would not want to walk them around on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| I would want to walk and let them play along the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| And we're talking about 290 homes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| I bet there's going to be some kids here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| So I agree that I don't think that's a wise decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| I can't support that aspect or that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| Vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| Thank you, chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| I just wanted to take Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Mullins up on his offering to submit that exhibit for the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| condition number 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| just so as staff and engineering can be clear on where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| vegetative buffer repurposing would be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| It's not a blanket that people aren't clear on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Can we hear from the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| He's got his hand up back there on the green. Mr. Reed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| would you like to come up? I think ordinarily we, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| we keep this within discussion here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| but we did bring up kind of a new condition here and he may be most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| So I think it's appropriate to hear from him. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| I'd just like to point out that loves Creek has a park within walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| distance of the new subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| So the ability to have children play and walk in a safe environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| would be still available to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| The only thing that would be a detriment to the subdivision is putting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| the walkaway because you'd have all kinds of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| It'll give new entrances to people that don't live in the community into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| You can cause a higher crime rate because people can disappear into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| woods easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| I think that was the main concern the group had about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| Plus it being right in their back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| And if you have been in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| you have noticed an increase in the homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| I myself have seen a guy basically either on drugs or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| down at the railroad crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| playing on railroad tracks and called the authorities to have him removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| from the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| And when you kill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| I would like to see the provision stay in there to remove the walk path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| due to the park band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| So close to the subdivision and as the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| we all kind of agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| even the developer that that would be in the best interest in having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| It'd be a amenity to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| It wouldn't be anything took away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| But just wanted to thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| I think historically there's evidence out there that's been studied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| several years that Greenway's actually had value to properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| Also on the issue of any crime issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| That's generally not a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| not an issue on most Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| So I'm like with my cohorts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| I would like to see it stayed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| I'll support keeping it in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| but won't approve taking it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| I just have a quick housekeeping item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| the staff report accidentally messed up on the number numbering of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| which was supposed to be 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I accidentally put number four twice and I corrected it in my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| personal print here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| but I did not add it to the agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| So there's 15 conditions that we add to that would be 16 and 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| So we'll just a minor correction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| There are actually 17 conditions just because the report was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| misnumbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| So everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| you're good with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| So we have a motion and a second for the 17 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| Approve the concept plan subject to 17 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| All in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| I think we better call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2242)|

| 0:38:05| And eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2286)|

| 0:38:09| Six to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| One, two, three, four, five, six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| One, two, three, four, five, six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Six, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Chair will entertain another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| I'll go ahead and make a motion to approve the concept plan subject to 16 conditions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2294)|
| 0:38:27| the additional one not in the staff report being to revegetate the perimeter of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| as presented in a newly obtained exhibit somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Maybe I didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| So start over if you would on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| I thought we were dealing with the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| So the concept plan as presented has the greenway in it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| So it's just adding this revegetative perimeter condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| So 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| This is approve the concept plan subject to the 16 conditions that you have uniquely noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| We have Commissioner Huber seconding the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| We have Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| And I just mostly want to caution this body because last month we asked for a 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| The neighborhood went back with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| The neighborhood, not the developer, but the neighborhood specifically asked for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| to be taken out because of an area they live in, knowing the homeless population, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| of the drug population going on in that area, how wooded and forested it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| I lived in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| A lot of entrance points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| I think we need to be careful not to dismiss when a neighborhood works with a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| to come up with something that they feel is safe for their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| But just because we think it might be good amenity when there is a park across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| That's my only feedback as you all are doing this because I think it's setting a very dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| precedence for us to just say to local communities, we don't care what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| We're going to do whatever we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| And that's not getting the community involved, which is what we need right this minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| I just wanted to point out that there's two conditions that are somewhat sidewalk related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| in the staff report dealing with the connection to Monta Vista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| There's not a condition of installing the trail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| It is recognized that the trail is on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| They can install the trail if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| There is not a condition to require the trail to be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| So if you want to require it, I would suggest conditioning it upon installing the trail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2452)|
| 0:41:01| Or you could just leave it as is as an optional installation where the developer could still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| choose not to install it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| But basically, it wouldn't be a condition that they can't install it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| It would be still their option to install it or not install it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| I'll amend my motion that raises other questions I have about the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| What can be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| Maybe we can talk about that another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| But I'll make it a condition to keep the greenway as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| So we have a motion by Commissioner Schell, so seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| This is an interesting deliberation here where we have a community and a developer agreeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| on certain conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| It's challenging for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Is there a greater good or do we defer to the community and the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2522)|

| 0:46:04| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| I'm Sarah McGowan with the GPD Group representing Taco Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| If you could state your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| It's 520 South Main Street, Suite 2531 Akron, Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| We have a number of people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| We'd like to defer to hear the public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| And let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Let's start with Roderick Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2802)|
| 0:46:56| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| I'm Roderick Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| I'm the proprietor of Calloway's Lamp and Shade located at 5714 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| Calloway's has always been a fixture in Bearden since 1946.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| Bearden has grown and changed significantly in that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| However, the unique personality of our village is still very much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| Historic Bearden is known for art, fashion, design, and cuisine, not to mention a very beautiful elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2836)|
| 0:47:24| which I once attended when I was much younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| That being the case, the traffic between North Shore and Sutherland Avenue is already considerably congested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| causing traffic to back up in the exact location of this proposed Taco Bell, especially when schools let out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| I don't know if you've been there stuck in that traffic when you can't even get in the right lane because everyone's picking their kid up at Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2861)|
| 0:47:49| But this is particularly detrimental to the surrounding small businesses like mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| I don't know about you, but I try to avoid high traffic areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| There are plenty of scenic routes surrounding Bearden that I'd much rather look at than staring at taillights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| Many of my customers feel that same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| I know that because they plan their trips to my store when it's more convenient because there's less traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| They typically don't like coming on Fridays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| As such, I'm extremely concerned that our sales will be negatively impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| Please understand if our sales decrease, so do the number of people I am able to employ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| So my main complaint is I ask you, is it really necessary for us to have another fast food chain right there in the heart of Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2905)|
| 0:48:33| right where it's a high traffic area already, when you can go two miles down the road to get your Taco Bell fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| I call on this committee to deny the request for Taco Bell to be built at 5613 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| Thank you, Mr. Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Leslie Gordon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| I'm Leslie Gordon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| My address is 116 Westwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| I would like to ask the commissioners if you would consider giving us more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| We are not a coordinated group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| We are several different parents and business owners in the area who have not â€‘â€‘| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| some of us have spoken with each other, but others of us were not expecting each other to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| and we'd appreciate it if we could have a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| I think you're asking for more than five minutes of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| I thought you were asking for a postâ€‘comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| More time for comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| I think we can give a few extra minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Is everybody okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| So, as I said, I'm a homeowner in the Westwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| I'm a parent, a Bearden Elementary School student, and I use my bicycle as my primary vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| which is a wonderful thing we can do in the Westwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| So, consequently, I'm concerned about the impact of Kingston Pike traffic on the surrounding streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| and the worsening effect of another driveâ€‘through we'll create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| We do have several driveâ€‘throughs in our community already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| So, on Monday, Taco Bell reached out and presented us with information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| to suggest that a driveâ€‘through would have minimal impact on traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| And they used the idea of a trip generation formula in order to reach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| But, unfortunately, I feel the information that they presented to us was disingenuous and manipulative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| and, quite frankly, to the point of dishonesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| In their presentation, they said that a Taco Bell would generate fewer trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| than a sitâ€‘down restaurant would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| Or they specifically said a highâ€‘volume sitâ€‘down restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| So, an example of a highâ€‘volume sitâ€‘down restaurant would be something like an Applebee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| Well, a typical Applebee's is about 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| And Taco Bell based their trip generation data on the existing square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| of the old Caswalker that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| That is 17,565 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| There's a threeâ€‘story Applebee's in Times Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| It's the largest Applebee's in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| And it is a mere 15,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| So, I feel that basing the traffic or the trips generated data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| on what would be the literal largest Applebee's type restaurant in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| compared to a driveâ€‘through restaurant is disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| In fact, if you do the math, and I used the formulas that they used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| a 500 square foot restaurant or 5,000 square foot restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| would create 48% fewer trips than a Taco Bell driveâ€‘through would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| In an attempt to persuade me that their business would be the safest choice for my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| Taco Bell presented incorrect information based on inappropriate data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| to reach a false conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| And I don't appreciate being manipulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| And I don't appreciate being manipulated when the safety of my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| and my child are what the subject is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3123)|

| 0:52:47| This driveâ€‘through will increase traffic congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| in an already notorious area of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| Creating worse traffic congestion here will directly impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| the adjacent residential neighborhood and two adjacent schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| I walk my children to Bearden Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| and I live in the parental responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| which means by law I either walk or drive my students to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| But very few families walk to school from Westwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| because of traffic safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| There are actually two schools abutting this property, not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| Knoxville Adaptive Education Center is an alternative school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| serving our most fragile students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| Several teachers commented publicly against this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| due to safety concerns due to their population's tendency for elopement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| Taco Bell has tried to justify they will not interfere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| with school arrival and dismissal times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| but Bearden Elementary and KAEC are community hubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| and they house programming long past dismissal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| The YMCA has an aftercare facility at Bearden Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| One Knox Soccer uses the field at KAEC yearâ€‘round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| and West Bearden Basketball League uses KAEC yearâ€‘round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| both the gym for practices and games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| KAEC is also the hub for extended school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| for students with disabilities in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| The Westwood Traffic Committee recently worked with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| to complete a traffic study. I submitted that online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| The traffic study results for my road alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| show an average of 856 vehicles per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| Westwood Road has an average of 1,009 vehicles per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| These high traffic counts are because Westwood neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| is routinely used as a cutâ€‘through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| for drivers avoiding traffic congestion on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| Westwood has been approved for additional traffic calming measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| due to these high car counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| The city warned us, the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| that traffic calming measures are hard to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| due to needing over 50% of agreement from affected residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| It speaks volumes that we had unanimous support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| and approval from every impacted household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| Finally, we have heard several comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| regarding the deterioration of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| This shouldn't be approved on the sole basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| that it will fix the owner's negligent responsibility of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| If he had taken care of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| we wouldn't be dealing with the eyesore that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| and facing demolition of a historic structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| I respectfully ask that you stand your ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| on your own zoning policy regarding driveâ€‘throughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| and not approve this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| At the very least, the commission should require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| a fullâ€‘blown city engineering traffic study be completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| prior to any further discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| The developer said that one was not required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| so they generated their own data for submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Ms. Amy Hathaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3321)|
| 0:55:30| My name is Amy Hathaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| I live at 421 Circle Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| Is there any chance I can have, like, one more minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Again, like, we're not informed of who has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| We've asked for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| We're not told, and so it's impossible for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| to coordinate with who has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| I'm currently serving as president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| of Foresight's Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| and I'm here today speaking on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| of the majority of the association's board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| I attended the meeting Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| and Taco Bell representatives were rather dismissive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| of the traffic and congestion complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| associated with locating the driveâ€‘through at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| Taco Bell representatives don't think the driveâ€‘through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| will make the already bad traffic any worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| Taco Bell representatives also presented numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| to demonstrate the driveâ€‘through would have fewer trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| generated than a sitâ€‘down restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| but those numbers appear to be misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| We oppose the special use application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| for this driveâ€‘through restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| for the following reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| One, the proposed special use is not consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| with the adopted plans and policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| including the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| and the Kingston Pike Commercial Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| The adopted plans encourage mixedâ€‘use, pedestrianâ€‘friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| oriented developments, and by definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| a driveâ€‘through does not support this plan or vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| Two, the proposed special use is not permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| as a right in the CG zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| and therefore is not in harmony with the general purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| and intent of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| Three, the proposed special use will significantly detract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| from the immediate environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| creating additional traffic congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| and safety concerns within a school zone with two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| Four, the proposed special use will injure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| the value of adjacent residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| by noise, lights, fumes, odors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| and especially traffic and congestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| not to mention the lateâ€‘night operating hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| The proposed special use would undoubtedly contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| to additional traffic through residential streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| from both Taco Bell customers and Kingston Pike drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| using these residential streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| as a cutâ€‘through to avoid the congestion on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| For these reasons, we request that you deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| Hi. Keith Britt, 506 Knowlton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| I did sign up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| I realize there's very limited time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| I will only take a minute if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| You guys okay with that? Okay. Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| Keith Britt, 506 Knowlton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| This is just new information that hasn't been presented already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| I am a statistician and a professional researcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Taco Bell driveâ€‘through in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| it's estimated that 90% of their sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| is generated through driveâ€‘through traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| that has since fallen off since the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| to about 70 to 80% in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| A 2022 study by InTouch Insights ranked Taco Bell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| as the third fastest driveâ€‘through in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| behind Chick-filâ€‘A and McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| The 2021 Yum! Brands press release states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| that they see the next decade of commercial investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| to be in their driveâ€‘through operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| They see that as the future emphasis of their brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| This plays out in the specific location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| where they've only planned for about eight sitâ€‘down tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| but they're trying to accommodate 11 cars simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| in the driveâ€‘through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| You work out on the math on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| that's a car entering or exiting this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| every three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| And just a bit of statistical analysis shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| that even if this special use would only increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| the possibility of a car accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| with a pedestrian, a bicyclist, school child, God forbid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3556)|

| 0:59:23| it's better chances than not that something bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Within the first 365 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| it's almost a near certainty at 97.5% chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| of a vehicle collision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| with a pedestrian, bicyclist, or another vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| I drive my kids to preschool through this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| five times a day, well, four times technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| each day, every weekday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| It is just increasingly onerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| to pass through this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| because of the backup on North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| particularly on this westbound side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Any other special use I could get down with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| but anything, a drive-through restaurant, a gas station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| that's just simply introducing way too much danger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| All right, that's all the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| The applicant, would you like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| Before I get started, may I ask for additional time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| so the rest of our team can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Sure, you'll get equal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| Good afternoon, Chairman Hill and Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| I am Sarah McGowan, Project Coordinator at GPD Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3626)|

| 1:00:33| Talkabout Operations Regional Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you for taking the time this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| to hear our request for special use approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| to allow for a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| There is a lot of information that I'd like to share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| so I have to move quickly to provide this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| within our allotted time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I'm happy to answer any questions you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| after the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| We appreciated time to speak and meet with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| since the April hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| We met with the leaders of Westwood HOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Bearden Elementary PTSO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| and the principal of KAEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| as well as reached out to the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| Our team, along with Talkabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| hosted a neighborhood meeting on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| at KAEC Auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| to meet with neighbors to discuss the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| While not all opinions were changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| a number of attendees came up to us after the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| and stated that after seeing our presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| and hearing our answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| they had changed their minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| and no longer opposed the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| However, pedestrian safety and increased traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| along Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| were the two main concerns discussed at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| Currently on site, there is not a designated driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Cars can enter and exit the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| off any point along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Observing car pickup the last few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| some of the cars are parking parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| to Kingston Pike on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| When the dismissal bell rings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| and the car pickup line begins to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| they jut back onto Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| to rejoin the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Their parking inside the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| does not allow for people to safely walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| across the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| We are proposing to narrow the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| to one driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| and install a sidewalk to improve safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I'll discuss the traffic concern later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| The first document that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| that was passed out before the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| shows how the building has changed from 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| when the building was operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| to last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| As the building has become unoccupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| it has passed its usable life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| The existing building is currently built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| on top of the retaining wall that is holding up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| the access drive to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| The retaining wall along the north portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| of the property has failed, resulting in a collapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| All three walls need to be repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| The second document in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| is the proposed renderings for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| I believe that Mr. Reynolds was able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| pass them out to you before today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Our team created four different viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| showing the existing view and the proposed view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| The retaining walls along the west, north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| and east sides will be rebuilt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| and a six-foot opaque fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| will be installed on top of the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| The renderings also show that this property sits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| between 10 to 15 feet below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| the school and neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| The six-foot fence will help block visibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| of the site from the schools and neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| The third document is a colored landscape plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| that shows how the proposed site layout and plantings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| The entire site is currently building our asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| We are proposing to have 37.5% green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| Another document in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| are the ITE trips studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| We have modeled different uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| retail similarly sized to existing building on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| sit-down restaurant sized to existing building on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| and a 2,787 square foot fast food restaurant with drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| While all three of these have similar trip generation numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| it should be noted that fast food with drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| has a 55% passerby rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| That means that 55% of the trips are already on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| The retail building would capture 0% of passerby traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| making it a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| A drive-thru fast food restaurant such as Taco Bell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| would be the least impactful of all three uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| on adding trips to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| A main concern of the neighbors is the increased traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| between school drop-off and pick-up times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| The next document in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| shows the average cell data for the closest Taco Bells,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| five of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| We have marked on the charts the two school drop-off pick-up times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| to show how they correlate with the projected sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| or transactions for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| Taco Bell is not a busy breakfast location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| and only 5% of the sale transactions occur before 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| The peak times for the Taco Bell in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| are from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., making up 23% of the transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| The final document is the photometric plan for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Taco Bell uses fully shielded lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| With the shields and being located below the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| and residential neighbors, the lighting will be contained on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| If you have any questions, after hearing all this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| completely understand, and we're here to answer any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3929)|
| 1:05:38| Hello, my name is Jim Nylinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| I reside at 1900 Wilkinson Crossing, Merida, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| I am the Jim that Sarah introduced as being the project manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| and I would like to speak to the traffic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| So originally we were reading through the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| and a lot of the comments wanted to keep the existing building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| and reuse it for another use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| So we, in our traffic count, used it as a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| as a sit-down restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| and a sit-down restaurant at the square footage of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| is now our accurate traffic counts that are showing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| I know that they used Applebee's as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Applebee's does not approach the seller about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| No small restaurant would be able to put the investment into this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| that needs to be done to fix the issues that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| Now, why would a Taco Bell, if we're not going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| Taco Bell, like they said, is a passerby capture for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| Most people are driving by, and they stop and pull in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| Will there be trips in and out of the driveway? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Will we add significant traffic to the road that's out there? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| There are other drive-thrus out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| and I know everybody keeps talking about Chick-fil-A and Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| My company works with Chick-fil-A and Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| Chick-fil-A has a completely different business model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| and a completely different drive-thru scheme than Taco Bell does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Starbucks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| The Chick-fil-A that's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| I understand why there would be a problem the way it's laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| The way that Taco Bell is being laid out is completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| The drive-thru pickup window wraps all the way around the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| and the entire parking lot would be used for additional stacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| past the 15 cars you see stacked in our actual drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| So the chances that cars would get out onto the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| are basically non-existent in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| whereas the Chick-fil-A drive-thru,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| the canopy is about five to six cars maybe off of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| So when you pull in and somebody's in that canopy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| you're stuck out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| You're not going to come into the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| If the city is interested in any improvements on the Starbucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| I have some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| I designed Starbucks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| But talking about the Taco Bell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| this site will not back up out onto the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| and it will be passerby traffic for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Just to clarify something Sarah said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| it's a.m. and p.m. is the 55% passerby capture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| So that's the peak rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| So when IT looks at the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| they look at the most intense times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| and they figure out that's passerby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| So retail has no passerby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Fast food has passerby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| And sit-down restaurant has passerby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4081)|
| 1:08:15| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| My name is Tony Cappiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| I'm president of People's Development Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| the owner of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| and I'm speaking in favor of this special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| I want to give a brief history of this property since we've owned it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| and talk about why I think that the placing of Taco Bell here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| is one of the least impactful uses that I could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| when redeveloping this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| I live in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| I work in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| My office is in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| And my family has had property in this community since 1945.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| I'll say that I'm a self-proclaimed preservationist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| which means I try to save buildings as best I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| or repurpose them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| I see value in every building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| So, for instance, I partnered with my tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| for a bridge brewing company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| and turned a 1940s garage into a brewery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| which the community has embraced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| I've taken my father's old roller skating rink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| that was pretty dilapidated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| and put anthropology in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| and helped to build the retail community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| I'm now working on redeveloping the Naples property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| I will save buildings if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| This property, though, befuddles me and is a bit of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| Primarily, I had a tenant for the property several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| It would have also required tearing down the old Kaz Walker building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| But in the spring of 2018, we had a 100-year flood event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| and the hydrostatic pressure, the rain that hit the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| pushed the wall down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| The cost of doing that is almost prohibitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| and this is a privately owned property that I would have to finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| and or work with a partner to finance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| Mr. Cappiello, we are out of time unless commission wants to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| Okay. We've got everybody okay with two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| All right. Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| All right. I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| By the way, this property is, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| not every old piece of property is historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| This is an old piece of property as famous as Kaz Walker might have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| Nothing really famous went on there except the selling of groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| So anyway, it's filled with asbestos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| I also have to tear the building down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| It has no functional utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Someone has suggested building a high-rise there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| Can you imagine the traffic that would create a multi-use type building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| If I brought in a specialty restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| let's say I used the other night the example of J. Alexander's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| there would be only one J. Alexander's in the size of the town that Knoxville is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| And if I put it there, people from all over the community would come to J. Alexander's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| What kind of problem would that create in traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| As good and delicious as Taco Bell is, there are 18 of them in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| So no one from Farragut or Fountain City is going to drive to this new Taco Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| It is to serve the community, and so if you happen to be in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| or live in the community, you may go to the Taco Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| I give careful consideration to every property that I own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| and try to bring the best in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| In this case, I think Taco Bell is least impactful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| and the traffic it will create is minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| So we had extended, what, a minute and 20 seconds roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| In spirit of fairness, I'd say we give the opposition a minute and 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| Was it a minute and 20 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| Roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| If you all have anything meaningful that you haven't already shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| we'll provide a minute and 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| In regard to the appropriateness of using an Applebee's as a comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| I would like to direct you to my comment that I left on the Planning Commission website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| where I explained all my math, explained where there's a hyperlink explaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| where I got the data for a high turnover sit-down restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| and what an example of one of those would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| This is obviously not an example that matches the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| and using it to be the contrast for a drive-through restaurant is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4352)|
| 1:12:40| Furthermore, Miller's going to speak about this, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| but the tenor and general whatever of the meeting that happened on money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| has also been misrepresented by the representatives at Taco Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| A few things of note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Mr. Capiello is not a resident of Westwood or Forest Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| I actually hosted the meeting in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| I feel like we should say we co-hosted that meeting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| It was not Taco Bell hosting the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| None of the backup drive-through when we think about Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| Starbucks, I mean not Chick-fil-A or Starbucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| when we think about Kingston Pike or Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| none of those backups then fall into a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| That falls into a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| So I think you want to keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Also the anecdotal data that people came up and thanked them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| We've only had five comments in favor of the property submitted publicly since that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| and we're at over 130 submitted on record against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Let's take it to commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| I thought about this quite a bit, this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| and I've been over there, of course, several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| And my thoughts are this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| One, I don't see how having a Taco Bell drive-through here is detrimental to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| I don't see where traffic is going to come out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| and have anything to do with the neighborhood that's behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| I think the Taco Bell that they proposed looks way better than the building that they have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4455)|
| 1:14:24| I've heard a lot of argument about we shouldn't have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| It's a commercially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| And it previously, if I'm not mistaken, was zoned where this drive-through would be allowed by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4471)|
| 1:14:40| And through the zoning revisions that we went through, it's been changed to a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| So it's not a contrary use to what the property is zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| It's just a special use that requires us to take a look at it, and I think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| My feelings are if we're not going to have a drive-through on Kingston Park, which is a state highway, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| and the state will control the access to the property and off the property, where are you going to have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4503)|
| 1:15:11| Traffic-wise, in my mind, I don't see anybody from anywhere else leaving their house and driving here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4511)|
| 1:15:21| that wouldn't have already been there themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| It's more of an opportunistic stop than it would be a destination, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4523)|
| 1:15:32| So I'm at this point ready to make a motion that we approve it for staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| Okay, we have a motion to approve the special use for staff recommendation by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| We still have more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Let's go to Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| Commissioner Roth, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| I will say that the previous zoning ordinance, which allowed for most of these non-pedestrian uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4559)|
| 1:16:07| during this stretch of Kingston Pike, that zoning ordinance was drafted in the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| That stretch of Kingston Pike has changed tremendously in that amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| The attitudes of the neighbors and neighborhoods and developments around that area have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| You know, we just passed a use on review on consent just further up Kingston Pike, no more than a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4584)|
| 1:16:34| and I think, you know, that area is applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| I think that's a great location for a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| Right now we're looking at a place that is surrounded by two schools, and it's going to be now and in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4600)|
| 1:16:48| an even more pedestrian-related area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| Once we approve this use on review or this special use for a drive-thru, it's not going to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4612)|
| 1:17:00| and we have to think about that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| That's why this is a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| You know, the only comments that have been posted online in favor of the drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| are ones that think that this building is going to look aesthetically better than what's currently there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| and it's a shame that the property owner has been derelict in its duty to take care of this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4635)|
| 1:17:23| even though there's been conditions that have maybe warranted some disrepair of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| You know, if you are a true member of the community, you need to take care of your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| You need to be a good neighbor, and that should not be a reason to grant a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| I am not in favor of the special use for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| I did mention the last time that, you know, with the two schools, pedestrians, kids having to walk to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| a greenway right there, there is no better place for a drive-thru in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4668)|
| 1:17:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| My main concern is that there's only one access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| I feel like if we compare other drive-thrus in the area, whether it's financial or fast food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4686)|
| 1:18:13| there are multiple entry ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| If there is an emergency situation, getting an emergency vehicle in there with the flow of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| I think that's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| There's no way to make a left turn once exiting because if there's a congestion pileup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| no one's going to be able to make a left turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| I'd probably encourage the flow of traffic to go through the school and around to that next stoplight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4711)|
| 1:18:40| I don't know if you can demonstrate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| But going through the car wash and then exiting so that you can make a left turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| I think that would be encouraged in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| It just brings up concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| We're having a light issue over here, so Commissioner Huber is actually turning on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| Ms. Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| I am really glad that Commissioner Midas mentioned the consent passage that happened on a drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4754)|
| 1:19:22| just further down Kingston Pike because when I was looking at those cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4762)|
| 1:19:30| I recognized in my own rationale that the one that was further down Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| that didn't have the same congestion problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| I'm not saying it's peachy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Everyone experiences traffic, but the congestion problems just are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| So I'm glad that you brought that up because I think there's a big difference between these two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| while they are both use-on-review drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| And I think that I concur with your point that the code was changed for a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| that we are being tasked to look at this because not all drive-thrus are the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4805)|
| 1:20:12| because they may be in different contexts to the point of why we passed one on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| and why this one has 145, 147 comments, 130, some of those being to the negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4818)|
| 1:20:29| We have to listen to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| These are parents, business owners, people that are traveling that area all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| and they're raising their hand and saying, this is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| If I had a different experience to contest that, maybe I would say something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| But whenever I go to that area of town, that specific area is a complete bottleneck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| And I think Mr. Calloway or the owner of Calloway's was speaking to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| strategizing as to when they will go to that area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| I'm one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| So I wanted to concur with those points that Commissioner Midas said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| I also wanted to point out that the developer commented on two other properties that had been created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4872)|
| 1:21:24| abridged and anthropology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| If there was abridged two or anthropology two going into this location, I would have no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| I do not believe that those properties would generate the kind of additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| or additional problematic traffic that this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| The drawings are very crisp, very clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| They show a location that would certainly look better than the building that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| But the fact that a previous property owner has been derelict is not what we are really dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4911)|
| 1:21:59| What we're dealing with is this an appropriate location for a drive-through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| Not if drive-throughs are bad or good, but is this a particular location correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| And I cannot support this for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| I also just want to make one pull-out comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| And this came from Ben Bar-Saunders from the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| This was sometime in the last couple of days saying that as neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| we support projects that will improve our Bearden neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| We do not believe another Taco Bell will do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| I think that's just straight to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| And I will not be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Yeah, I know this is a tough one, especially, you know, we've gotten so many comments on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| And I can understand there's always, you know, a lot of unknown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| especially with respect to commercial real estate and how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| But I do, I am familiar with commercial real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| And it really, this type of use really does, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| generally service the existing traffic, not, you know, as we were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| you know, coming in from other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| You know, it will have peak times and it will have slower times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| But generally it's going to service the traffic that's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| that's already backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| One thing I want to note is, you know, from city engineering and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| and the civil engineer that worked on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| I do like the way they've designed it from a stacking perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| And I don't think it's going to be stacking out onto Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| I think, you know, it may get back into the parking lot a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| But I've seen some designs, you know, that will roll out into the road a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| I really don't think this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| Also, how they've got the drive-through and the service boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| where they'll be talking back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| located on the west side of the building versus on the back side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| So there's not noise from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| from the box going back into the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| So I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| You know, one thing, you know, Commissioner Minish brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| I know it's not always about the aesthetics of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| But one of the things I do recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| is we've got a completely impervious area there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| It's 100% impervious with the roof lines as well as 100% parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| This plan shows about 40% becomes pervious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| between landscaping and grass and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| that will greatly help us with filtering stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| and going a long way towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| I like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| And I'm sure that's through the codes and through staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| and everybody looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| But I appreciate them doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| And the last thing, there's been some talk about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| almost a conflict between the drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| and walkability or pedestrian traffic, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| You know, and the turning movements in and out of those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| are very slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| You know, I mean, when you pull in, you're in line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| you inch up, you inch up, and then you eventually pull out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| I just don't see necessarily a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| between pedestrian traffic and a drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| because everything tends to move so slow at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| So with all those, I mean, it's a tough decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| but I'll be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| Commissioner Schell, so I've been on the fence on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| and I'm partial towards a Taco Bell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| because I've worked a few buildings down from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| and I do very much like Taco Bell, but not letting that influence me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| I've been on the fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| and hearing some of my commissioners here, Commissioner Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| your comment especially about looking on the map right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| at facilities that do have drive-throughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| most all do have some other additional way to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| either it's split up one entrance and one out onto Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| or, you know, like the Chick-fil-A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| you can go back onto that other road or the Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| and I think that that's pretty important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| and a lot of the other drive-throughs, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| I know I'm not really supposed to look specifically at the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| but banks' drive-throughs are ancillary to their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| It's not necessarily their primary driver of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| You can walk into the bank and do the exact same transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| So additionally, you know, this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| we looked at a change that we recommended to a city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| that I don't think they've acted on yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| They had a workshop on recently with the change to the CG2, CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| Build 2 zone line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| and we drew that line at Bearden Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| which is a little further west of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| That discussion was that we want to continue to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| the Bearden Village area develop in a pedestrian-oriented way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| with buildings closer to Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| and I don't see how this helps that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| So I think I'm now against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| after hearing many of my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| All right. Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| You know, we keep talking about, you know, our Bearden neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| and, you know, the current condition it's in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| which we do have to remember that Cappiello Real Estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| is a big reason why the Bearden neighborhood is the way it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| They have done a fabulous job going in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| and redoing these buildings and repurposing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| You know, if a representative from Cappiello shows up and says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| they don't think it's financially feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| to make this building into something other than the proposed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| I mean, I believe him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| I think the one question I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| is to maybe just some of the Taco Bell representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| You know, we've always been told by our parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| that nothing happens good after midnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| and as I understand, this is going to be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| until 4 a.m. in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| Are there any kind of increased crime concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5298)|
| 1:28:38| Hello. My name is Heather Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| and I'm the operator of the Corporate Taco Bells in Georgia and Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| And this restaurant right now is currently planned to be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m., so it would not be until 4 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| And the crime rate does not increase because the time you're open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| it's really we have a lot of policies and procedures that we have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| to make sure we're keeping a safe environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| for our employees and our guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| And it's really around our execution of those policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| that impacts the safety and reduces the crime rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| So we don't see, and especially in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| if you look, you can look at the other Taco Bells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| We have not had a burglary issue or robbery issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| or anything of that nature in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| Thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| Yeah, and again, I just want to go back to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| that we just said to another community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| we don't care what you want, we're doing what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| That directly affected the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| They were asking because of high crime rates and homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| And here, I mean, again, I live in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| and this is where in our community it becomes East Knoxville gets dumped on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| West Knoxville gets what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| I don't think that's the case fully, but that's the perception out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| So I think we need to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| The second thing regarding this property, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| as Mr. Capello said, it is asbestos laden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| During a hundred-year flood caused the wall to collapse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| which honestly is partially unsafe for the neighborhood behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| right this minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| But I also want to remind everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| because if you did not grow up in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| and I'm going to get in a lot of trouble for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| and probably some hate mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| but Kaz Walker had a lot of racist innuendos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| in all of his commercials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| Tearing down this building and getting rid of one more vestige| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| of that racist past and letting something else come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| that will be a support to this community in a positive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| is something that I, quite frankly, I'd love to see it just shelved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| I'd like us to rid our past of things that have harmed the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| You know, again, no traffic, as Commissioner Roth said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| is going to be going directly into this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| It's staying on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| You know, I addressed the second drive-thru issue a while back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| because I was concerned with the second exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| because that is the main entrance into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| I feel like that's too much congestion going into that little side street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| up by the car wash and Taco Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| So that's why I'm supporting and giving the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| But again, these are just some things that we need to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Let's not pit neighborhoods against neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| because we're listening to one side of town and not the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| And let's just get rid of a problem, an eyesore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| that really is sitting there with asbestos right next to our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Let's get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Primarily I want to comment that I think that that's a gross mischaracterization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| of the previous case and how that conversation was handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| I don't â€“ the attitude was not about â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| and I think I can speak for everyone in saying that it was not anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| trying to say that we don't care what the neighbors think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| And I think â€“ or even the part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| where we're specifically talking about walkability and access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| And I think that that's still the same conversation here that's been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| is walkability and access and safety for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| So I think that this conversation, regardless of who is on which side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5531)|
| 1:32:18| is very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| So I don't really appreciate that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| But I also do kind of â€“ I agree with a lot of the fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| about some of the comments about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| And I do think that a drive-through here in this part of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5554)|
| 1:32:40| is not really in the spirit of where Bearden â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| the direction that Bearden is trying to go from everything that I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| over the past few years where it seems like Bearden is trying to be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| pedestrian-focused and pedestrian-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| And not to say that people can't walk into a drive-through or take a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| Sidewalks on this part of Kingston Pike are pretty rough as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| And then also to the comment of the other drive-through facility that we approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| they had a deceleration lane on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| And so there's a little bit more room for cars pulling off and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| So I do think that this is a very specific scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| And I agree with the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| I don't think that a drive-through here is really in character with what's around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| I was actually going to comment on â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| I've always been a big proponent of the citizen input in our cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| But I don't think it's incumbent upon us to pick and choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| who we're going to listen to and who we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| And I think this case â€“ again, I go back to the zoning that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| I go back to what this property is now and what it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| And I would argue that walkability, if you look at the renderings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| after this Taco Bell is built, it will be easier to walk across one lane of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| than people getting on and off Kingston Pike and parking in the parking spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| that are lined up along Kingston Pike with no barrier to entry or exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| And the other thing I'd like to do is hear from traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| We've talked about traffic now for about 45 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| and we hadn't heard from them about their opinion about how this thing gets laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| and who makes the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| I'd like to hear from them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| Curtis, I guess the question is, do you have a specific question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| We've talked about traffic and what the impact is and which way you're going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| and who makes the decisions on how that happens and is it already made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| or is the state still reviewing this and they get to determine how it works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5704)|
| 1:35:11| Your mic's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| Maybe this one will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| I can't speak on what the state currently is saying about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| but I can say that we've had a chance to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| and did a little bit of research at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| Just to the east of here, there's a TDOT count station that's been counted for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5732)|
| 1:35:39| It goes back to maybe 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| Surprisingly, the traffic in this corridor has been on the decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| 2004 was when it saw the highest amount of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| roughly a little over maybe 22,000 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| Right now, the last, I'll say, useful data is from 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| We have some data from 2020 and 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| but that's obviously not necessarily accurate due to folks staying at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5768)|
| 1:36:15| The 2019 data showed that there's about 19,000 trips per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5775)|
| 1:36:22| in this general area on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| If you look at that and you do look at the amount of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| that would be generated by the Taco Bell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| the Taco Bell would roughly generate about 1,000 trips per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| but it's been mentioned that there's a pass-by reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| That's a real thing that traffic engineers look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| Locally, we use a 40% reduction, not the 55 that was mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| You're talking about reducing the trips by about 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| Really, it's only generating about 600 trips per day, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5818)|
| 1:37:05| That works out to about 3% of the current traffic on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| It's very, very minimal when you look at it as the overall corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| It's also much less than the corridor has historically had on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| If you add 600 trips back in, you're still less than 20,000 trips per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| which is nowhere near what the annual average was several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| Yeah, Director Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| I do want to point out that the congestion that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| of that section of Kingston Pike is primarily due to the intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| there at Kingston Pike and Bearden Place and Kingston Pike and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| TDOT has about a $20 million investment program for that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| those two intersections, adding additional capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| and signal improvements and laneage at North Shore and Kingston Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| They have preliminary designs already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| It's been studied for the last 15-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| I would anticipate that within the next three to five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| that that intersection will be improved, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| going from the North Shore-Kingston Pike intersection up towards Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| with additional lanes and turning movements at North Shore-Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| That is the primary reason you have the backups all the way up through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| to west past Bearden Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| It's the Kingston Pike-North Shore intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5913)|
| 1:38:41| Okay. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| I appreciate what Curtis shared and Mr. Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| because I do think what you're saying is accurate in the experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| There are problems upstream or downstream that are causing the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| that are in front of that particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| But I think that that doesn't mean we should add on to that problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5939)|
| 1:39:05| or do something that is going to mitigate the alleviation measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| that are being put in place by what you just described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| the new things that are coming with those investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| I don't think that we should be looking at this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| to add into the problems that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| I think looking at how we continue those improvements with each choice that we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| as this body is where we should put our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5969)|
| 1:39:36| Mr. Reynolds, would you like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| I know this was your case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| and this is an opportunity for you to share any comments or sentiments from the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5981)|
| 1:39:48| I'm not sure if I have too much to add from the staff report itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| I would say that this was a tough one for me to review and give a recommendation on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| I would have much rather just kind of kicked it down the road to you all to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| and make a decision one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6000)|
| 1:40:08| I think what weighed on me was the implementation of the Bearden Village Plan to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6008)|
| 1:40:15| and recommendations for zoning and the pedestrian improvements in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| in particular along Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| and I guess a program for incremental or comprehensive improvements to pedestrian infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6023)|
| 1:40:40| I think Kingston Pike itself is not going to be the pedestrian-oriented front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6040)|
| 1:40:47| Obviously it does make connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| It is a major east-west connector for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| You can't really get to North Shore without going on Kingston Pike very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| So it does play a crucial role in that pedestrian network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| The zoning part of it was the other issue that I kind of ran into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| The Bearden Village Plan talks about creating zoning that allows a mix of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| which the CG1 zone does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| It talks about requiring parking to the rear or hopefully to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| The CG1 zone does not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| The Bearden Village Plan talks about requiring villas to be built up to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| The CG1 zone does not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| If it was CG2 or CG3, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| So I guess I saw there were parts that were still trying to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| We didn't quite have all the pieces in place yet to say that this is going to turn into what the village plan wants to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6106)|
| 1:41:56| I think the areas that are side streets and Homburg Place are better suited for pedestrian-oriented development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| where pedestrians feel comfortable walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| Kingston Pike is going to be a major component of that pedestrian system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6126)|
| 1:42:14| So long-term, it does need to gear itself towards the pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| I'm not sure if this facility will hamper that one way or the other in the grand scheme of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| but that's how I felt on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| Because there was seemingly so much interest in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| one, I want to just share really for the public benefit how we're supposed to review special uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6158)|
| 1:42:48| I'd like to call on Attorney Blakeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| Some of us might like Taco Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| Some of us may not like Taco Bell or some other use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| We don't have really the latitude to choose in that manner, and so we do have six very defined criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6180)|
| 1:43:09| and you're going to see probably a variety of votes regardless of the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| but I think it's important to understand that we're basically bound to six criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| and I'll let Attorney Blakeney describe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| So because this is, of course, a special use review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| you're looking at Section 16.2 of the Zoning Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6208)|
| 1:43:35| which tells us that the listing of a special use within a zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| doesn't mean that there's an assurance or a presumption that the special use is to be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| but each special use has to be evaluated on an individual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| and you have to rely, as the Chairman just noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| that there are a number of specific criteria that are supposed to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| The first is whether the use is consistent with adopted plans and policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| including the general plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| The second standard for consideration is whether the use is in harmony with the general purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| and intent of this particular zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| The third is whether the use is compatible with the character of the neighborhood where it is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6253)|
| 1:44:20| and with the size and location of buildings in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| Next, you consider whether the use will not significantly injure the value of adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6264)|
| 1:44:30| or by noise, lights, fumes, odors, vibration, traffic, congestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6270)|
| 1:44:36| or other impacts detract from the immediate environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| Next, the use is not of a nature or so located as to draw substantial additional traffic through residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6280)|
| 1:44:48| And finally, the nature of development and the surrounding area is not such as to pose a potential hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6288)|
| 1:44:55| to the proposed use or to create an undesirable environment for the proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| Okay, any questions? Any other? I see no other lights, no other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| So we have a motion to approve the special use and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Let's call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| Commissioner Ooten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| I'm sorry, Commissioner Ooten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| Yeah, I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| I thought I was loud enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| Really, I read the staff recommendation, but I didn't really hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| And I think Mr. Reynolds, the way he walked through all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| helped me read the staff recommendation, so I'm going to go with staff on this one and say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6342)|
| 1:45:50| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| As Commissioner Ooten, I'm a little bit torn on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| When I look at the zoning district, which is a CG one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| and I look at how it's set up, it's really not in line with what the original plan for Bearden was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| I'm going to vote yes on this, but I also ask staff to look at coming back to us at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| with a new set of standards, zoning standards for that corridor, that section of corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| to get it more in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| Right now, under the current zoning, there are no minimum lot widths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| no minimum lot sizes, and so most developers will take the easiest route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| and cut the property up, small slots as they can get and sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| That means more access cuts, more conflicts with vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| so I think we've got to really change our code in that particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| But yes, my vote is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| Thank you. Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| Commissioner Shelton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| Commissioner Perez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| Commissioner Levenson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| You know, a lot of us at this table here are feeling mixed feelings on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6437)|
| 1:47:28| I'm the president of Bearden Village Council, and Commissioner Midas is vice president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| We have a lot of dear friends out in the audience here that participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| Just looking at staff recommendation, looking at the conditions in Bearden with the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6460)|
| 1:47:51| the traffic, the T-dot, major arterial, I'd probably win a popularity contest if I voted no on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6471)|
| 1:48:02| but this seems to be, looking at the criteria, I just don't feel like I can vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6482)|
| 1:48:10| I think it's appropriate to say yes to this, and so I'm going to vote in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6490)|
| 1:48:17| It's a tough decision, and maybe city council can finish the job if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6497)|
| 1:48:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| There's eight yes and five no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| Let's take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=6526)|

| 1:59:42| hey, let's reconvene, oh, wow, have you got a slip sheet for that, oh, you did, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7182)|
| 2:00:00| what was it, okay, okay, we're going to start with item number 17, this is it right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7200)|
| 2:00:16| yeah, 17, okay, hey, before we get started, I just want to mention Director Welch, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7216)|
| 2:00:25| is his last meeting as the Executive Director of Planning, although it's his fourth, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7225)|
| 2:00:35| think, fourth go with this, isn't that right, fourth, I'm a slow learner, yeah, so he sat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7235)|
| 2:00:44| in this seat over 38 years, four times as Executive Director and I tell you it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7244)|
| 2:00:53| a pleasure to work with him, we're going to miss him, he's not going to retire just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| yet, but he's going to go back and oversee the TPO and hopefully hire his replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7257)|
| 2:01:05| in the near future and then after 38 years of service, he will be retiring when, Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7265)|
| 2:01:13| Welch? End of August. End of August, okay, so anyway, he's much appreciated, I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7273)|
| 2:01:20| to give him a hand, you'll be sorely missed. Mr. Chairman, before you go, can we postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7280)|
| 2:01:32| his retirement until Kingston Pike and North Shore is fixed? That's a good idea, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7292)|
| 2:01:41| item number 17, this is the proposed amendments to Article 11.1.B, required parking for renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7301)|
| 2:01:52| of existing buildings and change of use in Article 11.1.C, expansion or improvement of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| existing parking lots, let's see, who handled this case? This would be Peter Ahrens from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7318)|
| 2:02:06| City Codes. All right, Director Ahrens, would you like to speak on this matter? I'm happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| to speak on this matter, I'm Peter Ahrens, the Director of Plans Review and Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| Inspections. I'll give you a little bit of history, back in 2017, the city updated the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7335)|
| 2:02:22| parking requirements and during that time, we worked with Scenic Knoxville, the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7342)|
| 2:02:31| was Kmart parking lots that were vast, and we implemented a 50% rule, which, big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7351)|
| 2:02:41| if somebody invests 50% of the value of the property, it triggers bringing the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| lot into compliance. Five, six years into this program, we're seeing a lack of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7367)|
| 2:02:54| in certain areas of town because their property values are significantly lower, and so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7374)|
| 2:03:01| personally have seen a lot of projects die on the vine because of this. We went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7381)|
| 2:03:09| to Scenic Knoxville, worked personally with Joyce Feld, she wasn't able to be here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| she said she was willing to, but she had a previous engagement. The goal here with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7393)|
| 2:03:20| rules, or proposed changes, would be to allow existing parking that is legal and safe to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7400)|
| 2:03:29| remain. If you increase parking, you can build along the existing lines, whereas with a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7409)|
| 2:03:40| parking lot, you might have a 10-foot setback for a buffer yard. If you add at a 10-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7420)|
| 2:03:48| where the existing is only 5-foot, you create some level of dysfunction. So the rules indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7428)|
| 2:03:56| that you can continue to build along those lines, but you will have to landscape that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| and whether or not you have the 10-foot, as long as you've got at least 3-foot setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7441)|
| 2:04:06| you'll be landscaping it, and that's where we talked with Casey Krause to make sure there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| was adequate soil volume to support landscape. But overall, big picture, recognizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7451)|
| 2:04:21| we do have existing parking lots that are safe, recognizing that the current rules really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7461)|
| 2:04:32| are impeding development in some of the lower-priced areas of town, and we think this is a viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7472)|
| 2:04:43| solution. Happy to answer any questions. Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7483)|
| 2:04:53| So I took 18 off of consent also, because it's in conjunction with 17, and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| Commissioner Higgins for taking this off consent. You know, I know that two years plus went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7499)|
| 2:05:07| into creating this parking ordinance. Is that right? I think so, yeah. And I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7507)|
| 2:05:14| the process being very arduous. There was a lot of input from the community. The stakeholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7514)|
| 2:05:19| group that was on it included a variety of individuals, not just Joycefeld and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7519)|
| 2:05:25| from Scenic Knoxville, but contractors as well that came up with this. And I guess my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7525)|
| 2:05:32| concern with the 50 percent rule is that if you eliminate that, the only chance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7532)|
| 2:05:39| we have for improvements to be made to a parking lot would be if they completely raise the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| building. Is that correct? Yes, ma'am. So someone could leave one side of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7545)|
| 2:05:54| up and not have to make improvements to that parking lot. Is that right? Sure. So, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7554)|
| 2:06:04| know, I guess as a community member, when this parking ordinance passed, I was excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| because what it did is it gave maximums to the amount of parking so that you couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| have these huge parking lots, and it allowed for green space not only in the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| but in perimeters to basically beautify our community. And while I do feel for some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7580)|
| 2:06:27| these lower income properties that may be our burden, you know, by just eliminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7587)|
| 2:06:33| that 50 percent, you're eliminating any opportunity you have for other properties to be improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7593)|
| 2:06:39| and for green space to be added to our city. Is there a process that some of these lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| income property owners could go through to get a variance on that parking or to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7606)|
| 2:06:52| around it if they did want to develop it but it was too much of a financial burden? I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| going to say no because the variances are based on a hardship. Is that not a hardship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| The financial end, no. I guess I would, I don't think I'm going to be able to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7623)|
| 2:07:10| this, and I guess I would like to send it back to you, the planning staff, to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7630)|
| 2:07:17| some other option because I feel like if we pass this now, enforcement of this parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7637)|
| 2:07:23| ordinance is, there's not going to be, there's going to be reasons and too many loopholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7643)|
| 2:07:29| for anyone to be able to actually enforce these changes that the community wanted. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7649)|
| 2:07:36| you. Thank you. Mr. Higgins. Can I respond real quick? Sure. As the director, if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7656)|
| 2:07:45| tore down three of the four walls, I would say it was raised. The reason I said they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| could do that is because I don't know who will be here after me. Loopholes will always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| be available, but understanding the spirit and the intent, if somebody's, I call people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7674)|
| 2:08:01| on the, to the court all the time, trying to loop through inappropriately, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7681)|
| 2:08:08| always going to be some level of judgment, but that's it. Well, so as the one that pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7688)|
| 2:08:21| this off consent, I, I'll clarify first. I completely agree with this. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7701)|
| 2:08:28| this is a good move. I see it playing out where that, where this criteria does call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7708)|
| 2:08:37| cause undue burden. The reason I pulled it off was to get a clarification and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7717)|
| 2:08:47| have asked this on Tuesday, but we ran out of time. But with item number five, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| added to it, required parking will be recalculated with a change of use or new addition. My question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7733)|
| 2:09:01| is if there was a situation where you have an existing building and maybe it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| require, you know, it would not have met that 50% threshold, but they add on an addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7747)|
| 2:09:13| or maybe do a change of use that's not, you know, a complete overhaul and not as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7753)|
| 2:09:24| of a lower budget, would that then trigger having to build additional parking spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7764)|
| 2:09:31| Yeah. If there is an addition and it doesn't hit the 50%, yeah, you have to comply with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7771)|
| 2:09:38| parking counts. And that's one where under the current rules, we do see several, I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| seen several people come in for variances because their existing parking lot is five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| feet off the property line. And in order to meet the current, that addition would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| to be set back further and it makes the parking lot unfunctional. So they're going to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7795)|
| 2:10:01| getting variances for those reasons. But to answer your question, this is a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7801)|
| 2:10:08| right now that anytime you have an addition or a change of use, we recalculate. We thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| that putting it in the code would provide some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7813)|
| 2:10:18| I think that's a good point. And so in that scenario, as it stands, it doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7818)|
| 2:10:28| how much money you spend, if you do an addition or change of use, you're recalculating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| number of parking spaces. And like I said, I've seen this play out many of times. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7834)|
| 2:10:41| so I think that this is a really good move. So I would actually go ahead and make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| motion to approve this as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| We have a motion by Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner Huber to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| for staff recommendation. Let's see here. Commissioner Smith. Oh, Commissioner Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7856)|
| 2:11:05| slash Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| Thank you. I did have a clarification on that too. So when you're not redoing the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7867)|
| 2:11:14| lot, how does that intertwine with the storm water regulations? I mean, is it when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| saying the 50% rule and you're getting into the parking lots in the storm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| There's three different 50% rules that are extremely confusing to all of our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7883)|
| 2:11:31| That's one of the side benefits of getting it out of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| And we don't need to get into all that. But I do applaud you guys for certainly re-evaluating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7894)|
| 2:11:41| this, because I think it's important for us to invest money in a lot of areas of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| And it gives the developers an opportunity to do that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| Thank you. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| And going back to Commissioner Midas for a second, you know, can you help me understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7914)|
| 2:12:00| this a little bit? Can you give me some finite examples in the most recent past where if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| this had been enacted, that things might have happened or would we have ended up with any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| of the scenarios, you know, as described, where it could have been a partial demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| with things still left? Are there, like, what precipitated this? You know, give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7935)|
| 2:12:21| some examples of why this, I'm just trying to help understand this one just a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7941)|
| 2:12:25| bit better. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7945)|
| 2:12:32| If you've got an office on Magnolia and a florist wants to go in there, it's change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7952)|
| 2:12:42| of use. Any redevelopment of that vacant space is essentially going to hit that 50% threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| So that means they have to tear up asphalt. They have to redesign. And they walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7969)|
| 2:12:57| I would say the best example that I have of getting rid of the sea of asphalt would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| West Town Mall when I think it was Tesla went in on the southwest corner. We got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7982)|
| 2:13:12| couple of landscape islands with the current regulations that those are the two examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7992)|
| 2:13:19| that I can give you. So just to add as another Commissioner Smith, it's quite plausible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=7999)|
| 2:13:27| have, let's say, two identical buildings, one in, let's just say Bearden, that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| be worth $3 million and one on Magnolia that could be worth $300,000. And really same square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8013)|
| 2:13:40| footage. I mean, that's a very plausible scenario where the one on Magnolia would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8020)|
| 2:13:47| limited to $150,000 before it has to, once it exceeds that, then they've got to fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8027)|
| 2:13:54| comply and the one in Bearden could go up to $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8034)|
| 2:14:02| But now the one in Bearden wouldn't have to do anything if this is passed, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8042)|
| 2:14:09| If it stayed under the, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| So now they don't have to make any improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| That's right. But I just wanted to give the differentiation of values by sector. But you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| We're eliminating a lot of properties that financially are not under a burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| Could improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8065)|
| 2:14:26| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8066)|
| 2:14:27| They're not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| And that's my question. So now we're treating, you know, the $300,000 property the same as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| the $3 million property. There's no 50% cap with this proposal, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8072)|
| 2:14:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| That's correct. I think one of the gains that we got out of this is additional landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| perimeter landscaping. It's not, you don't hit that threshold when you've got your six-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8084)|
| 2:14:51| It's, you're going to put it in. If you expand your parking lot to beyond 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8091)|
| 2:14:59| and you don't have a full six-foot buffer yard, you still have to add landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8099)|
| 2:15:06| That was one of the tradeoffs that were gained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| I think Mr. Berry, did you want to add something, Mr. Berry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| I was just going to speak to, I'm Brian Berry with City Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| To a recent example, I'm sure most of you are familiar with Wallace Baptist Church off of Merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8118)|
| 2:15:24| So they did some reinvestment in the existing property, particularly the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8124)|
| 2:15:31| with changing some configuration around in addition to adding some features to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8131)|
| 2:15:38| Based on the code and the requirement, the amount of improvements required them to bring the parking setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8138)|
| 2:15:48| and location into compliant with current code because the nature of where it was located on a residential road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8148)|
| 2:15:58| while it had been existing at the current setback of nine feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| they were going to be required to comply with 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| So they weren't adding new parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| They were basically just kind of reconfiguring and redesigning some things and improving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| And so they had to go and apply for a variance to do that in order to keep the established setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| that was already there for the parking lot when all they were doing was just kind of improving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8180)|
| 2:16:26| Could you share with us what the hardship was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8186)|
| 2:16:35| The hardship that they provided was existing parking lot became noncompliant due to recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8195)|
| 2:16:45| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| I would just also add that in that scenario of the two different properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| one hitting its threshold at $150,000, the other hitting its threshold at $1.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8212)|
| 2:16:58| both of those properties would be striving to minimize costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| And they're both going to try to avoid doing as much extra work as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8223)|
| 2:17:11| And the one that has the range of $1.5 million has a lot more range to avoid that, having to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8231)|
| 2:17:19| So I don't think that this would lead to adverse effects for properties that would have been over the 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8239)|
| 2:17:28| I think that the 50% actually motivates people to spend less than 50% of the value of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8248)|
| 2:17:38| So I still have that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| Seeing no other lines, we have a motion and a second, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| Go ahead, Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| In most cases, isn't the requirement for parking less under the new parking ordinance than before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8271)|
| 2:18:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| So it's not like they're needing to add additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| Their requirements are usually less than they don't have to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8286)|
| 2:18:13| If it's the same use, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| But if you change the use, if you go from a business office to a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| that parking count is going to increase because it's a more intense use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| Or if you put an addition on, your parking counts are going to increase because you've got a greater square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8303)|
| 2:18:28| In most uses, the parking is based on the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8308)|
| 2:18:35| So Mr. Berry was saying that the hardship that that church used was that it was a non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8315)|
| 2:18:43| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| They were specifically reconfiguring their parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| And the way the current code is set up, if you reconfigure, it has to comply with current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8328)|
| 2:18:55| And so they had an existing footprint that they were trying to reorganize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8335)|
| 2:19:03| And the way it's written now, you can't just reorganize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| You have to shrink it because you've got to get those setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8346)|
| 2:19:11| And so they just said that â€“ what was their reason for a hardship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| Their reason for the hardship was its existing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| But can't someone say that any time for a hardship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8359)|
| 2:19:26| They can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| Did they get the variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| Were they approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| In that case, let's clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| In that case, would it not have killed their drive aisle with the setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| So it would have made the whole property non-functional because of the setback requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8380)|
| 2:19:47| Is that accurately spoken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| Once you have to shrink your parking lot now, parking lots, they're not built â€“ Mr. Williams can attest to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8389)|
| 2:19:57| They don't build parking lots with extra space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| They usually make them as small as possible so you've got your parking space and your drive aisles and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8400)|
| 2:20:06| And so if when reconfiguring you have to shrink it, now you've just lost either a row of parking spaces or â€“ I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8406)|
| 2:20:19| There's a lot of variables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| But essentially folks now â€“ I guess to your point of people gaming the system, they're doing that now already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8420)|
| 2:20:31| I guess I just worry there's going to be a lot more gaming the system because you're not limiting them to any type of percent improvement to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8431)|
| 2:20:43| I don't think that we're going to â€“ I think we're going to see more investment because people won't have to pay money to game the system to get what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8443)|
| 2:20:53| Right now, if somebody wants to keep their existing parking lot, they'd have to go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8453)|
| 2:21:02| So they have to wait two months, spend money, and roll the dice versus just being able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8462)|
| 2:21:15| It's a shame that so much work â€“ I just feel like the teeth of this ordinance is just being lost by passing this rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8475)|
| 2:21:22| And that's why I just have a hard time supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| I would ask where you've seen it successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8485)|
| 2:21:31| If we remove it, it's not going to be successful unless a property is raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8491)|
| 2:21:41| I want for our city â€“ I want more green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| I don't want to see parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8504)|
| 2:21:45| And I got the impression that back in 2017 when this passed that that's what people wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8505)|
| 2:21:54| It doesn't come down to â€“ I mean, I guess what you're saying comes down to dollar signs, whether they're going to add trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8514)|
| 2:21:59| And they're probably â€“ they work around the system because they don't â€“ it's the bottom line for a developer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8519)|
| 2:22:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8526)|
| 2:22:07| It's just â€“ I mean, I'm not a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8527)|
| 2:22:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8531)|
| 2:22:12| I'd like to see the trees and the landscaping and improve the aesthetics of our streets and our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8532)|
| 2:22:22| So I'd like to add a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| When we think about parking lots, particularly with landscaping, the things that apply in the landscape ordinance are parking lot perimeter landscape yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8545)|
| 2:22:33| and that's something that still is looked at and applied to based on some of the recommendations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8553)|
| 2:22:41| There is site landscape, which deals with a new building or an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8561)|
| 2:22:48| So an existing building does not have to require site landscaping unless it's an addition that's 30% or more in square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8568)|
| 2:22:57| There's interior parking lot landscaping, which only applies to parking lots that are 20,000 square feet or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| And one of the things that we applied or recommended in the new amendment is with a change of use or new addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8584)|
| 2:23:12| when existing parking exceeds the maximum number of spaces permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| one landscaped parking lot island must be provided between every 10 parking spaces in accordance with this interior parking lot landscape requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8596)|
| 2:23:26| So we're basically saying if you're over-parked, then you need to provide interior islands to accommodate this landscaping until you meet the maximum number by reducing the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8606)|
| 2:23:40| I don't think it's that the landscaping won't be applied or is not applicable. I think it's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8620)|
| 2:23:50| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| Just looking at it, trying to look at it from a different angle, and this may be completely impossible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8633)|
| 2:24:00| but if what Commissioner Midas is concerned about is that now with the changes, there would be no real incentive for people to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8640)|
| 2:24:12| But to your point, there has been not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| It's really disincentivized people from investing in certain parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| And that's the reason for the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| Then is there a way to modify it so that instead of it being perceived as punitive that, oh, I can't go into this particular property or this particular area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8663)|
| 2:24:33| Is there a way to incentivize for those who do go ahead and make changes based upon some percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8673)|
| 2:24:42| Again, maybe that's nuts, but just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| There are incentives, there's facade grants, there's stuff that's outside of my department, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8688)|
| 2:25:02| I'll say that I agree with you, Miss Madison, the dream of people tearing up asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8702)|
| 2:25:10| For the past six years, that's all it's been is a dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8710)|
| 2:25:15| These proposals, they don't remove the requirement for landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8715)|
| 2:25:22| They actually increase the requirements of landscaping in certain areas that I think you're concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8722)|
| 2:25:34| I forgot where I was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| Is there more that I needed to answer for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| About incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| I think you just said not your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| So would there be a way to set a threshold where, say, a building permit worth more than X number of dollars still triggers a 50% rule so that we could keep, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8748)|
| 2:26:02| Is it legal to set a threshold on a permit to trigger that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8762)|
| 2:26:09| Because, you know, the privilege of very high property values and continuing to improve those areas, that could stay in place while we incentivize redevelopment of lower cost areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8769)|
| 2:26:23| I am not aware of a better mousetrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8783)|
| 2:26:27| I'm happy to discuss, collaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8787)|
| 2:26:37| These proposals are based on real world examples for the past six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8797)|
| 2:26:42| And overall, I agree that something needs to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8802)|
| 2:26:48| The sort of situation or a lack of equity in different parts of town and being able to feasibly do projects I think is important for us to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8808)|
| 2:26:58| So, you know, ultimately city council has to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| So maybe some tweaks can be made from here to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8822)|
| 2:27:09| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| Sorry to keep jumping in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| I want to clarify part of the one of the things that when I read this, what made me really excited about this change is in my experience working in the areas that are that they're referring to that are disadvantaged here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8833)|
| 2:27:33| I think that so modern parking standards are more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8853)|
| 2:27:40| Larger aisles, larger spaces, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| And I think if anything, this will actually help us to have more green space and less asphalt in a lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8864)|
| 2:27:57| And again, with the landscape requirements still being there, I think that we are still requiring a good amount of added landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8877)|
| 2:28:06| But what I'm seeing here is, you know, if you were improving a building, not changing the use or doing an addition and your parking lot was a few spaces shy of the requirements and you had some green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8886)|
| 2:28:23| If with the 50 percent rule, if you're going over that 50 percent, you now have to go in and dig up that green space and put parking spaces there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8903)|
| 2:28:33| And so with this change in that scenario, you could actually leave that green space there and enroll with the slightly fewer parking spaces than are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8913)|
| 2:28:46| So, yeah, I see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| I see the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| But I also see this as allowing for much better uses of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8931)|
| 2:28:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| Seeing no other lights, we have a recommendation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8946)|

| 2:29:15| Motion passes 12-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8955)|
| 2:29:23| Moving on to item 18, which is also the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8963)|
| 2:29:30| We have the applicant still present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| Staff recommends approval of amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| The city code appendix B zoning code article 12.5 parking lot perimeter landscape yard that provides language that is consistent with the proposed changes to off street parking article 11.1.B and updates the landscape reference to section 11.1.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=8977)|
| 2:30:00| And article 12.6 interior parking lot landscape yard that provides language that is consistent with the proposed changes to off street parking article 11.1.B and removes a reference that is no longer found in the removal of section 11.1.C from article 11 off street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9000)|
| 2:30:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| Director Herring, what say you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9025)|
| 2:30:29| This makes the landscaping portion align with the proposals that you just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9029)|
| 2:30:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| We have a motion to approve for the recommendation by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9040)|

| 2:33:48| If the opposition would come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| If you'd state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| Cassie Kiesler, and I live on Hazelnut Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9235)|
| 2:33:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| So I guess our biggest issue kind of with this whole thing is that that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| he owns a piece of property across the street, Caddywumpus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| It's 6800 Oak Ridge Highway, which is currently still zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9249)|
| 2:34:15| He's owned that property for a while now, and he's been using it as a commercial business space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| and parking large concrete trucks and equipment on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9260)|
| 2:34:26| If you pull up the Google map view right now, you'll see that he has those vehicles parked all over that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9266)|
| 2:34:33| and it's supposed to be a single-family dwelling, not a commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9273)|
| 2:34:39| When he put the permit in for this property that he's building on now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| he put in a permit request for a single-family dwelling with a detached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9282)|
| 2:34:49| When that was not at all his intention from the jump, that property sits on a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9289)|
| 2:34:56| Only a small percentage of that property is not on the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| I live down the stream from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| He's built up that property to allow for a huge parking area for these trucks that are not supposed to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| even zoned as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| He could have trucks there, according to his lawyer, part of the time, but only while he's working on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| which past actions indicate that that will not be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9316)|
| 2:35:20| and the size of the parking lot that he has created at this piece of property indicates that that will not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9320)|
| 2:35:27| He's poured a concrete pad for a large dumpster trash can, which backs up to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9327)|
| 2:35:33| It is in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| It's just going to create a myriad of issues for those of us that are farther down the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9336)|
| 2:35:41| It already has because trash from his building site is hung on our fence right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9341)|
| 2:35:47| I just feel like he's going about this wrong because he's put in for one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9347)|
| 2:35:54| and he's built the property, the house is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| and now he's trying to shoehorn his way into changing it because, well, it's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9357)|
| 2:36:04| Yes, it may fit with the sector plan, but I don't truly believe, based on his pastâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9364)|
| 2:36:11| I mean, you can see it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| Those are heavy, huge trucks parked all over that residential piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9373)|
| 2:36:18| Past actions don't indicate that he's going to follow the rules this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9378)|
| 2:36:23| and I think that he shouldn't get his way just because it fits into the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9383)|
| 2:36:29| because he's going to do what he wants, and it's still not going to fit in with whatever you guys approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9389)|
| 2:36:35| So do you want to talk, Alvin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9398)|
| 2:36:43| If you're allowed to go forward with this, my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| are you going to allow him to run a construction site there for his construction company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| because that's what he's going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| Are you going to make him put in handicapped parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| Are you going to make him put in a handicapped restroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| Are you going to make the house accessible to the handicapped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| If you're going to make it commercial and it's going to be office medical, then that's what it ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9422)|
| 2:37:09| It shouldn't beâ€”he's built a large building in the back to work on his trucks and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9429)|
| 2:37:14| so then he's running a garage, even though the garage is to work on his own equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9434)|
| 2:37:19| So now we have to put up with the noise and the dust from this equipment and stuff like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| that we had to put up with across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| The property that I'm talking about that we own is adjacent to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9446)|
| 2:37:30| It's right next door to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| I'd be out front mowing the yard there where my mother-in-law lived there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9452)|
| 2:37:36| and they would pull in across the road, and it's just a gravel lot, and dust would go everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9456)|
| 2:37:41| It's not a good situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9461)|
| 2:37:45| What are you going to stop the buffers on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| Am I allowed to put my property up as commercial property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9468)|
| 2:37:52| Is the next one going to be allowed to do that, or are we going to move it on into the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| So sometimes it's got to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| He did apply for residential to go in there, and so that's what we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9478)|
| 2:38:04| But you can see that his plans wereâ€”he's not upholding what he originally went after, and that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9484)|
| 2:38:15| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9495)|
| 2:38:24| Come on up briefly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| Real quick, I want to add, too, that the parking of those commercial vehicles on that floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9507)|
| 2:38:34| and in an area that is going to potentially leak whatever stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9514)|
| 2:38:38| and if he's working on these vehicles in that area, into the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| which is going to contaminate the water in that area because it's going to flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9522)|
| 2:38:48| It's going to. I mean, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9528)|
| 2:38:51| And a lot of the homes on down from him are on well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| so you're looking at potentially contaminating our wells as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9534)|
| 2:38:59| And if he's going to be working on vehicles there, then that could potentially happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9539)|
| 2:39:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9547)|
| 2:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9551)|
| 2:39:12| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| We're all having light problems today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9556)|
| 2:39:19| I'm not making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9559)|
| 2:39:20| I'm just asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9560)|
| 2:39:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9561)|
| 2:39:22| What's your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| Well, my comment here was that we're looking at zoning here, not specific uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9563)|
| 2:39:28| and I don't necessarily have a problem with this transitional zoning away from the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| I just had a question for codes and Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9573)|
| 2:39:38| It sounds like there's some issues going on out that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| and I would just like for him to comment on what these uses that these folks are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9580)|
| 2:39:49| I would think that that would not be appropriate in the OB zone, whether we do this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9589)|
| 2:39:55| So I just wanted to have you comment to these people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9595)|
| 2:40:00| It is not an appropriate use in the OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| The address across the street, we've actually given a notice of violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| and I think we're moving towards a citation to court if they don't get the equipment out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9608)|
| 2:40:14| What the owner has told us, he wishes to rezone this property to OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9614)|
| 2:40:19| to have just his office space, I guess to run the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9619)|
| 2:40:24| But in the OB zone, there's no storage of equipment outdoors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9624)|
| 2:40:27| so he couldn't have the concrete trucks and the equipment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| He could only have an office for his business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| So there would be a complaint-driven issue where they would complain to you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| you guys would go out and take a look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230511?start=9644)|
