| 2:37:04| Overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9424)|
| 2:37:06| I'm sure you've already got the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9426)|
| 2:37:11| You want me to look it up while everybody's waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| Let me ask you another one while you're looking that up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9434)|
| 2:37:16| On our bonded indebtedness, are we only paying interest on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| Yeah, I'm glad you asked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| I'm glad I did too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9442)|
| 2:37:24| Let me talk a little bit about that because it brings up an important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9444)|
| 2:37:28| Last year, when the county commission approved the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| the county commission approved the pension bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9451)|
| 2:37:34| There were two different bond issues, two different bond markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9454)|
| 2:37:38| The pension bonds had to be issued in the taxable market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| and the capital plan had to be issued in the tax-exempt market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9462)|
| 2:37:50| Taxable is generally, almost in every case, higher interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9470)|
| 2:37:55| In tax-exempt, because people don't have to pay income taxes on the interest earned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| in almost every case it's going to be a lower interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| So what we wanted to do is pay off the higher taxable bond principal amounts first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9483)|
| 2:38:11| That's why Commissioner Leuthold asked why did we shorten up our pension bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| That's exactly why, is that we wanted to get the taxable on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| and get the most expensive out of the way the earliest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| and have those outstanding for the fewest amount of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9501)|
| 2:38:24| Bond year dollars is what they call it as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| and then have the cheapest money out there the longest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| And you really have to look at both bond issues together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| And those two issues, we issued it in two different markets, but they really fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9514)|
| 2:38:39| And so if you look at one, you say, well, that's interest only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| Well, there's a reason behind that, and it was thought of beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| I also see here we're dipping into our fund balance $8 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9527)|
| 2:38:54| For?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9534)|
| 2:38:58| For non-recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| For non-recurring expenses, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9541)|
| 2:39:04| You know, if you look at where we are, there's no question about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9544)|
| 2:39:08| that in this budget, in last year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9548)|
| 2:39:12| last year's budget using $7 million out of the general fund fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9552)|
| 2:39:16| that took a strain on the county's finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| And I feel like it's a big success to be able to present you with a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9560)|
| 2:39:25| that has no use of general fund fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| There are some other funds, and we can go through them item by item if you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| that still use some fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| I've been through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| I think it's still well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| The general debt is the biggest piece, $6.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| It's down from last year's $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| And also in accordance with our capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| So this is in accordance with what was planned for in last year's capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| that was approved by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| And we've cut the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| Commissioner Moore earlier talked about our debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| I don't know if we can issue $40 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| It was approved last year by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| It's $46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| So that has been cut by $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9607)|
| 2:40:10| And then if you look at capital plan to capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| the county's proposed capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| last year's five-year capital plan projected a borrowing of $194 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9616)|
| 2:40:22| This year's five-year capital plan is only $74 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| And that's a cut of $120 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| And so I think what you've seen is that we've really pulled back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| And I think it's been in a responsible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| Basically, what we're doing with our fund balance is like charging everything on a credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| When it comes due in a month, we're just paying the interest on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9643)|
| 2:40:47| It's basically what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| Now, you mentioned a while ago to Commissioner DeFries that we have two properties that you have bites on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9648)|
| 2:40:55| I'm sure that the old commissioners here know that that's more than likely the AJ building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| and the State Street property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| Would this be in an attempt, if we sell this property, to try to take care of this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9665)|
| 2:41:12| Where would that money go if we sell this property is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| And that would be up to the county commission, the proceeds of any kind of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| And if you wanted to make that choice and say we'd like to reduce our indebtedness, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9682)|
| 2:41:27| If you wanted to say I wanted to put that back into fund balance, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9687)|
| 2:41:32| Or if you wanted to have some kind of mixed use, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9692)|
| 2:41:37| I like the idea to be able to put back money in the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| I like the idea of reducing our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| I also like the idea of getting as many properties as we can on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9702)|
| 2:41:47| So I'm good all three ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9707)|
| 2:41:54| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| Yes, I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| I think that what I'm looking at here is what the adopted budget was last year on what we projected that the county property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9718)|
| 2:42:05| or not projected, it was the adopted budget for the county property taxes and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9725)|
| 2:42:10| and the local options tax and the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9730)|
| 2:42:13| And have you projected out where at the end of the fiscal year we will be on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9733)|
| 2:42:17| And I heard you say earlier that we're ahead on the county property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9737)|
| 2:42:23| And I was wondering where we stand on the local options tax and the wheels tax from what was adopted last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9743)|
| 2:42:28| to what we actually are going to, what actually is predicted that we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9748)|
| 2:42:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9752)|
| 2:42:33| I'm glad you asked, and thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| You should have, I hope everybody's got one of these booklets, supplemental information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| There's been some people who have been concerned about revenue projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| and I'm glad that you shared your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| We tried to give you some additional information to help you understand our projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9767)|
| 2:42:52| and our thought process better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| And I think just if you go to the first page, you talk about property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9774)|
| 2:42:59| According to your budget, we projected at $788,000, depending on the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9779)|
| 2:43:04| And at the time that it was made, people thought that was a good projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9784)|
| 2:43:12| And in accordance with the assessor, with the trustee, and our own economic forecast, we turned out better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| We're already now at $794,000 per penny on the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9798)|
| 2:43:23| That's already $6,000 ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9803)|
| 2:43:27| Some people want to look at, okay, what's the difference between our new year budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| our proposal is $814,000 per penny on the tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| and the difference from $788,000 to $814,000 is a little above 3%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| and people get a little nervous about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| But we had significant conversations with the assessor, with the trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9821)|
| 2:43:45| and just knowing that we're already ahead of budget, $814,000 is something that we're going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9825)|
| 2:43:53| And I feel very, very comfortable about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| So I'm glad you asked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| How does that in actual dollars, how does that come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| Because what I'm looking at right here, just to help me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| it's the adopted fiscal year 2008 budget on the county property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9843)|
| 2:44:08| Do you know what in dollar amounts those turn out to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9848)|
| 2:44:14| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| I don't have those right in front of me, but I think the budget was right at $212 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9855)|
| 2:44:19| I think we're going to collect $214.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9859)|
| 2:44:23| We'll be up a couple of million better than that, and at a $218 budget for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9863)|
| 2:44:32| So you think we're going to end the year up how much additional on the property tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9872)|
| 2:44:37| At least a couple million dollars, probably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| Three or four million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| Yeah, I think three million is a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| That's what you're projecting for the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| And what about the local options tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| Are we ahead or behind on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9888)|
| 2:44:51| We've got different pieces for that, and I think that's a good discussion to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9891)|
| 2:44:56| You look at school construction fund, the current year budget is $18.7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9896)|
| 2:45:02| where we got actual collections last year of almost $19.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9902)|
| 2:45:07| So there's a half a million dollars less than our last year's actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9907)|
| 2:45:12| We're going to beat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9912)|
| 2:45:13| We're going to beat that probably $19.3 million is my number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9913)|
| 2:45:17| and our next year's budget is $19.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| Very, very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9920)|
| 2:45:25| Engineering public works, I think we're going to be right on the money for $4 million, $4.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9925)|
| 2:45:30| And then your new year budget is about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9930)|
| 2:45:35| General fund is coming in a little bit short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| but I think we're going to be fine in other revenues to make up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9937)|
| 2:45:41| Our budget only went up from $5.9 million to $6 million for general fund sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9941)|
| 2:45:46| Schools, let's talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9946)|
| 2:45:49| Last year's actual was $10.59, $10.58, $10.99, $10.79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9949)|
| 2:45:55| And our budget for this year was only $10.59, $10.59, $10.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| And so we projected almost no increase for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9959)|
| 2:46:03| And so what we're doing is we're taking this year's increase plus next year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| and putting it in exactly where we think it's going to be at $10.86.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9967)|
| 2:46:12| So I think if you take our sales tax together, we projected a budget of $134.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9972)|
| 2:46:21| I think we're going to be above $135 on our collections, and our budget is $138.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9981)|
| 2:46:26| I think that's all within reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9986)|
| 2:46:32| And finally, on the will tax, how do you project we're going to end the year on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9992)|
| 2:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9998)|
| 2:46:39| Will tax is a little bit more of a story on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| because there's a couple different pieces that make that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| But our number is about $800,000 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| There's about $260,000 that are exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| Now that the county clerk has already started asking people for verification on the exemptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| those numbers have dropped dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| And I think very, very conservatively cut those in half, and that's $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10021)|
| 2:47:07| Seventeen people is another $500,000 in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10027)|
| 2:47:14| And we know that the trustee's office is five people down, and we know we can get that with excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10034)|
| 2:47:23| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| Do we have the actual sales tax number for the first quarter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10047)|
| 2:47:34| We don't have them down here, but we can get those for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10054)|
| 2:47:38| And just know, and for people who don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10058)|
| 2:47:40| I think it's good to know that the county's fiscal year is a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| than the county's sales tax year, and so the county's fiscal year starts July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10064)|
| 2:47:49| But what we count is we count July collections and August collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| And so if you were to look halfway through the year, there would be two months short of what you would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| And so I just want everybody to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| You look at the first quarter, well, two out of the three months are really counted toward the previous fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10080)|
| 2:48:06| just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10086)|
| 2:48:08| We want to look at 12 and 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| But do you remember what the numbers are for January, February, March, first quarter of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10090)|
| 2:48:17| You may be looking at them yourself, but I don't have them in front of me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10097)|
| 2:48:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| Getting back to something that Commissioner Lutho brought up was the sheriff's pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10102)|
| 2:48:30| The sheriff's employees put in $39.4 million, not $30 million, almost $10 million more than you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10110)|
| 2:48:38| We put in $57 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| That's $97 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| Now, last year we budgeted $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| So on the $97 million, who's getting the interest off that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10128)|
| 2:48:53| Yeah, I'm glad you asked that because, once again, that was a $131 million promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10133)|
| 2:48:58| And with the $39 million, I'm glad you've got the number in front of you, $39 million contribution from the sheriff's deputies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10138)|
| 2:49:05| $57 million in bond issue, come back to $96.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10145)|
| 2:49:11| That's all been deposited with the Knox County Retirement Board and all the interest earnings, all the investment earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10151)|
| 2:49:19| And, of course, it's carefully watched by investment advisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| and that's part of what Kim Bennett's group does is help to manage those investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10162)|
| 2:49:26| and help to make those best investment choices to make those monies grow as well as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10166)|
| 2:49:34| because I know that you are on the pension board and that you help oversee those investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10174)|
| 2:49:38| and that you do know that those are included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10178)|
| 2:49:41| and that $96 million grows as part of underneath the pension board's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10181)|
| 2:49:47| But when was it transferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| So it's on deposit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10189)|
| 2:49:50| We closed the bond issue in November, and I think that we wired the money the same day that we received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10190)|
| 2:49:58| I know as fast as we could do it, the money, the bond proceeds were wired to us, and we wired it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10198)|
| 2:50:05| Of course, we had to coordinate with the retirement office, the trustee's office, and our underwriters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10205)|
| 2:50:11| and we did that as fast as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| The benefits of the interest and all the investment earnings are in the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| and the cost, all the interest costs are on the county side, and you'll see that in the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10218)|
| 2:50:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10225)|
| 2:50:26| But when you talk about we're contributing 10.5% of their salary to the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10226)|
| 2:50:33| we've been doing 6% for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| So, I mean, to say we're doing 10.5%, let's make it clear to the people in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10236)|
| 2:50:41| that we had already been paying 6% anyway for all county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10241)|
| 2:50:46| So it's an additional 4.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10248)|
| 2:50:49| So people don't think it's 10% of their pay going on top of it because 6% was already going anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10249)|
| 2:50:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10255)|
| 2:50:56| And if I didn't make that clear, Commissioner Moore, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| But, like I said, we were contributing 6% with their 6%, and it's the additional on top of the 6% would be the additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10258)|
| 2:51:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10267)|
| 2:51:08| Commissioner Moore, I believe that that's went up to 8% if you've been here over seven years, hadn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10268)|
| 2:51:12| Over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| Over five years it's gone to 8% instead of 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10276)|
| 2:51:17| So, you know, it could be 2% depending on how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| I'm just saying the cost versus before we changed the plan form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10279)|
| 2:51:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10284)|
| 2:51:26| So last year we budgeted $7 million on our side to pay off the $57 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10286)|
| 2:51:32| So what was the actual payment for the $57 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10292)|
| 2:51:39| Last year at this time when the budget was proposed, the county didn't know how many of the officers would sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10299)|
| 2:51:46| They didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10306)|
| 2:51:47| We didn't have the benefit of an actuarial study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| We had preliminary numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| We had some preliminary ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10311)|
| 2:51:53| And last year we didn't know how many of the officers there were, what their salaries were, what their experience were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10313)|
| 2:52:02| And now that the actuary has had the benefit of a full year into the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10322)|
| 2:52:07| that they were able to go through and do what an actuary does and make the calculation, make the projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10327)|
| 2:52:13| And, you know, you go back a year ago, we were just projecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10333)|
| 2:52:18| Okay, John, just stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10338)|
| 2:52:19| I don't care about all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| What actually did we pay out of $7 million last year to cover the $57 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10341)|
| 2:52:33| If you look at the items in the budget, you've got two items in the budget from last year that look unusual, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10353)|
| 2:52:41| And there was a $7 million item as an attempt to be able to let everybody know there's an amount out there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10361)|
| 2:52:49| We know all that, but what actually did we pay down on the $57 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10369)|
| 2:52:54| What does it cost us to have the $57 million bond for 12 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10374)|
| 2:52:59| Yeah, the cash out is like $3.85 million in the first year's payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10379)|
| 2:53:04| I mean, it's all been published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| Well, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| So we've got $3.85 million that we paid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| So what happened to the difference of the $3.85 million and the $7 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10389)|
| 2:53:16| The $7 million was an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10396)|
| 2:53:18| Did we approve $7 million or did we approve an estimate of $7 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10398)|
| 2:53:22| So we only really approved $3.85 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| So the $7 million included, and there's a couple of different places for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10405)|
| 2:53:32| because I think what you're doing is just bringing back one confusing item from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| No, I'm trying to make it really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| We've got a $57 million payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10419)|
| 2:53:44| I just want to know how much that cost us for 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10424)|
| 2:53:47| I mean, it's just a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| For 12 months, $57 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10429)|
| 2:53:51| Just from memory, because I don't have the amortization schedule in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10431)|
| 2:53:55| it was $3.85 million, and then on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10435)|
| 2:53:58| then you have to put what the county contributes as a match on the payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10438)|
| 2:54:05| No, we were already doing that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10445)|
| 2:54:06| That shouldn't be part of the $7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| because we were doing that prior to the pension plan changing for the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10448)|
| 2:54:13| But the county in the current year is matching at 9%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10453)|
| 2:54:17| and for the proposed year they're proposing to match at 10.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10457)|
| 2:54:22| Well, just as we talked about, it starts at 6%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10462)|
| 2:54:25| and it can go up for any county employee with so many years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10465)|
| 2:54:29| And it was at 6% for many, many years, and it's at 9% here since January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10469)|
| 2:54:36| 10.5% effective July 1 if this commission approves the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10476)|
| 2:54:40| But $7 million shouldn't have been part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| And this is in accordance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10483)|
| 2:54:45| And something I do want to say is that what we're proposing in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10485)|
| 2:54:49| would fully fund according to what the actuary recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| And so the amount of money that should be there will be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10492)|
| 2:54:55| and we're not shortchanging it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| If you read about pensions across the country, many, many of them are in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10497)|
| 2:55:03| And what our contribution would be is just what the actuary recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10503)|
| 2:55:08| And he says we're in pretty good shape, very good shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| I think what Bob Cross told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10510)|
| 2:55:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| So I feel comfortable with the county's contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| Well, if you would, provide me with what happened to the $7 million in actual dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10517)|
| 2:55:25| not saying that we gave 6% of it, went to pay the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10525)|
| 2:55:31| because I don't think that's actually the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10531)|
| 2:55:34| Because what we've got is we've got two different pieces of the cost of the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10534)|
| 2:55:37| We've got the piece that's the debt service piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10537)|
| 2:55:40| and we've got the piece that's the payroll match piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| and they need to be put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| And I think we need to talk about actual dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10544)|
| 2:55:47| So I agree, and we'll be glad to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10547)|
| 2:55:51| Commissioner Davis, Commissioner Pinkston, I think it is seven years instead of the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10551)|
| 2:55:57| No, Commissioner Davis, I was correcting myself to you that I think it is seven years on the 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10557)|
| 2:56:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10563)|
| 2:56:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10564)|
| 2:56:05| Commissioner VanDeVate, can I ask you again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| You had just expressed to Mr. Pinkston that $20,000 was going to be going into the mayor's paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10567)|
| 2:56:15| Is that the expense allowance or is that the employee travel, $20,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10575)|
| 2:56:20| Which $20,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10580)|
| 2:56:25| I believe it's characterized as expense allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10585)|
| 2:56:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10589)|
| 2:56:30| And our travel budget, and this may make this a little bit confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| but our travel budget for the office, I believe, is also $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10594)|
| 2:56:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10600)|
| 2:56:41| So $93.70, where it says employee travel, that is the travel allowance for the whole office, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10601)|
| 2:56:49| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10611)|
| 2:56:52| And then $91.95, which is the miscellaneous expense, which is the mayor's expense account, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10612)|
| 2:57:00| Which is also $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| I don't agree with putting that directly into his paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| I think that that needs to be, I don't have a problem with him having an expense account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10627)|
| 2:57:12| but I think that he needs to turn in receipts for that and be reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10632)|
| 2:57:16| I think that we need to know exactly what those dollars are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10636)|
| 2:57:21| I don't think that, I think that everyone here in Knox County is looking to see that we're making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10641)|
| 2:57:29| that we're being a watchdog for their dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10649)|
| 2:57:32| And I think it's important that everybody is concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10652)|
| 2:57:36| and I just don't think that that promotes open and transparent government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10656)|
| 2:57:44| which is what everybody is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| So I would appreciate it if that was just a budgeted amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| and then if the mayor needs to use that $20,000 for expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| he can do so, but just turn in receipts for reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10674)|
| 2:58:03| Commissioner Browntree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10683)|
| 2:58:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10688)|
| 2:58:09| John Troyer, this question is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| In the booklet that we received at the mayor's budget presentation at Hardin Valley Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10691)|
| 2:58:18| last page, page 31, appropriations from fund balance for 08, $19.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10698)|
| 2:58:28| How much of that $19.6 million will we need to use in fiscal year 08?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10708)|
| 2:58:36| It's going to be less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| I think that if you take the general fund overall, we're going to beat revenue estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10718)|
| 2:58:42| and I think we're going to turn in unspent budget, unspent appropriations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10722)|
| 2:58:48| and so the number is going to be less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10728)|
| 2:58:51| You look at the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| I think they pretty much are using all of their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| and so they'll use most everything that's there of the plan million three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10735)|
| 2:59:00| Solid waste is going to turn back some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| I think the revenues, of course, are just transfers, so it's mostly right on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10742)|
| 2:59:06| but they will turn back some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| Air quality uses their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10748)|
| 2:59:13| And then debt service, we're coming in better than what we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| One, our interest expense is less than what we had planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| and I think we're going to beat budget on revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10758)|
| 2:59:21| So, yeah, we're not going to use as much as what was planned in the $19.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10761)|
| 2:59:25| but we want to use as little as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10765)|
| 2:59:29| because I think what you're going to end up seeing is that this year is not as bad as what we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10769)|
| 2:59:34| and I'm glad to report that next year the proposal is to use significantly less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10774)|
| 2:59:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10784)|
| 2:59:45| I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10785)|
| 2:59:51| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10791)|
| 2:59:54| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10794)|
| 2:59:55| I was wanting to request of John Troyer, I would like for you to do a print-up for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10795)|
| 3:00:04| how you all are proposing to spend the hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10804)|
| 3:00:09| because I see here that it might generate $5,760,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| Our projection is $5.5 million, and our proposal is to use $260,000 of the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10815)|
| 3:00:25| Okay, so 45% of that would go to the Greater Knoxville Sports and Tourism Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10825)|
| 3:00:32| $200,000 for the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10832)|
| 3:00:35| There's another $150,000 for Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| There's $505,000 for East Tennessee Historical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10839)|
| 3:00:45| and $2 million for the city's share of the hotel-motel as well as the city's convention center payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10845)|
| 3:00:53| You're amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10853)|
| 3:00:55| Listen, can you get that written down for me, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| Yeah, I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10858)|
| 3:00:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10859)|
| 3:01:01| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| Yes, I want to say something to Ms. Davis there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10863)|
| 3:01:08| Ms. Davis, you're absolutely correct, and I think all of these non-accountable funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| every one of them should be accountable, even the commission's discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10872)|
| 3:01:16| We should come up with a resolution, anything over $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10876)|
| 3:01:20| you have to come down here and get permission from all the commissioners for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10880)|
| 3:01:26| This is for Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10886)|
| 3:01:32| I believe you're speaking for the Office of Neighborhood, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10896)|
| 3:01:37| Allison, what are you all doing different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| What are you doing different up there, going to be doing next year that you're not doing this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10899)|
| 3:01:46| We have taken on some codes from Public Works and Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10906)|
| 3:01:52| We have three employees that have been transferred from that department to ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10912)|
| 3:01:58| Well, I'm a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| That's like the Department of Community Development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| In less than two years here, your budget is more than doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10924)|
| 3:02:10| You know, that's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10930)|
| 3:02:11| It seems like everything up in the mayor's office, we're giving more money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| and we're cutting everybody else on these things that we really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10935)|
| 3:02:18| And what does the Office of Neighborhoods do that other departments didn't take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10938)|
| 3:02:24| before this department was put into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10944)|
| 3:02:31| We do neighborhood nights for the mayor, which is the equivalent of Mayor's Night Out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| We do them in all parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10956)|
| 3:02:39| We do a neighborhood conference that hasn't been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10959)|
| 3:02:43| That's something that we started when we came into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10963)|
| 3:02:46| We have a 215 helpline for people to call and we get them answers to their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10966)|
| 3:02:51| That wasn't done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| Grant works with sustainable communities and healthy communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10973)|
| 3:02:59| We're working on getting grant funding for Water Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10979)|
| 3:03:06| I'm sure there's more, but off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| Those grants don't come in under the Department of Community Development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10988)|
| 3:03:13| Any department can locate or apply for a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=10993)|
| 3:03:20| I mean, it's sort of like Doug Battelle's office is applying for a grant for a pocket park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11000)|
| 3:03:27| and will apply for a grant to help with the Regional Water Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11007)|
| 3:03:33| or will apply for a grant for any number of projects that we may be working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11013)|
| 3:03:41| Well, I'm concerned about it as far as this 215 help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11021)|
| 3:03:45| I'm sure all the older commissioners here know people are still calling me wanting help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11025)|
| 3:03:52| We did it before and I don't understand why you all have taken it over and they still call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11032)|
| 3:03:59| Because you're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| Anyway, I'm just concerned about a budget more than doubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11043)|
| 3:04:06| And then another thing that concerns me here is you only requested $218,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11046)|
| 3:04:11| and they're funding you proposing $387,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11051)|
| 3:04:16| What's that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| I wish it was for a raise for me, but unfortunately it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11058)|
| 3:04:21| It reflects the three new employees that we brought into our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11061)|
| 3:04:26| Well, are you cutting the highway department out of that, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11066)|
| 3:04:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11070)|
| 3:04:32| They were general fund employees, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| John, let me ask you something on this restructuring of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| Don't you think that we should restructure it before you come up here and put all this into the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11078)|
| 3:04:42| What if we don't approve these things, this restructuring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11082)|
| 3:04:47| I think you'll have an opportunity through the budget to speak to it, to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11087)|
| 3:04:53| And I know that Mr. Vandervate has indicated that he plans to bring an organizational chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11093)|
| 3:04:59| for the county commission to consider here in July or August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11099)|
| 3:05:04| So you'll have more than one time to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11104)|
| 3:05:06| Well, it's been restructured before and we've never gotten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11106)|
| 3:05:08| We're supposed to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11108)|
| 3:05:09| It looks to me like we should have had that several months ago before we vote for this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11109)|
| 3:05:19| I think you've got a good budget proposal in front of you and we stand by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11119)|
| 3:05:24| What if we don't approve of this restructuring and we approve the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11124)|
| 3:05:30| You know, we can bring our friendly law director back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11130)|
| 3:05:33| and see if that counts toward fulfillment of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11133)|
| 3:05:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11138)|
| 3:05:39| That would be a good question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11146)|
| 3:05:50| First question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11150)|
| 3:05:51| I'll get to you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11151)|
| 3:05:52| But the first question goes to John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11152)|
| 3:05:55| Going back to the $20,000 miscellaneous expense for the county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| and I'm trying to figure this out in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11160)|
| 3:06:03| why would he put it in and count it as salary and pay taxes when he could have it somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11163)|
| 3:06:10| say in a community grants or somewhere and not pay taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11170)|
| 3:06:14| It looks like he would lose probably a third of it to taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11174)|
| 3:06:20| I don't advise the mayor on his tax bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| You're the finance director for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11183)|
| 3:06:25| so if we're giving $20,000 and we're losing some just that we could be giving out to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11185)|
| 3:06:30| and we're losing it just to the IRS, I mean, is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11190)|
| 3:06:35| Is that what you would suggest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11195)|
| 3:06:39| That's something to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| That is an alternative, and I will certainly bring that up with the mayor to talk about an accountable plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11201)|
| 3:06:48| whether it's in community services, whether it's in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11208)|
| 3:06:52| That's an option that the mayor has chosen against in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11212)|
| 3:06:56| and I don't want to speak for the mayor on his own personal taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11216)|
| 3:06:59| He has his own personal CPA who does his taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11219)|
| 3:07:02| Well, we're talking about taxpayer money, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| and if we're losing $2,000 or $3,000 or $4,000 of taxpayer money just to pay to the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11224)|
| 3:07:11| why would he want to have $16,000 to spend instead of $20,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11231)|
| 3:07:16| Well, the mayor has indicated to this body before that he does value the small bit of privacy that he does have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11236)|
| 3:07:23| and I would take that suggestion to him, and he may consider your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11243)|
| 3:07:28| Well, if he keeps it in like that, would you come forward and say the commissioners may ought to keep their $6,000 in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11248)|
| 3:07:34| and we can give it out privately and just write personal checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11254)|
| 3:07:37| and that way we can be quicker with it instead of going through the finance department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11257)|
| 3:07:41| Would that be fine with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11261)|
| 3:07:44| I think that's a decision for this body to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11264)|
| 3:07:49| But you're okay with it if we wanted to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11269)|
| 3:07:51| How the commission chooses to do that, I think that would be a decision that this commission needs to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11271)|
| 3:07:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11277)|
| 3:07:58| Allison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11278)|
| 3:08:02| Just starting off at $45,000, $10,000 in the budget, you've got full-time to pay $143,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11282)|
| 3:08:13| Who does that cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11293)|
| 3:08:16| Myself, Grant Rosenberg, Crystal Rader, and then the CODES employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11296)|
| 3:08:28| So $143,000 covers you and Grant and somebody else and three CODES officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11308)|
| 3:08:34| I think we're getting a cheap deal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| I'm sorry, it's just the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| And who's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11319)|
| 3:08:40| Myself, Grant, and Crystal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11320)|
| 3:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11326)|
| 3:08:47| Other salaries, $127,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11327)|
| 3:08:54| That's the CODES people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11334)|
| 3:09:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11340)|
| 3:09:01| And then you go on down to other professionals, $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11341)|
| 3:09:12| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11352)|
| 3:09:14| That is the contract we have with Pratt & Rice that's actually been cut to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11354)|
| 3:09:23| Well, some of these things keep changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| When are we going to be notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| I mean, this is the budget that's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| So if we'd approved it, there would have been $10,000 more floating around for somebody to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11369)|
| 3:09:36| Good thing we're having the hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11376)|
| 3:09:48| And going on down to other related services, $4,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11388)|
| 3:10:15| Do you see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11415)|
| 3:10:26| It says $4,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11426)|
| 3:10:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11428)|
| 3:10:29| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11429)|
| 3:10:32| I believe that's our printing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11432)|
| 3:10:38| I don't have a breakout of that specific code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11438)|
| 3:10:48| I think that includes printing and postage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11448)|
| 3:10:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| Now, with taking on more responsibilities from these code officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11453)|
| 3:10:59| did anybody who supervises these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11459)|
| 3:11:02| are they receiving any type of additional pay from what they had last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11462)|
| 3:11:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11468)|
| 3:11:09| The step increase if they're eligible for the step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11469)|
| 3:11:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11477)|
| 3:11:18| And can you send us the list of employees here and what their salaries are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11478)|
| 3:11:24| and what they were last year and what they'll be this year after the budget's approved, if it's this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11484)|
| 3:11:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11489)|
| 3:11:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11490)|
| 3:11:32| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11492)|
| 3:11:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11495)|
| 3:11:36| Ms. Fogerson, what is the mayor's present salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11496)|
| 3:11:39| I know that you said that next year's budget would go to $148,000 and something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11499)|
| 3:11:43| and I know it's by statute, but could you tell us what the salary is this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11503)|
| 3:11:49| without the expenses, just the base salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11511)|
| 3:11:52| I have to make a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11512)|
| 3:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11513)|
| 3:11:54| If you wouldn't mind doing that and just letting us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11514)|
| 3:11:56| Allison, how many calls have you gotten on this 215 helpline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11516)|
| 3:12:01| or Grant or whomever might know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11521)|
| 3:12:05| Over the past year or the past month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11525)|
| 3:12:11| If you've got a yearly figure, that's great, or a monthly figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| I'm trying to get an idea of the activity that comes in on that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| As far as phone calls, we get about 8,000 a year, 35 or so, 40 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11538)|
| 3:12:25| I anticipate that number to grow, having all the codes calls come directly to 215 help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11545)|
| 3:12:32| Do you get e-mails as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11552)|
| 3:12:34| E-mails, and then we get separate phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11554)|
| 3:12:38| I'll get personal phone calls and phone calls that go to the county mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11558)|
| 3:12:43| and other departments as well that just get referred to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11563)|
| 3:12:47| So with constituent complaints, with everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| how many would you say that office would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11569)|
| 3:12:53| and what is your projection for next year with the codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11573)|
| 3:13:00| That's number of phone calls, number of actual requests that we enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11580)|
| 3:13:03| Those are phone calls that cover all kinds of issues throughout each of our departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11583)|
| 3:13:08| I anticipate the call volume to increase with taking over the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11588)|
| 3:13:14| I can't give you a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11594)|
| 3:13:17| Do you think it will double?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11597)|
| 3:13:18| It will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11598)|
| 3:13:19| I'm sure it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11599)|
| 3:13:20| Now in the past, and this is the reasoning we're transferring codes enforcement under office neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11600)|
| 3:13:26| I'd say 85% of our phone calls and 85% of our requests are codes and zoning enforcement related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11606)|
| 3:13:34| So I think it will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11614)|
| 3:13:36| I don't know how much it will go up, but it will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11616)|
| 3:13:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11619)|
| 3:13:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11620)|
| 3:13:41| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to need to leave here in just a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| I want to throw out something, if I could, for consideration, not to consider now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11623)|
| 3:13:46| but for the body to be thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11626)|
| 3:13:47| If we could get the changes to the budget by Friday, is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11627)|
| 3:13:52| I know that we've talked about a lot of changes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| Yeah, there's really, we have talked about a lot of issues, but very few changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11634)|
| 3:13:59| but I'm happy to provide that by Friday, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11639)|
| 3:14:01| I know that a lot of people here are going to have recommendations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11641)|
| 3:14:05| I'm wondering, Mr. Chairman, if we could ask that those be submitted by our meeting on June 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11645)|
| 3:14:11| when we're meeting on grants, so that we can have a list of other changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11651)|
| 3:14:14| or other proposals that people might have so we can start looking at those, if that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11654)|
| 3:14:19| What do you ask for each individual commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11659)|
| 3:14:24| Yes, any commissioner that would want, who would have something about the budget that they would want to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11664)|
| 3:14:29| or enhance or whatever, if we could have that by June 11th when we're meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11669)|
| 3:14:33| perhaps we could talk about them at that time after we've done community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| That's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11676)|
| 3:14:37| But I think we need some type of process as to how we want to look at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11677)|
| 3:14:42| and any enhancements that we might make to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11682)|
| 3:14:45| Yeah, I would like to report those if you wanted to go through our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11685)|
| 3:14:49| or you could do it through the commission office, however you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11689)|
| 3:14:53| Commissioner Hammond, the mayor's current salary is $144,481.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11693)|
| 3:15:01| One, four, four, four, eight, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11701)|
| 3:15:06| So we could just make a list and send it to John on each individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11706)|
| 3:15:11| Yeah, I will be glad to consolidate those and present those on June 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11711)|
| 3:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11716)|
| 3:15:18| Everyone get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11718)|
| 3:15:20| That's going to happen after the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11720)|
| 3:15:23| That's what he proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| We can always talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11725)|
| 3:15:27| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11727)|
| 3:15:30| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11730)|
| 3:15:34| Allison, I know that Commissioner Moore had asked about the other professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11734)|
| 3:15:49| the $30,000 that you said had gone down to $20,000, and that's Pratt, Pratt & Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11749)|
| 3:15:53| Could you explain that to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11753)|
| 3:15:54| Who is Pratt, Pratt & Rice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11754)|
| 3:15:56| Pratt, Pratt & Rice is a firm that we contract with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11756)|
| 3:16:00| They do various projects that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11760)|
| 3:16:05| For instance, they're helping us get a federal grant for $4 million for restroom facilities at Seven Islands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11765)|
| 3:16:15| for a museum that is not staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11775)|
| 3:16:20| It's just talking boards and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11780)|
| 3:16:24| They're helping us get money for the regional water coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11784)|
| 3:16:29| and ridgetop development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11789)|
| 3:16:32| They're helping us with a grant there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| So it's kind of a grant writer, essentially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11794)|
| 3:16:38| Federal lobbyist, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11798)|
| 3:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| And then I guess my other question is, with regard to the new codes officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11805)|
| 3:16:50| who's going to be doing their performance evaluations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11810)|
| 3:16:55| Grant Rosenberg will be their direct supervisor, and he will be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11815)|
| 3:16:59| And is there any sort of technical expertise that you will have to factor into there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11819)|
| 3:17:06| I mean, since they came from codes and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11826)|
| 3:17:09| are there any sort of technical qualifications that they have that you have to evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11829)|
| 3:17:15| that possibly Mr. Weitrick is better suited for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11835)|
| 3:17:21| Grant has been working with the codes officers ever since we started the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11841)|
| 3:17:27| He is going to be certified to become a codes enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11847)|
| 3:17:32| I think that he has a pretty good handle on it, and certainly will refer to Bruce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11852)|
| 3:17:37| if we have any questions or need any help in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11857)|
| 3:17:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11864)|
| 3:17:45| The other thing, Mr. Troyer, I had asked you for the expenses on the senior summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11865)|
| 3:17:50| Could I please get those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11870)|
| 3:17:51| Yeah, we'll make a report for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11871)|
| 3:17:54| And that's going to be a combination of budgeted dollars as well as privately raised dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| And so, yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11879)|
| 3:18:03| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11883)|
| 3:18:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11886)|
| 3:18:07| John, you and I, we talked about we did this last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11887)|
| 3:18:12| and I think we need to do it again this year with the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11892)|
| 3:18:15| The tax rate is $2.69 per $100 of assessed value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11895)|
| 3:18:21| But it's really broken into three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11901)|
| 3:18:25| You've got the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11905)|
| 3:18:28| You've got the school's general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11908)|
| 3:18:32| And then you've got debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| And I think we need to, again, we moved $0.11 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11914)|
| 3:18:38| And I think we need to move some more of the tax rate to the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11918)|
| 3:18:46| Our debt is $62 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11926)|
| 3:18:50| And right now we have $0.33 coming in on the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11930)|
| 3:18:56| And that brings in, I'll have it here in a second, unless you know what it brings in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11936)|
| 3:19:05| What, about $27.5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11945)|
| 3:19:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11948)|
| 3:19:13| I just think, you know, when we talk about our tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11953)|
| 3:19:19| we need to be more reflective of what our actual debt is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11959)|
| 3:19:25| And you said you were going to take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11965)|
| 3:19:28| and see if we can't move some of the tax rate into general debt fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11968)|
| 3:19:36| and maybe move some of these other funds to the general debt, I mean general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11976)|
| 3:19:43| Have you had a chance to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11983)|
| 3:19:44| I think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| You start to think about, you know, some of the interest earns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11986)|
| 3:19:50| or the operating transfers, the CIC reimbursement, public defender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11990)|
| 3:19:57| those items together would be about $0.03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=11997)|
| 3:20:02| How about payment from general purpose schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| That's $4.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12006)|
| 3:20:09| What I'm thinking here is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12009)|
| 3:20:15| is there a way we can help the schools by picking up part of their debt payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12015)|
| 3:20:21| One of the things that the mayor has done, and he's been very aggressive on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12021)|
| 3:20:26| is that he has picked up the debt for $15 million of property, plant, and equipment upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12026)|
| 3:20:32| He's picked up the school debt for $40 million on Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12032)|
| 3:20:37| He's picked up the school debt for $15 million on Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12037)|
| 3:20:41| And that's showing up in your general debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12041)|
| 3:20:47| One of the things that benefit that comes from the payment from general purpose schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12047)|
| 3:20:53| is that the schools, now that they see that part of their debt has to come from their operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12053)|
| 3:21:00| their appetite for debt has gone way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12060)|
| 3:21:04| And I think that helps keep our debts down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12064)|
| 3:21:09| If we just pick up our debt payments, then their appetite for debt could increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12069)|
| 3:21:15| Well, if we can move what we can move over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12075)|
| 3:21:20| I think it's being more responsible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12080)|
| 3:21:25| I know that the cities, when you take a look at the city rate, tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12085)|
| 3:21:31| because when we look at TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12091)|
| 3:21:35| when the only part of the tax rate that stays with the county when you have a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12095)|
| 3:21:42| is what's in the general debt fund part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12102)|
| 3:21:45| In our case, it's 33 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| And although we have a lower overall tax rate than the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12107)|
| 3:21:50| when a TIF is done between the county and the city, the county pays more than the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12110)|
| 3:21:55| because the city has placed a higher, and I think it's somewhere in the 70, 75 cent range of their tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12115)|
| 3:22:04| goes towards debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12124)|
| 3:22:06| And that's probably pretty close if we were to take the $62 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12126)|
| 3:22:11| and divide it by the $814,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12131)|
| 3:22:18| You know, I think it shows the public really where our debt is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12138)|
| 3:22:24| because when you say we only have 33 cents of our tax rate going towards debt, I think it's misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12144)|
| 3:22:32| And so I think we need to try to move over as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12152)|
| 3:22:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12155)|
| 3:22:36| So I would be glad to make a report on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12156)|
| 3:22:38| And your point is well made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12158)|
| 3:22:40| You know, whatever is in debt service, thank you for sharing that, doesn't get put aside for the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12160)|
| 3:22:49| Well, that keeps tax dollars within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12169)|
| 3:22:52| And I think when the state legislative body passed the law that allows TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12172)|
| 3:22:57| and they excluded the debt part of it, they had a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12177)|
| 3:23:02| They wanted to make sure that counties and cities were making sure that their first obligation of paying debt got met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12182)|
| 3:23:10| And they didn't want that part of it to go out towards these TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12190)|
| 3:23:17| The other thing, Mr. Chairman, is I think we're going to need to take a look at having a special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12197)|
| 3:23:26| for just the budget to approve budgetary items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12206)|
| 3:23:29| I don't know if you have any ideas of when we need to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| but I don't think we need to try to do the budget within a regular scheduled commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12212)|
| 3:23:39| We've been here since 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| Your plan was to be done by 245.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12222)|
| 3:23:47| I don't see how we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12227)|
| 3:23:49| And I see you nodding your head in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12229)|
| 3:23:51| So I'm just going to throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12231)|
| 3:23:53| We're going to have to have a special called meeting, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12233)|
| 3:23:56| to just approve the budget and the other budgetary items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12236)|
| 3:24:01| And I don't know if we can get this done before our general meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12241)|
| 3:24:07| or if it's going to need to be done after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12247)|
| 3:24:08| But I do think we need to try to set that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12248)|
| 3:24:11| Well, we said that we were going to do it on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12251)|
| 3:24:14| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12254)|
| 3:24:15| That's community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12255)|
| 3:24:17| No, make a decision on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12257)|
| 3:24:18| Make a decision on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12258)|
| 3:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| That's what we said in our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12261)|
| 3:24:23| Well, everybody bring their calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12263)|
| 3:24:27| Commissioner Lamb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12267)|
| 3:24:30| This is off subject, but in this day and this interpretation of the sunshine law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12270)|
| 3:24:35| I don't know of any place else to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12275)|
| 3:24:38| Commissioner Hammond, I don't know if you noticed in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12278)|
| 3:24:42| the film commission just completely isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12282)|
| 3:24:46| I was wondering if perhaps me and you and Mark Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12286)|
| 3:24:50| or anyone else who has an interest in the film commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12290)|
| 3:24:55| and the future of the film commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| if we could get together for lunch one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| and discuss what we're going to do with the film commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12299)|
| 3:25:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12303)|
| 3:25:04| If you'd like to set a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12304)|
| 3:25:06| Any day is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12306)|
| 3:25:08| Your schedule is a lot busier than mine, so if you'll just throw out any day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12308)|
| 3:25:11| as long as I don't have something going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12311)|
| 3:25:15| Can I coordinate that with Joe Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12315)|
| 3:25:16| The media knows that we're going to set up a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12316)|
| 3:25:18| We'll properly notice them, and we'll get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12318)|
| 3:25:20| I do plan to make a presentation on June 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12320)|
| 3:25:23| as to why I think we should fund the film commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12323)|
| 3:25:26| And so I'll be happy to discuss that with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12326)|
| 3:25:28| and we'll make sure that the press is there at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12328)|
| 3:25:30| But I believe it's vital that we look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12330)|
| 3:25:32| and I'd like to make a presentation to this body as to why I feel it needs to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12332)|
| 3:25:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12337)|
| 3:25:38| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| You're buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| After lunch, I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12343)|
| 3:25:44| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12344)|
| 3:25:46| Yes, Allison, you're grant one can answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12346)|
| 3:25:54| I probably misunderstood Eric, but I thought he said he handled grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12354)|
| 3:26:00| Yes, sir, he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12360)|
| 3:26:01| Why are we paying a company to handle your grant there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12361)|
| 3:26:06| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12366)|
| 3:26:10| They work our federal delegation to make sure that we have the proper support we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12370)|
| 3:26:22| to push the grant through the federal legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12382)|
| 3:26:26| Well, how does Eric get these federal grants through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12386)|
| 3:26:31| A lot of the grants that Eric does are through the HUD Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12391)|
| 3:26:37| Ours can go through a variety of committees at the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12397)|
| 3:26:42| But it just looks like he would know how to do that because he applies for all the federal grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12402)|
| 3:26:46| That's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12406)|
| 3:26:47| I just couldn't understand why we're paying someone else to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12407)|
| 3:26:50| when we have someone that could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12410)|
| 3:26:53| This other thing is for Commissioner, I mean for John Troyer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12413)|
| 3:26:57| John, how's our capital asset condition right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12417)|
| 3:27:00| Do we have any life left in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12420)|
| 3:27:06| Well, let's go back to your question earlier on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12426)|
| 3:27:09| You asked about our change in net assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12429)|
| 3:27:13| Last year it's in the annual report that the change was a decrease of $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12433)|
| 3:27:19| You take out depreciation of $29 million, $29.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12439)|
| 3:27:24| and that from the traditional fund basis is a $12.1 million surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12444)|
| 3:27:30| But what that does point to, and I think you make an important point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12450)|
| 3:27:34| is that county assets depreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12454)|
| 3:27:37| You see that especially in an instance like the South Knox High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12457)|
| 3:27:43| Once it's underutilized or not utilized, then it depreciates very, very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12463)|
| 3:27:49| I think that also goes to the point of we don't want to keep anything any longer than we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12469)|
| 3:27:54| and I think that's part of why we want to keep a very close eye on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12474)|
| 3:28:00| Do you think our capital asset, we've got a lot of life left in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12480)|
| 3:28:07| I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12487)|
| 3:28:08| I think we're putting money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| If you look at the capital plan, we've got money for a variety of different facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12490)|
| 3:28:16| You look at the building maintenance piece of the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12496)|
| 3:28:19| and we've got money for a lot of different facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12499)|
| 3:28:23| But, yes, they are aging, and the number of new facilities are fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12503)|
| 3:28:28| because it takes money to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12508)|
| 3:28:30| Yeah, we talked a lot today on how much it takes to heat, cool, provide custodial services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12510)|
| 3:28:38| and, yeah, it's more expensive to maintain them too, and that's why I'm for fewer facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12518)|
| 3:28:45| Well, I wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12525)|
| 3:28:48| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12528)|
| 3:28:49| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12529)|
| 3:28:58| No one objects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12538)|
| 3:29:02| There'll be another hour, Hank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart2?start=12542)|
