| 0:00:31| Good afternoon and welcome to the May work session meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=31)|
| 0:00:46| As I always do, I'd like to welcome those of you who this may be your first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=46)|
| 0:00:51| Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| I also want to add and just provide additional clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| County Commission meets the third and fourth Monday unless there's a holiday of every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=57)|
| 0:01:05| The purpose of this meeting is a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| We will be discussing items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| We'll be setting the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=71)|
| 0:01:13| There will probably be some general decisions made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| However, the meeting next Tuesday is the meeting where it counts, where actual votes and things will be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=77)|
| 0:01:25| Tonight we'll also be setting what's called a consent agenda where we try to consolidate many of the items that are likely to be approved into one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=85)|
| 0:01:34| So just to kind of clarify for those of you for this might be your first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| Before we move into tonight's agenda, I will call on Commissioner Smith to say the pledge and then we will have a roll call by the Knox County Clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=99)|
| 0:01:48| So go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| If everyone would please stand and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=124)|

| 0:02:40| Okay. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| We will be going into public forum in just a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| After that, we will be proceeding into where we set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| I also might add for all of our guests tonight, we have a specially called public hearing tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| that is scheduled for 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| So when we go into working tonight's agenda, the work session meeting will be put into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| a temporary recess at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| We will then conduct the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| Upon the conclusion of the public hearing, we will go back into the county work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| So, you know, just some housekeeping there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| Now, moving into public forum, public forum, all residents are invited to come and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| to commission, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| And when you call your name, please approach the podium, state your name and address for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| the record, and go ahead and begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| So tonight, the first resident is Vivian Shipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=205)|
| 0:03:36| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Vivian Shipe, 109 South Gallery here in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| I come before you, the stewards of the Knox County budget, and I think it's fitting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| there are 11 sets of eyes on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| Wise counsel is found among many when deciding the fate and well-being of the citizens that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| It is the fate of a small faction of those citizens that I stand before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| It's not even a remnant of our people, for you represent 462,000 Knox civilians, according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| to the 2018 information of the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| I come to speak to you on behalf of the poorest of these citizens, the indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=259)|
| 0:04:27| The definition of the indigent is a person so poor or needy that he cannot or she cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=267)|
| 0:04:36| provide the necessities of life, food, clothing and decent shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=276)|
| 0:04:44| It's a person with no defense, a person with no voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| There is a proposal before you to cut the care of these citizens about 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| Please do not look at these people as dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| Look at them as souls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| What percentage of those people that will be affected live in your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| For it is the individual percent that you are morally responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| And collectively, as a body, you're going to be responsible for the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| These are people whose very incomes for many for a whole month are below $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=324)|
| 0:05:32| A whole month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| I understand you're our financial stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| I understand you're charged to be responsible with our people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| But you are also our leaders with the moral stewardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| You are charged with a responsibility to take care of the people of God that you stand and acknowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| I ask you not, do not cut this section of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| I ask you also to give the requested $200,000 increase that was asked to help the poor in this proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=360)|
| 0:06:10| This budget that was sent to you opens with a request for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| This budget opens with a request that reminds you of a charge that includes meeting the needs of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| And so I, too, ask you for consideration in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| I ask you to remember the poor among you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| I, too, bring you a charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| I charge you to meet the needs of the least of us, for they, too, are citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Our next guest to sign for public forum is Constance Evry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=404)|
| 0:06:54| Constance Evry, 301 North Charlie Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| As Ms. Vivian has already expressed, there is a 30% cut on the table for public health care pertainly affecting our poor people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=420)|
| 0:07:08| Police for Needs is a nonprofit organization that works and deals with the poor people directly day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| As a matter of fact, today we gave out four lawn care, four yards of free lawn care service today, literally today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| And I see the direct effect of how the poor are impacted by decisions that are made by the city and these councils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| as far as the city and county councils together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| And I'm telling you firsthand, if you make a cut into health care, it's not going to affect a few as some may think up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| It's going to affect many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| And I do mean literally many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| It's just beyond just down in Tent City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| It's just beyond East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| I am in South Knoxville heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| South Knoxville has a lot of poor people in that area that depends heavily on public health care services and assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| I've been out in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| A lot of poor people out there that depend heavily on public health care services and assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| This is not wise, nor is it in the best interest of this council to make such decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| I'm telling you, it will be detrimental in effect when you make these type of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| For example, there's a lady that sits in a wheelchair with her legs cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| She told me herself personally that it is through the health care of the health department that she was even able to receive the wheelchair that she currently uses today right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=493)|
| 0:08:21| There's another gentleman that's a veteran that I just came out of South Knoxville today cutting his grass for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| He gets his insulin medication from the public health department because he has diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| So these are the people that will be affected by such decisions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| I highly advise you all to not make a cut into public health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| It is beyond a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| I have children in my children's program who have injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| If it wasn't for public health care, they probably couldn't get any type of health care assistance that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| because the reality is that their families are so poor they can't afford to go to ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| So public health care is the only option, only choice that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Trust me, there are many people affected by this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| So I co-sign with Ms. Vivian, do not make this cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| And as she said before, the budget that is there for increase, make that increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| I'm telling you, there are many, many people that are in need of this health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| And as she said before, you are definitely dealing with the taxpayer's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| It is the taxpayer's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| It is the people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| And as we have already expressed numerous times through numerous council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| you all are voted here under trust of the people to do the right thing with our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| This is one of those real tests that stands today, to do the right thing with our money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| as the people can see and show, for those of you all that we voted here in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| to show us that you really are about doing the right thing when it comes to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| I need to see that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| And I hope that you all do do the right thing by, like I said before, not making this cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| And if anything, it's the opposite, actually making an increase to this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| I also have another guest who's asked to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| It's David Waite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| David, I hope I pronounced your last name right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| I'm David Waite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| I reside at 1011 Ledgewood Avenue here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| And I rise to speak about this issue about indigent health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| I have heard it said that perhaps this is a community issue and not a government issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=614)|
| 0:10:24| I was taught in civics class that when a community has a common problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| that cannot be completely resolved by individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| it organizes itself and forms a government to take care of those community issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| That's why the citizens in a democracy form a government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| to build roads, to provide fire and police protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| Those are issues that individuals cannot take care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| yet they are community concerns that need to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| I firmly believe that the people of Knox County, who are good and decent people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=660)|
| 0:11:08| are very concerned about taking care of the neediest among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| And certainly there is no one needier in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| than those who are so poor they cannot afford health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| So I strongly urge the commission to not cut the budget for indigent health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=684)|
| 0:11:33| and to, in fact, increase the budgeted amount for indigent health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| as has been requested by the different health care providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| Is there anyone else who would like to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| Ma'am, go ahead and approach, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| If you could please state your name and address for the record when you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=714)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I'm Louise Gornflow, 2306 Sunnywood Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| I urge the county commission to not reduce the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| for the county health department's indigent care program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| The proposed 30 percent cut will reduce primary care to uninsured county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| Before making such a drastic decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| I encourage the county commission to understand the consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| upon the lives that that decision would make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| The American health care crisis deepens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| We all know the health care system is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| Health care costs continue to spiral upwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| and an increasing number of households of all income levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| report they cannot afford as a major reason they do not have health care coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| The statewide rate of uninsured Tennesseans has risen to approximately 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| Ten percent of Tennesseans do not have health coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| And so that's 43, and this year another 43 additional state residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=782)|
| 0:13:10| without any form of health insurance joined those ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| Fifteen percent of Knox County residents have no health care coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=795)|
| 0:13:23| This spring, the state cut 128,000 children from TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| and 3,881 of those children came from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| The indigent health care program serves the poorest of the poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| those with incomes of less than $500 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| and these funds help reimburse the health care providers for providing care for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| When you just look at the dollar figures of a proposed cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| you cannot see the people behind those dollars who will suffer from this budget cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=834)|
| 0:14:02| I encourage you to rather focus beyond the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| You also need to know what such an action will mean to the people who have no other health care options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| So I encourage you all to not rashly make the decision to cut funding for this indigent care program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=854)|
| 0:14:22| Instead, this year ask the county health department to study and report back from you in a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=862)|
| 0:14:30| on the value of this program and the consequences that may result from cutting this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| And then, once you have that information, then you might have a more informed conversation around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=878)|
| 0:14:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Is there anybody else who would like to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| And if you could please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Todd Shelton, 3111 Foster Lane, South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| I did call in and put my name down, but I had possibly, was there a public forum for the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| Well, you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| We've got a, if you'd like to speak now, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| We do have a public hearing tonight that will start at 6 o'clock that we published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| It's, frankly, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| It's a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| If you'd like to speak now, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Otherwise, we do have another hearing that will start at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| I'll go ahead and do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| I've got two concerns, but both of them deal with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| My first one is, you know, the indigent care program that's been referred to before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=936)|
| 0:15:45| I also want to thank you commissioners for all the work that you do do, and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| I hope the commission will take another look at cutting indigent care for Knox Canyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| Currently, the budget cuts a 30% of the monies that were there for indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| It's interesting that Ronald Reagan's name has been used just recently to, as a president who was famous for being against entitlements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=965)|
| 0:16:17| It actually turns out that some of that was true, but he once said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| I have always felt that medical care should be provided to those who cannot otherwise afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| He backed up those words by increasing Medicaid four times in his tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| We need to take care of our working and nonworking poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| I hope there's a way that you'll find to fully fund the indigent care program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| My other comment had to do with the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| I am a member of an education coalition that worked hard on the budget over at the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1016)|
| 0:17:05| and we were trying to get the school board to make a good assessment of what they really needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| and make sure they came to the county commission with all of that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| While that didn't happen, they did come and with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| they have agreed on a budget that is certainly a large increase compared to the last three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| So we're happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| I think our concern is that the Knox County school system has slipped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1055)|
| 0:17:43| has been underfunded for some probably 15 years, and it's starting to really show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| whether it be the teachers' compensation and losing good teachers that go somewhere else to teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| just simply because they can't afford to work here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| or whether it's the size of the classes, classroom teacher ratios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| or whether it's the number of special teachers in schools such as social workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| mental health workers, and first aid workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| We feel that there are going to have to be some changes in how the school is funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| and so we go this year with the 22 million increase that the county and the school system has agreed upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1104)|
| 0:18:33| and we hope you'll approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| We'll be back next year, and hopefully we need to take another look at how we're funding our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1116)|
| 0:18:44| We're falling behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| Okay. Is there anyone else that would like to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| All right. We are now at the part in our agenda where we make amendments to the agenda and set tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| First, I've got several items that have been proposed that we'd like to add to tonight's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| and I see Commissioner Smith's light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Yes, sir, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Yes, Mr. Chairman, I didn't know if you'd rather us, you know, I have some questions for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Would you rather wait for now, do it now, or wait until we get into our budget session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| Well, I can tell you my, here's my take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| We do have a, starting in just about 40 minutes, we do have our public hearing on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1166)|
| 0:19:35| The budget discussion that I was going to recommend was to begin the budget discussion immediately after that public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1175)|
| 0:19:43| which we've duly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| We haven't had anybody sign up to speak at that public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| but that's not to say that somebody couldn't come walking in here with some additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| I'd like to at least, you know, subject to your all's approval, you know, maybe begin to set our agenda, conduct a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| I doubt that anyone's going to show up, and when the notice was placed for that meeting, discussion was not part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| It was just an opportunity to conduct an additional public forum specifically to the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| give the public one more chance, and then immediately upon the conclusion of that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| we can begin public, begin discussion within our group and asking Dr. Buchanan or other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| Does that seem agreeable to my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| Okay. All right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| So the first item I wanted to add to the agenda was an additional discussion on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| and I propose that we work with the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| following the budget hearing that is scheduled to start at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| I'd like to add one additional item, which is a discussion to set our follow-up conversation on the BMX topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| which the commission brought up in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| and I'd like to add a discussion item on setting a follow-up rules committee meeting in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| So, yes, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have one other addition, too. Do you want to do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| Yes, go ahead and propose that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| I'd like to make a motion to add, I guess it would be agenda item number 7, or slide in between 6 and 7, a resolution, R19-5-103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1270)|
| 0:21:23| It is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring Vance Link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| upon the 40th anniversary of his volunteer service to Knox Youth Sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| This is a proclamation for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| I've been working on it with the law department and was not able to get it in before this was printed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Okay. We'll add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| As far as now to call out the – that should cover – I'm not sending any additional lights, but that should cover the additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| Madam Clerk, have you got those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Okay. Now to go over the consent and non-consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| On your non-consent, we do have several items that are already on here that need to be formally added and deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| The deferrals are going to be item 6 and item 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| Susan Seymour cannot be here next week, so we're going to add that to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| 6 and 68 to be deferred to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| We will be adding items 48, 49, 59, 60, and 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| Those are already on your printed agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| The non-consent items are items 5, 6, 7, 9, 17, 30, 31, 39, 43, 45, 47, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1348)|
| 0:22:58| 55, 56, 57, and 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| One of those discussion items and something Commissioner Schoonmaker had mentioned to me prior to the meeting when we have a lot of discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| there may be some times where it's almost easier on the front end when this is published to schedule some at the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| and pass a couple of others forward to be discussed at the meeting just to spread them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| Commissioner Busler, you had mentioned a discussion item about hills, something related to new subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| At the meeting next week, I know that we'll probably have representatives from the Planning Commission here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| so it kind of struck me as one that would make sense to maybe discuss next week while we'll have folks from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| Okay, all right, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| So we'll go ahead and move that one to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| And Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Could you please list that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Did you say item number 8, 32 and 49?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Is that another one we wanted to pull from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Okay, so item 8 I did not say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Okay, so 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 17, 30, 31, 39, 43, 45, 47, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1439)|
| 0:24:26| Dr. Buchanan's item is on here, or the one about the health care that has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| I think the body would prefer to discuss that quicker than waiting until we get down to it on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| as it relates to our general budget discussion, if that's okay with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1484)|

| 0:25:08| Those were both the Development Corp. items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| Now, which of those were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1519)|
| 0:25:36| 8, 32, and 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1536)|

| 0:25:43| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| I was just going to say, feel free to move my discussion item to next week as well, if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| I don't think it's going to be overly lengthy, but it's number 57 on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| if you'd like to do that, just to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1554)|

| 0:29:13| Krista Baig, Knox County Benefits Director, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| We don't have a name currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| We're asking that it be moved forward to next week with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| I'm hoping to have our name confirmed by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| I'll make a motion we move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| A motion by Commissioner Smith, a second by Commissioner Anders to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| Item number eight, resolution 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| It's approving a memorandum of agreement with Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| at a cost of $46,800 for fiscal years 2020 through 2024| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| for services and deliverables to monitor and forecast enrollment trends of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| I'll make a motion to move with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| I have a question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Yeah, well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| We'll begin discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| So there's a motion to send forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| and a second was from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Is there discussion on this item, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| I also acknowledge Mr. Anders' flight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| Mr. Oaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Are you here, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1824)|
| 0:30:36| Sir, is this something we've had to do in the past with MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| We've got a standing protocol with them where annually they provide us enrollment projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1840)|
| 0:30:48| and population projections, and this agreement formalizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| puts in writing what we've been doing less formally for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| and it does it more or less at the same cost that we're paying right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Director Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1868)|
| 0:31:21| Sir, do we have an MOU with MPC for the services they provide to us for the money we give them annually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1881)|
| 0:31:30| I do think there is a MOU with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| I'd have to look it up to see what all it covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1896)|
| 0:31:46| Jeff Welch, Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| Commissioner Smith, we do not have a formal MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| We have a work program that is adopted by our planning commission that serves as outlines, tasks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| and activities that we do for both city and county, but it's not a formal MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| Does the city have an MOU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| No, they do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Or a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Do you know if this $46,000 is annually or for the four-year term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| This is a five-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| I believe it's five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| It's approximately $8,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| It's been going on since 2008, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Can you provide me with a copy of that working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| All the commission with a copy of that working agreement that we have with MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| Our work program, we can provide a work program to you, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| I was just going to ask along the lines of Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| We send them a lot of money, and every time we turn around, we're having to pay them for something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| I'd like to see that workflow and see what we're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| It seems like every time we ask for something, they're under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| I mean, if we didn't ask them to do a single study, we're still paying them a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| So just kind of figure out what we're getting for our money on the first end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| All in favor, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Item number nine, resolution 202,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| approving a letter of understanding with Nassau Utilities Board, KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| for construction of new wastewater facilities at Rita Elementary School at a cost not to exceed $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2007)|
| 0:33:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Can I get a motion for approval, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| There's a motion approved by Commissioner Anderson and a second by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Russ, could you tell us a little bit more about the stormwater facility here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| Is this part of our prior year capital plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| It's in the FY20 capital plan, and it's not stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| It's actually sewage, wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| And what we're doing is running the sewer line from Rita to connect to its current location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2042)|
| 0:34:11| And KUB has estimated that it will be about $600,000 to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| We currently have a small wastewater treatment plant on that campus that's been in place for decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| that we've been managing in concert with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| And it has become a significant problem and is in danger of failing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| and we feel like it's a good investment to go ahead and get us on the sewer and dispose of that plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| I'm not sure which of you chimed in first, but Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Mr. Erickson, what will happen to the existing plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| and will additional funds be needed to demolish that or to clean it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| Once we're offline with it and are on the sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| then we'll look at that and determine if we can demo it in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| or if we need to put funds against it to do that demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| And it's about $1,000 a foot to do this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| I don't recall what the foot is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| This agreement allows us to go ahead and the cost per foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| but this agreement allows KUB to go ahead and get a bid in place for that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| but it does not commit us to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| So once we have the bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| then we can make an assessment if we have the budget in place to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| But it's about 6,000 feet that you have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| That's why I figured it's about 1,000 a foot then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| If that's what the math works out, I'll agree with you, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2150)|
| 0:35:58| Is that in line with other projects around the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| What, the $600,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| We don't do sewer lines usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| This is the first that I can recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| and it's a number that we've worked with KUB on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| We have KUB here if you all wish to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2177)|
| 0:36:26| I did it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| It's $100 a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| No problem, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| New batteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| Any questions you want to ask at KUB, I can answer them, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Can you get it done in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Not 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| What kind of time frame are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| We are finished with the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| We have 14 easements to acquire, and then we'll go out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| And then, like Ms. Strokes said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| we'll look at it together and evaluate the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| That's going to take a few months to build, but it will go pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| It's a small diameter line, but it won't be very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Commissioner Besseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Are there any other houses that will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| or any other businesses attaching to this line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| or is it the single one line that's running to the main line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| It's intended to serve just the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| It will pass a few customers, 14, but it's built for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| If anybody additionally needs to get on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| we'll have to look at upsizing that line, but it's built for the school entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| So it's just for that one size of school, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| It's intended to serve one or two customers, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| but very few live down that corridor of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| But the intent is really to serve the entire school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| All right, thank you, Commissioner Besseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Would it not be wise of KUB, while they're doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| to partner with the schools and go ahead and install a line that is capable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| of continuing sewer on down Washington Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| We looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| The cost gets really cost prohibitive because of the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| It doesn't naturally drain down that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| So putting in large diameter sewer that would flow that would be extremely costly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| and then who bears that cost if you only add a few customers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| If more customers do want to participate down the stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| we will look at it economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Does that make sense for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Like I said, you could add a few customers to this line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| It's not a whole area of subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| And to be honest, with the railroad along that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| it really restricts your ability to attach many customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| because you've got to get across the railroad along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| So we looked at all options is what I'll say to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Seeing no other discussion lights, all in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| We're on Item 17, Resolution 210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| It's approving an agreement with the Knox County Community Action Committee, CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| for the provision of breakfast, box lunches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| and snacks by the Knox County Schools for the Summer Feeding Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| with service beginning on or about May 28, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| and continuing for approximately 43 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Okay, motion approved by Commissioner Anders, and the second was from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| Russ, could you tell us a little bit about this program, please, for feeding kids in the summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| Well, the program is run by CAC, the Summer Feeding Program, and we started working with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2359)|
| 0:39:27| I've been told, over 30 years ago, in order to provide meals for students that they identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2367)|
| 0:39:35| and that they provide services to at various locations around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| So we cook the meals and invoice CAC, and CAC reimburses us for our costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2380)|
| 0:39:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Mr. Oaks, this also provides some employment opportunities for your cafeteria staff that is also off during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| It allows us to keep some staff on for a number of weeks, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| Okay, Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| And I'd just like to speak to the issue of making sure our children in the summertime are connected to food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| but it also will give us an opportunity to help connect those children to a degree of literacy as they pick up their food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| And it is really, really important that we acknowledge the work that is provided by the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| to connect children during the summer to make sure that they have something to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| All right, thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Seeing no other discussion, all in favor of this item, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| All right, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Before I move on to the rest of the agenda, I wanted to thank and recognize some other folks who have joined us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| As we just discussed schools, I think it's appropriate to thank Superintendent Bob Thomas, who's hanging out in his corner back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| So thank you, Superintendent Super Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| We appreciate you being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| I also saw Sheriff Spangler here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| I think he's back there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| So he was here at the first part of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| I'm not sure if he's still in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Mike Hammond, I believe, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Mike, are you back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| And Nick McBride, Richter of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| Okay, Nick, where are you at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| He may have come and gone with the wind, and he's actually got something on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| So thank you, all of you, for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| The next item is number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Oh, and Louise Poplin from Farragut is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Hi, Louise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Sorry, I didn't see you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Item number 30, Resolution 411,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| is approving a contract with National Data and Surveying Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| for the provision of traffic data collection services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| All right, this is pretty interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Okay, is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| All right, motion, I heard, was Commissioner Carringer first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| and second was Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Okay, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| I'll be happy to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| or just give you a brief rundown of whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| Well, I guess this is under traffic data collection service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| What does that encompass, and is this something we're doing countywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| or is this one specific that we're looking at new developments, new roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| Is that where you're laying down the strips to see how many people are coming through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| if you could kind of clarify if this is an ongoing or a project-based contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| Sure, I'll be glad to, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Actually, this project started with the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| They do a lot of traffic counts, and we actually do a lot of their traffic counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| So we were looking for some more flexibility with scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| because obviously we only have a certain amount of traffic count capability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| and oftentimes the needs exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| So we wanted to get a contracted firm to do some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| This will include, like you said, the tubes across the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| that get vehicle information, vehicle classification, vehicle speed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| as well as even intersection turning movement counts to do signalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| retiming, speed studies, and things like that to serve the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| So it won't be used, from our perspective, that much just on an on-call basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| should our crews be busy or our equipment maybe be down at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Okay, all in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| All right, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Item number 31, Resolution 412.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| It's approving an amendment to the Memorandum of Agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| with the Knoxville, Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission, MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| for the development of a Hardin Valley mobility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| which amendment provides for an increase of $24,500 in the project budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| and at a time extension to July 31, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| Okay, motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Okay, motion for approval from Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| with a second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Jim, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Appreciate that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| Yeah, this does two things, as noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| It does add a little money to the contract, primarily due to a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| One, there was obviously a lot more public input than what we anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| and that involved running different modeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| that really wasn't foreseen within the project scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| and then it does extend the deadline of the project for, I think, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| So got a lot of good input from the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| and I just want to make sure that we capture all the information accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| Okay, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| Yeah, I was just going to talk to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| This is not just a silent problem out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| I mean, there's hundreds and hundreds of people that have come to multiple meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| The team that they picked to conduct this study has done a very thorough job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| with the public and the MPC and the TPO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| and I think we're going to get a lot of good information out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| We've got a history as a county of taking a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| and sitting it on the shelf because we're afraid of the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| but this is one of those future projects that we're going to have to look at and take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| So thank you, Jim, for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| I agree with Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| This is very, very definitely needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| What was the original cost of this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| It was right around $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| I don't remember the specific amount, but it was somewhere within that ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| So this will bring us to about $175,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| And the extra money is needed because of time to sort through and do analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| There was actually three different items that the vendor requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| One was obviously the additional public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| We just had a lot more public input than what we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| One was once we got in there, TDOT had some other alternatives that they wanted examined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| certain bridges and cross-connections across Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| So that was part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| And then just the management of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| we went from having monthly progress meetings to weekly progress meetings just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| every information was coming in with such volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| So it was just a lot more work than what I think was originally anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Did it require overtime work or hiring of new people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| No, sir, just additional staff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| A fixed cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| So what do we do after the study is complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| What's the process and what occurs next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| Once the process is complete, they will make recommendations for transportation improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| And then what you'll see is within subsequent fiscal years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| you'll see us prioritizing and asking for engineering funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| right-of-way funds and construction funds for those projects that are recommended as part of the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| And the study, I guess, will be summer or the fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| I believe the study should be complete within the next probably 30 to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| So probably next fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| you'll start to actually see the implementation of some of those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| or at least the start of the implementation of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| Okay, Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| So the total $172,100 that they now want to have to complete the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| that goes directly to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| So $6,000 was additional project management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| So they just overshot it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| I mean, they're getting a 16% increase in the deliverable, and they couldn't meet it on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| I'm seeing, Mr. Archer, I think I saw you stand up in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| Is that something you may want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Welch, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Yeah, Welch, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| I also acknowledge that Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Anders have both chimed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| but I saw you stand up in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| If there's anything, clarification again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| Both Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Smith and others have participated out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| There's close to 400 people at our first community meeting, almost 150 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| Second community meeting, we've gotten about 1,200 comments on our online input and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| and there's just been a lot to sort through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| It's taken, obviously, an additional 30 days more time to complete the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| and our recommendations will be shared with the commission, shared with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| you know, in the June, July, most likely July time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| I believe Robert Thurl would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see Larson's light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| So go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| I just wanted to add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| Commissioner Skinner, I think it's a little disingenuous to say they didn't meet the mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| and didn't meet the timeline on budget and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| I, too, participated in one of these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| and it was absolutely overwhelming to see the support from the Hardin Valley residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| and in a really positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| And any project with that volume of engagement is just going to take more and more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| I think they've done a thorough job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| and I don't think this is too much to ask to kind of give us over the finish line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| I'd love to see it in this corridor we talk about a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| So this first-hand experience, it was very productive, very well run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| and a great opportunity to see people participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Back now, I'll get the reply to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| I was just going to say I attended the first public meeting that they had up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| and it was an overwhelming thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| But, again, I think we have to rely on our vendors that when they're going to give us a project estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| that they're fairly close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| And since it's one of our basically in-house entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| you would think that they would be a little bit closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| and they've done studies for the commission and for the county for numerous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| And so I guess the red flag is when there's a 16% over budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| I think we need to have a conversation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| But I believe it is an important study as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Well, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| If I can chime in, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| It seems like, though, that we're punishing participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| I mean, if they make a bid and an estimate and more people show up and more people participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| then we shouldn't penalize them for having more participation from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| That's what I just don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Mr. Welch, so it's $175,000, and this program started when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| We began the contract, started in early summer of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| We did not initiate with data collection until September because we waited until school to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| so you don't want to collect data when school's not in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| So the immediate work began August of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| And these funds are going directly to the consultant, not ending in at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| What did MPC charge the city of Knoxville to do recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| $300,000 is what we retained a consultant for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| And that's lasted how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| Over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| $125,000 for that study more than this study, and that seems to be a much more enormous study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| There's been, obviously, a significant amount of more resources at the staff from the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| than there has been on this Hardin Valley community study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| I'd say Knoxville-Knox County plan staff has put in $200,000 to $300,000 at a minimum in that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| I've got one kind of pragmatic, I fall this into the hue type of questions for Jeff and Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| You know, we see mobility study, we see traffic study, we see comprehensive traffic planning and countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3140)|
| 0:52:27| You know, if someone were to walk up to me and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| we're looking at a mobility study versus a traffic study versus this or that, could you all clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| we've got about, our next meeting is going to start in about eight minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| but I'd like you to just go ahead while this is hot and it's going to come up later on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| can you provide some insight to say clarification for mobility study versus traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| and any different types of studies and what those entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| Commissioner, I can take a first shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| At least when I refer to like a traffic study, it's more site-specific based on a particular development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| residential or commercial or something like that, when you're really trying to identify the traffic impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| I'm thinking about the context of more of a corridor type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| Then as we're doing a, for the city of Knoxville, with a consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| a Chapman Highway corridor study of a seven-mile corridor where we're looking at access improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| safety issues, similar to what the commissioners asked the TPO to try to undertake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| a North Shore Drive corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| More of a corridor, what's going to happen within the corridor, the operation and management of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| Here at the Hardin Valley is an area-wide mobility study where you're looking at many, many facilities, many roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3222)|
| 0:53:50| your major Hardin Valleys, your Carmarcos, your Yarnells, Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| and trying to get a greater assessment of what's happened currently underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| what's going to happen in the next 10 to 15 to 20 years with potential growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| and what, based on that growth, what would be the transportation or mobility impacts on the area-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| So that's how I see it as a comprehensive mobility study, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| So, not putting words into your mouth, but you describe a mobility study as a little bit more comprehensive and more regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| versus a corridor study which is a little bit more just about focused on a particular corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| This is a traffic study, yes. And we do regional transportation studies too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| If you were, so a corridor study could be part of a mobility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| I mean, what is the difference in terms of detail and deep dive if you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| just definitely in terms of a mobility study which is more regional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| inside of that there's going to be different corridors that are going to be studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| So, I think you know where I'm going with this, but I mean, so what would be the difference in data collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| if you really need data on one corridor which is part of an area-wide mobility study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| Is there going to be any difference, or how does that shake out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| As Jim was alluding to, some of the traffic count data that, you know, the item before this was on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| there you would look at specific potentially turning movements at a number of intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| look at the specific traffic counts feeding into it, really hone in on traffic crashes and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3313)|
| 0:55:21| look at delays at intersections to see what kind of improvements would need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| potentially be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| So that's where you really do more of a deep dive on corridor statistics and corridor information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| But yes, as part of a regional wide, and again, looking at a corridor study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| you want to somehow look at the impact also the region growth would have on that particular corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3337)|
| 0:55:45| Corridor studies could be a subset of a regional area-wide study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| All right, that motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3360)|

| 0:56:08| Madam Clerk, what's our next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Item number 32, resolution 413.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| It's authorizing the execution of a waiver of certain restrictions applicable to property in the Forks of the River Industrial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| owned by the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| and leased to Keurig Green Mountain Incorporated, formerly known as Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3385)|
| 0:56:34| Okay, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3396)|

| 0:56:46| Just briefly, I know we want to get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| Mr. Law Director, you may want to chime in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| This is the only body that can grant the permission to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| and this is for further expansion of Green Mountain Coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| Yeah, and as I understand, I know they've got it for potential expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| They just need to get this rolled in so that they can accommodate potential for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3427)|

| 0:57:17| Is there a motion to put this meeting in recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Okay, a motion by Commissioner Anders, a second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| County Commission is in a temporary recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| In approximately three to four minutes, we will begin the budget meeting, the public hearing on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3450)|

| 0:58:15| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| All members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Madam Clerk, next item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Item number 39, resolution 702.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Moving in amendment to Knox County contract number 18-068.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Actually, Madam Clerk, I think when we set the agenda, we agreed that the first item we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| would discuss when we come back from this meeting would be the budget discussion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| we added at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Well, I guess we're through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Well, just as discussed, it kind of makes sense to have that discussion immediately after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Speaking of the one that you added to the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| General budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Yeah, I have some questions for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3535)|
| 0:59:09| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| My first question is, and I have four or five questions that I want to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| We are not denying services to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| The same amount of services will be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| What this is doing is changing the amount that the provider receives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Our partners that we work with, Cherokee Health and the hospitals, will provide services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| They just won't be getting paid as much as they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| How many people does this program serve, and what is the medium cost per patient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| This program serves about 1,100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| That's the cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| We don't usually go to that cap for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| If you do the math, the budget had been $4.3 million for 1,100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3600)|
| 1:00:11| Chris is better at math than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| Chris is going to get his calculator out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| But that's the estimate of how much it costs per person to provide this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| How many people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| About 1,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| Do we ever get information back on the amount that the service provided costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| 2,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| 2,700 approximately per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Do we ever get information back on what the amount of services costs the providers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| If we actually pay full price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Yes, we have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| I do not have it in my head, but we do have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Basically, Cherokee gets a set amount of money to provide care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| and then specialty physicians bill us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| and they're paid at approximately 15% of what they bill for the services they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| Then the hospital charges by patient day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| and their average rate of pay for this care has been around 6% of hospital days they bill us for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3667)|
| 1:01:16| We don't pay the full price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| About 6% for hospital, about 15% of what's billed for specialty care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| Then Cherokee doesn't have a rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| It's just a set amount for serving 1,100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| Before I move on to my next question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| I want to make sure I'm clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| People will not be denied services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| We are simply changing what we are going to pay the providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| and the providers are okay with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| They're probably not happy, but they're okay, and they're not going to deny people service, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| They're not going to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| We are going to do our best to track that, to keep track of services being provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| and looking at referrals, we have that ability through Cherokee to look at referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| Are people still able to get in for specialty care at the same rate they were before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| We'll be looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Cherokee is committed that they will not turn anyone away, and hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| Again, nobody is happy when their funding is decreased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| but they are committed to caring for the citizens of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Okay, and does the city pay anything towards this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| The city does not contribute to this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| What do other counties do about providing this type of service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| Other counties, other metropolitan counties, some of them do subsidize what they call their public hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| and Nashville, now I'm blanking on the name of it, Nashville has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| Memphis used to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| I'm not sure if theirs is still open, but it's just a set amount that goes straight to the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| They don't provide for any primary care through their programs with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| and certainly no specialty care is paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| What are the qualifications for those in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| You have to have an address in Knox County, and that could be at CARM or somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| and then it's income-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| So if you are a single person who is enrolling on the program, you have to make less than $500 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3786)|
| 1:03:13| and then it goes up based on family size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Do we do any programs to try and help children get on TennCare and other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| I mean cover kids and people signed up on TennCare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| We do not, however, Cherokee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| So one of the reasons we transitioned enrollment in this program over to Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| because Cherokee has a, if you will, a menu of different options for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| So people might qualify for TennCare, they might qualify for one of their other federally funded programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| or they might qualify for our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| They have a sliding scale program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Folks who would qualify for this program are going to slide to zero on that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| because they don't have enough money to pay anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| So that person who's interviewing the patient looks at the patient and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| which program is most likely to best serve you, and they enroll them on that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| which we think is a good thing because it helps make sure you get the programs going to fit your needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| based on your life situation, your age, your medical needs, and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| Children are actively, we do not, again, we don't enroll children on TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| but Cherokee Children's Hospital and pediatricians across, you know, kids get enrolled on TennCare pretty regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3855)|
| 1:04:25| When they're born here, they're enrolled on TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| Cover Kids is a little bit different, and that enrollment, again, is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| I didn't say it was online, but TennCare enrollment now is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| Cover Kids is now online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| We do enroll pregnant women on Cover Kids, and we do enroll some pregnant women on TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| It's called presumptive eligibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| We've done it for years, but now it's an online program through the ACA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| How would the program be affected had the state opted to expand Medicare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| You know, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Not predicting is not my forte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| but we imagine that most of the folks that are on this program would have qualified for that expansion based on income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3900)|
| 1:05:09| When that was happening, we did actually have conversations about what that would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| and I told Chris consistently we would probably still have to have some folks to help case manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| and help people stay on care because that's been one of the challenges with the ACA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| is people who were not used to being insured became insured, and then they didn't realize they had to re-enroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| And so they'd lose their coverage, and it was a lot of work to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| I anticipated that we might still have to do some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| There are challenges, so we might need some money for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| but we anticipated being able to lower that cost and actually did look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| We even looked at would it be cheaper because, again, all these folks would be able to get insurance through the ACA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3947)|
| 1:05:56| Would it have been cheaper for us to pay their premiums to consider doing that if that would be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| We couldn't do that because when you put that low of an income in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| it popped up and said you qualify for your state's Medicaid program, and you couldn't go any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| Please contact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| Dr. Buchanan, thank you for all the hard work you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| Good questions, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Dr. Buchanan, what providers are in this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| I cannot name the specialty providers off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| The big ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| I mean the big hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Cherokee Health is the provider for primary care, so your family doctor, internist, that's Cherokee Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| Hospital care is provided by all of the hospitals that participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Not all of them see very many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| The primary providers are UT and Fort Sanders and Covenant Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| St. Mary's used to be one, but since they've closed, obviously they're no longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| And obviously that's a mix of non-profit and for-profit entities, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| Yes, it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| In this program, in years past, have all of those hospital partners, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| are they paid on a retainer on a monthly regardless of who they see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| or are they seen per the patient in a reimbursement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Help me understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Is it more of a sort of a block grant agreement, or is it more of a, hey, we saw 32 people and it's this price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| Yes, a little of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| Which we're changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| That's one of the pieces that's changing in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| If you'll look at that, that's a piece that we're changing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| So in the past, the way this was set up was if you saw less than 5% of the total number of patient days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4058)|
| 1:07:46| that were provided for the people in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| you got a small amount of money per quarter to keep an open emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| And if you saw above 5% of the total patient days for that quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| then you got paid a larger portion of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| So you got paid based on number of patient days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| They made it as comp – and we didn't change it, but it's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| So it's based on percentage of people served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| So there could have been people who were paid but didn't see anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| and there's some that could have been –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| There were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| That have seen so many more people and not been paid as much as that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| Okay, so that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| We're trying to level that out by taking away that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| So in the amendment that you have before you, which we're not – I know we're not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| but in the amendment we have on agenda right now, what you'll see is that that 5% cutoff is no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4112)|
| 1:08:40| You only get paid if you serve patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| So if you serve two patients, you'll get paid a little tiny amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| If you serve hundreds, you'll get paid more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| That seems a lot more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| Without getting too generalized in data and numbers that I don't have in front of me and hasn't been provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| would you agree that a majority of the indigent care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| the people that would fall under this indigent care program are within the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Absolutely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| We know that – I mean, we have that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| I can get it for you if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| I know the city is in the county, but it seems very odd to me that the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| where a majority of the people that would need this service contribute zero dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| To the program, and it is all on the backs of the Knox County completely in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| Has that always been the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| I've got to think about history just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| Yes, to my knowledge, because this program dates back to, like, 70s, maybe even the 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| And so it's been in place for a really long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| and it may predate when city and county health department used to be a separate city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| and county health department a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Because there used to be two different health departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| and the city went out of that business and the county, much like the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| much like the libraries, much like the jails, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| Director Caldwell, if my budget numbers are correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| I just want to make sure I'm accurately looking at the historical data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| Fiscal 17, almost $4 million is what we invested in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| Fiscal 18, a little over $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| Fiscal 19, a little over $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| And fiscal 20 is proposed, about $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Is that all pretty close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| I mean, according to my numbers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| Oh, thank you, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Yeah, Dr. Bee, when you talk about the $1,100 in the old contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| did we always spend the total amount, no matter if we had $1,100 in there or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| We did always spend the total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| This is not a budget we ever have any surplus in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| So it's based on the hospital piece is based on how many hands are going in the cookie jar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4272)|
| 1:11:21| If there are more hands in the cookie jar, they each get fewer cookies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| That's a terrible analogy, but I'm not at helm, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| Well, and the amounts, I mean, they probably rot off much, much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| than they even turn into the county for indigent care, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| Yeah, it's a great question for the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| I don't know how much charity care they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| So we were paying a set amount, no matter how many people we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| If we saw $850 in the program instead of $1,100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| we're still paying out the same amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| We did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| That's how it was set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| And how are we going to – so they're going to take that much less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4317)|
| 1:12:05| They're going to take 60% on the dollar of the 6% they were getting anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| Is that what you're saying they've all agreed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| Yes, they've agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| Because I'm a little confused that our providers agree to accept 60% less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| and I know the state of Tennessee opted not to expand Medicare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| I know this is where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| But I need to ask a couple questions regarding the percentage of people served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| and what are their medical services, because this cost is absorbed somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| So if you don't have access to care, that cost is absorbed somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| If you don't have your medications, that cost is absorbed into this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| because we're going to have to treat you at a higher and more intensive level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| because you don't have basic care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| So I'm a little confused as to how we're saying that we're still going to reach that capacity at 60%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4382)|
| 1:13:13| because if my illness is at 100%, who makes up the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| I just don't see how we are not going to be faced with higher cost somewhere in this system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4398)|
| 1:13:27| and who pays for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Well, some of those costs, frankly, will be passed on to the hospital systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| Cherokee Health is willing, is not going to turn anybody away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| That's from Dennis Freeman, their CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| Again, they have several different ways to serve folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| The other benefit to Cherokees is that they have a pharmacy in-house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| so they provide the pharmaceuticals, so folks are less likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| I'm not going to say they're not going to, but less likely to not get their medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| if they receive their care there, simply because they have that pharmacy capacity, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| Because you and I both know if people don't get their basic needs met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| they wait until there's an urgent need, and they show up in the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| And Cherokees are committed to reducing that risk for the people who come through their doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4452)|
| 1:14:19| whether they're on this program or on a different program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| Do we have a way to track what people come into the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| dealing with what specific medical issue all the way through the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| So if I come in as a diabetic or if I come in because I have just basic preventive needs that I need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| do we have a way of tracking what care people receive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| That's something we request from Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| As far as hospital and specialty care, we actually are now much better able to track that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| because my staff has worked on making it something we can track more easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| And I'll tell you, this is not a program where you go and get your brows lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| That's not what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| This program is for really basic medical care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| these folks getting insulin and antihypertensives, and we're not treating acne on this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4508)|
| 1:15:15| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| The reason I ask that question is because cost is associated with whatever health issue you're faced with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| and you're saying Cherokee and the other providers have agreed to lower costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| just to have just basic preventive services because you can have lots of illnesses and disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4529)|
| 1:15:37| and who's going to absorb the cost of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| So they've agreed to take less money from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| and Cherokee has agreed to enroll these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| and continue to care for them through the other funding sources and other programs that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| They haven't said that's going to be easy, but they've agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| And the hospitals provide a large amount of charity care in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| and will absorb some of the cost of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4561)|
| 1:16:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Okay, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Dr. Buchanan, in your list of accounts sandwiched between dental services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| and food and restaurant inspections is something called emergency medical service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| What exactly is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Okay, hang on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| Let me find the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| That pays for the E911 Center as well as some funding for the Knox County Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4589)|
| 1:16:40| It pays some funding to the E911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| And I thought with the cell bills, your cellular bill every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| you're paying a fee for the 911 Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| So this is in addition to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| It's for dispatchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Yeah, that doesn't remotely cover the charge of 911, the cell bill and phone tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| And in addition to that, that covers a portion of the salary for one of my employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| who has oversight of the AMR contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| So is it $570,000 that's going to the E911 or $166,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4631)|
| 1:17:18| $166,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| $166,000, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| A couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| I was looking on page 12 of your budget in your book here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| and it has like general funds up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| It says general administration, finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| It goes down and you get to public health and welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| The adopted budgets under 2018-2019 gives these different amounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4661)|
| 1:17:48| and then you go to the proposed 2019-2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| and when you come down to public health and welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| I guess that's where the health department is, their budget's underneath there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| The year 2018-2019, it said $23,367,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4680)|
| 1:18:10| but the proposed budget for 2019-2020 is almost a million dollars less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4690)|
| 1:18:18| Was there a reason why that wasn't proposed that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| Because every other category seems to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| That would be the decrease for energy care that we were discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| that went down about $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| So that's the mayor's proposed budgeting funding for the health department this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| which was reduced because of this reduction in indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| The increase would be for salaries and benefits and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| or other changes made in that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| We're beginning to get back to some folks who have already asked questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| so I've got to ask a couple of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Dr. Buchanan, I guess, one, going back to one of the comments from earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| I guess I just want to maybe hear it again or just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| because one of the questions was around health care being provided specifically by your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| And as I understand, that's not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| I've been to your department quite a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| and we're really talking about our contract agencies, just to clarify again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4755)|
| 1:19:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| We've also got some great providers in Cherokee Health and like UT Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| that I think of the role of UT Medical Center with their ER for the whole community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| as well as the baseline of health that I see that I know Cherokee Health provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| I mean, earlier we talked, you had mentioned how sometimes there may be more reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| for folks who are getting more services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| I mean, do we see, what is the breakdown of folks who are maybe receiving primary care from Cherokee Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| which would be more of a traditional doctor setup, versus, say, ER care for primary health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| You might not have all those details, but I know to a certain extent that's kind of what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| is we do have folks who might be going to the ER at UT Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| and part of this is to help UT Medical Center provide that service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| versus also the general primary care, as I understand, through Cherokee Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| Let me clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| So in order for UT or Covenant or anybody else who's a hospital to get paid to provide care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4823)|
| 1:20:31| they have to be seeing an enrolled person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Like you're enrolled in your health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| This is not a health insurance program, but you get enrolled in it based on your income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| and based on you have an address in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| So Cherokee does that enrollment, so you have to enter through the primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| So you establish with primary care to meet your basic needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| and then if you have an emergency like a heart attack or a car wreck or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| then you would go to a hospital and they get a little card that says they're enrolled in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| The hospitals all get a list, actually, of the people who are enrolled so they can double-check that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| and then the hospital bills us for those days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| and we double-check it against our list to make sure they were actively enrolled in the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| when they went to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| So those are the lives we're covering with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| You get enrolled, you have a primary care provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| and you also have emergency care and specialty care as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| So because of the enrollment piece, does that make it a little bit easier, frankly, to track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| It does, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Are there lots of people who would qualify for this program, end up in the emergency room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| that we don't know anything about? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| I mean, just because they don't get enrolled into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| Navigating our health care system can be complicated for us and for lots of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| Cherokee does their best to try to work with those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| and the discharge planners at the hospital do their best to try to get those folks connected to care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| when they're leaving the hospital, but that doesn't always happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| I think one of my fellow commissioners, or two of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| had talked about how it seems like the majority of the participants tend to be folks within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| versus some of the more rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| Has there ever been any kind of pushes to offer these enrollments to folks out in the more rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| of our county that might also be working poor, that might not have access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| Just curious on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| We haven't ever gone out and done an enrollment event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| We have relied on folks to have awareness and come to get the care that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| It was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| When we had the program at the health department, folks came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| The majority of folks that qualify for this, because of where the services for these folks are located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4966)|
| 1:22:54| closer to the city center, that's where most of them live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| because they're also accessing the social services offered by CARM and Salvation Army| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| and other service providers who are really co-located within the city center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4983)|
| 1:23:11| So that's been the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| If anybody, I mean, all you have to have is an address in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| Antidotally, I seem to recall when Briggs and Massey both pushed for the health care expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| and then when it didn't get passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| I remember specifically wondering how that could translate down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| That's my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| For now, back to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| Okay, you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Just a few more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| All right, and then I've got Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| Actually, Commissioner Jay, you had spoken earlier, so I want to, according to Roberts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| I want to get to Briggs, and I see that Commissioner Carringer is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| All right, go ahead, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| You said you're a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Can you give me the time stamp on how long you have to be considered a Knox County resident before you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| Technically, it's supposed to be 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| but for folks who are at the mission, that's sometimes hard to validate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| So you're supposed to be a resident of Knox County for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| But that can be something from the mission that says they've been staying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Okay, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| I want to say that our city and our county, I can't imagine us not having Cherokee Health System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| I mean, they are a blessing, and we're very privileged to be able to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5070)|
| 1:24:38| Having interactions with UT, with husband and daughter and daughter-in-law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5078)|
| 1:24:45| they say it all the time, every day, we don't know what we would do without Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| So one thing I wanted to point out is when they come through an emergency and they may not be admitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5090)|
| 1:24:59| and so we don't know about it, but a lot of times they are admitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| and I know my husband and daughter have referred people over to Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| and they call and they have their social people work all this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| So they do get, if they come to the ER, they get admitted, and they're not on this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5111)|
| 1:25:19| then they do get them on that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| So I'm wondering, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| They do the best to get them on any program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| Sometimes it's this one, sometimes it's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| The discharge planners do a lot of work to do that, the discharge planners at the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| Even the ERs now have discharge planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| so it's not just the inpatient folks who get access to a discharge planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| And they know about the program, but like all follow-ups, sometimes it doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| so they do the best they can to get away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| And I know all of the medical staff everywhere, they're committed to, that's their oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| they're going to take care of, they're not going to turn anybody away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| So on the decrease that we've heard and we've gotten e-mails from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| that we were given a 30% less, is that's really just in the way of restructuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5171)|
| 1:26:20| I mean, we're not providing less care to our indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| We're paying less for that care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| I mean, that's the best way to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| The county is going to be paying less for that care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| But what we need to make known is that we're not denying anybody their services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5193)|
| 1:26:41| or that they're not going to have this service anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| Cherokee's dedicated to continue to serve the folks who are uninsured and underinsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| And like we all know, our hospital systems do provide a lot of charity care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| But again, we are committed to working with Cherokee and looking at this and evaluating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| Well, that's why I want to make sure that the public and everyone knows out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| that Knox County is not taking away any care for anybody that needs that care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5231)|
| 1:27:19| That's what I want to make sure that everybody is aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| and that gets put on the blogs and in the paper and in the news and everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| that it's just a different way of doing the math and that our facilities have agreed to take less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5247)|
| 1:27:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| And to Commissioner Nystrom's point, this is not impacting anything that we do at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5255)|
| 1:27:43| We'll continue to provide prenatal, not prenatal care, sorry, family planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| We don't do prenatal anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| Family planning and immunizations and STDs and TB care and our HIV clinic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| So it's not impacting those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| Immunizations for children will continue as they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| So that won't make any changes to that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Just a few questions for Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| I noticed on page 35 and 36 of the proposed budget, these are defined service contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5294)|
| 1:28:23| It proposes to support VMC for $10,000, the Mental Health Association for $10,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| free medical clinic for $5,000, and the Interfaith Health Clinic for $56,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| And that health, it is a note there that says health care for the working uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| Would that, would some of the same people fall under that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| or would that be a different sort of classification of people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| Dr. Buchanan looks like she knows the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| It is a different group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| So we have a great working relationship with Interfaith Health Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| and so where their enrollment begins based on income, ours stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| Got it. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| So if you make $501, you go to Interfaith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| If you make $500, you are in the injury care group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| So it is an investment in public health care to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| It is just a different level of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| Commissioner Jay, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| This was for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| I don't have any questions for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| We'll step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| Chris, can you remind me again on the payments to cities, the $155,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| what exactly that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| That's for our contribution to EMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5381)|
| 1:29:48| And we pay the city because it's really a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| It's viewed as a city department, so we pay the city for our piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| And then I had talked to your staff about changing some names on some accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5396)|
| 1:30:05| I found another one you may just want to take a look at, and it's 5165.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| I think that name of that was abolished in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| even though you may just call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| And I want to acknowledge the hard work of the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| and Cherokee and all of our providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| But I want to make an observation to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| why should we pay providers less when the cost of our medical care is so high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5438)|
| 1:30:48| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| I apologize for being out of town for the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| so I'll have a few questions and comments that probably could have went in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5455)|
| 1:31:04| Chris, we've had a long-time conversation over the last three or four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| in the county and the school system about CTE, and it's kind of been one of the hot topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| We have not, in this proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| the only increase in CTE programming is what the teachers would get in a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| Why is that, and why are we not moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| We talked a lot about getting kids ready for careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| Why are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| I know we've got some things going on in the discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| but why are we not funding some of these programmings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| or increasing the opportunities for these kids to leave our high schools career ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| I think that's more of a school-related question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5507)|
| 1:31:54| I'll ask that of Dr. Roswick or Mr. Thomas, anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| We've talked about it, and we've even proposed Carnes or Byington-Solway at Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5520)|
| 1:32:13| It's doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| It's producing some good students that are walking out with credits that they can walk into, certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| We know that there's empty jobs out there for welders, and yet we're just sitting still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| So why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| A couple things with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| We are focused on CTE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| Some of the way that it's funded, the positions are funded for those of the same way that we fund staffing positions overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| based on the number of students, especially at the high school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| Based on socioeconomics, based on the ADM or the enrollment for those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| they earn so many staff positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| and by that, principals make decisions as far as English positions, math positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| and then kind of the electives or the career tech ed positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| So all of our high schools have programs for that kind of design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| We've worked closely with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| We actually had all the principals in to meet with the chamber this last semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| and kind of look at what industries were around them that they may partner with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| Dr. Wilson, our CTE director, has done a great job building that out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| So they are in the staffing formula to be used that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| and all of our high schools offer programs for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| So what we're working on now is really a program we're calling advances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| to try to have every one of our high schools to have an advanced academic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| kind of what you see at the IB program at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| There's another program called Cambridge that we want to bring in, and also AP and pre-AP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| With that, we also want to have a robust CTE program at every one of our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| And what we're trying to do is kind of a shift in the thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| In the past, we've kind of had a smorgasbord of options for students to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| So you have one teacher teaching maybe four or five different types of topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| You might have a culinary arts next to a shop kind of class next to an auto mechanics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| And what we realize is you can't get the depth of programming with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| So making a shift to more, you may need three health science teachers to get that level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| and really build a program and also work with the chamber to bring a partner in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| who wants to work with that level of programming at a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| So that's been something we've worked hard on this year and trying to work at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| The other part is making those connections to partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| We've done a lot of work with UT, a lot of work with Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| a lot of work with our TCAP to try to bring in and build some of those programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| in ways that we haven't in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| So the commitment is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Most of our CTE program is funded through federal funds, through Perkins, Carl Perkins funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| But we also have, out of our general purpose, we also fund our positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| We have five specialists that support our CTE programs in each of those areas as well as a director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| So that focus is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| I think the biggest thing we're going to see is those partnerships build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| as we build the programming correctly at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| We have some good traction in some of our schools for that to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| So I think the state's focus on industry certification has not been there in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| The State Department now awarding extra credit for or extra points for industry certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| is really turning the heads of some students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| We've kind of had this dichotomous approach to it where you're academic college bound or you're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| and that no longer exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| So we're glad to see that the state board made a change in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| where you get points for industry certification like you would an advanced placement course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| and we're starting to see families think differently about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| We've also moved to start adding some of that entry-level programming into the middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| We're going to try some health science intro courses in a few of our schools next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| as well as some STEM programs to get that first year knocked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| so they can get into more advanced courses for career, tech, and industry certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| by the time they finish high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| What's stopping us from such as having a trades high school that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| I think Bang & Solway has four feeders and Gibbs and Halls have to trade students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| and Carter trades students with other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| Why would we not have a, and I know that, you know, the health sciences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| I mean I know that we're not just talking about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| but the trades is where we're really lacking as far as kids walking out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| and either choosing not to go to college or not able to go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| Why would we not just have a trades high school that is nothing but the trades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| and they get their high school diploma while they're there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| Why would we not try that approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| That's a good question, and I think something that has been done in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| that's kind of the more program for probably about 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| where you kind of had, what kind of had to happen where you kind of had dual paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| where students who were maybe stronger academically kind of stayed in this college-bound track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| and students who weren't maybe went to more kind of trade schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| And I think what we're seeing is it takes a highly sophisticated student to enter the trades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5813)|
| 1:37:00| with the manuals and the level of literacy that's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| and I think, you know, we really push for that being done at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| Well, I didn't separate the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| I didn't say that that couldn't be a trades high school that didn't have great academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| But, I mean, you can only get so much if you're on the bus a couple hours a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| going to and from your school where you're getting your training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| And so you're missing out hours every year by traveling from one school to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| And so why wouldn't we not have a great academic trade school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| like we have a great STEM school downtown or we have a great IB program at West or the Career Magnet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| Why can't we have a great academic trade school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| Well, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| I mean, that would be one way, but I think what we would rather do is build out that type of programming in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| So like welding is an example of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| We know in a surrounding county there's one organization that's looking for 300 welders by June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| They have 88 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| And so I know our CTE director has been in conversations with that organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| and also with Carter and Gibbs that are on that side of the county to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| you know, let's revitalize a program and be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| What we also see is families want to, by and large, still play football and be in the band and do those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5892)|
| 1:38:19| And so we believe every high school should have both of those opportunities as well as all the extracurriculars that go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| So sometimes when you pool and kind of sequester to one place, that does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| I think a school like STEM has a market for some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| I think what the partners that we're trying to bring into, we have enough in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| and, again, working with the Chamber, what we realize is we don't have a FedEx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| We don't have one big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| We have a lot of smaller companies, and they're close in community to a lot of these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| And so I think that's, you know, to me, I think there would be a better approach to be able to do all that within those communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| and build that out as opposed to trying to recruit students away out of the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| Does a STEM student have the opportunity to play football or basketball at their own school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| They do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Or do they give that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| They give that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| I know John knows what I'm probably going to say, and I hate that that even has to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5953)|
| 1:39:20| but this is the second year, and I have to look after my schools in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| This is the second year that Central High School has been, I guess, thrown under the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5966)|
| 1:39:33| and we're losing our principal this year because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| And this is a man that came from Farragut High School who absolutely led them to excellency at Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5979)|
| 1:39:51| and he has done the same at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| Needless to say, my community, the parents, and a lot of the staff is very upset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=5994)|
| 1:40:03| and it starts all the way from some of the elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| and then I just heard from one of the middle schools to the middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| I've been real concerned about some cuts, whittles, and aggression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6012)|
| 1:40:19| But the one thing that I want to bring out and kind of would like to know, the parents are very upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6019)|
| 1:40:30| We went through this, the same thing last year, that Mr. Reynolds was going to resign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| because he was losing teachers and staffing and not being able to offer more classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6035)|
| 1:40:42| So I know we're all wanting to lower suspension and absentee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6042)|
| 1:40:49| but when you make cuts to certain schools, you're going to increase that amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6049)|
| 1:40:57| because then you're putting more teachers per class, and therefore there will be more discipline issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6057)|
| 1:41:04| And I like to compare Carson-Southdale High School, which is in 9th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| but Fulton High School and Central are my two high schools, and they're really pretty much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6071)|
| 1:41:21| In terms of the population and in terms of the diversity and all in those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6081)|
| 1:41:33| but for some reason Central and Southdale just got Title I this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6093)|
| 1:41:39| so they're getting their additional money, and Fulton is a project grad school and also Title I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6099)|
| 1:41:47| So they get their money even though you make cuts. Central High School does not get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| When they get cut, they get cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| And Central High School has gone through, you know, we're the only school in Knox County that had a shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6115)|
| 1:42:01| And things were kind of beefed up there for a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| but then we had a lot of people transferring out of Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| and I'm talking people born and raised in that area, that were like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| well, I guess we can't send another generation through Central High School because of what was happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| And now we have built that back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| And John has a daughter at Central and one at Gresham also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| So now we have been building that back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| and it seems to be every time we get a school back up to where community is thriving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6149)|
| 1:42:37| and the parents are coming back and they're moving back into the area and they want to be a part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| we start taking away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| So this time when it was presented, then Mr. Reynolds says, that's it, I'm out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| So now we're waiting on who is going to become the next leader of Central High School and with the staffing cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6168)|
| 1:42:58| So when do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| And also it had us losing students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| But come to find out, and we discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| we know for sure six students had applied to transfer into Central High School and was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6190)|
| 1:43:18| So it's kind of like they don't want our numbers to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| And they said, well, that's because most people want to transfer out of Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| So my question is, how do we have so many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6208)|
| 1:43:36| We have more students, I think, at Central that speak English as second language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| but I realize that doesn't go into the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| Or how many get federal money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| And so, you know, I guess since now it's really out of the school board's hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6226)|
| 1:43:54| I mean the vote on our budget in terms of for our schools and for our schools, it's up to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6234)|
| 1:44:02| And so I'm listening to the people in my district, and they are very, very upset about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6242)|
| 1:44:10| And I don't think, I think the people there have sat back, but now they're kind of tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6250)|
| 1:44:18| And a lot of our north schools, Evelyn, same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| I mean, that's why we are very much pushing for a new Lonsdale Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| Adrian Burnett, that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| I mean, our north schools, and I go back to where these were original city schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| and it's really like we kind of keep getting thrown under the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| And I go back to what you just said about the STEM that they were thinking about putting in middle school, a different program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| Well, Shenandoah Elementary was one of the first elementary schools to even have STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| And their foundation helped support, they supported that teacher's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6290)|
| 1:44:58| And so, but now, this year, they've come in and have cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6298)|
| 1:45:06| They were a pilot for the elementary schools with STEM, and now that's been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| And so you have Inskip, Shenandoah, most of Sturkey, and Fountain City that feed into Gresham, all these feeder schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6312)|
| 1:45:23| And we've got really upset people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| And so, you know, I said, I'm your voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| So I'm just trying to figure out why we kind of keep getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| And there's Super Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| Yes, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| And let me just step in and just say, too, first of all, we haven't thrown Central under the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| We offered a retirement incentive, and the principal chose to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| Now, last year, we worked with the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| We have to be equitable with our staffing, and across the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| because of reasons with what you mentioned, Title I, federal funding, and we can't supplant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6357)|
| 1:46:04| But last year, we added back four positions to Central High School, probably in the neighborhood of $280,000, unbudgeted positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6364)|
| 1:46:13| Well, I know. I know that happened because our foundation, Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| I mean, we've got a whole new energized group of parents that are attending Central High School that are taking a step up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6377)|
| 1:46:30| which has not been in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| But it was with a lot of meetings and a lot of, you know, anxiety there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| Or, I mean, if they had just sat back and said nothing, the cuts would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| Well, and we looked at the staffing formula this year, and we actually added back an assistant principal and also a guidance counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6403)|
| 1:46:51| I think those two positions were added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| We're going to look this next year at our methodology for staffing to try to look at taking into consideration the underrepresented groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6414)|
| 1:47:03| like the ELL students and also students with disabilities and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| But, you know, and the Shenandoah position was 50% funded by the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| There was an agreement made by Buzz Thomas, who was interim superintendent at the time, to fund half of the position for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6433)|
| 1:47:21| Well, questions come to me about, well, okay, where's my half of the position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| He and the county. He and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| Yes. I mean, board members come to me, well, where's my position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| Again, we'll be glad to do a whole lot more things if the funding is there to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| You know, we've worked really, really hard this year to be transparent, to be equitable in terms of the staffing formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6456)|
| 1:47:43| and put the positions there that are earned through that staffing formula so we can be consistent across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6463)|
| 1:47:50| We have worked really hard to provide a raise for teachers and that well-deserved raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| We have outstanding teachers, outstanding administrators in our school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| We've worked really hard with reading and literacy and proficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| and I think we've done the very best we can do with the money that we are going to be earning, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6484)|
| 1:48:12| under the sales tax growth and property tax growth and what the state funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| So, again, you can only do so much with the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| And back to another high school, yeah, it would be great to have a trade high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| You know, it costs a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| And I'm not saying it's not deserved and not earned, but, again, how do you fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6507)|
| 1:48:33| And I'm not advocating, you know, you folks do tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| So my job was to present a budget that was within the revenue that provided by the state of Tennessee and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6518)|
| 1:48:45| That's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| That's the staffing formula that we used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| I really don't know, you know, what else we can do, given the circumstances of how we operate in terms of the revenue we're provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6529)|
| 1:48:59| You know, we were hoping for another $6 or $7 million from the state under BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| and, you know, thank the mayor for, you know, going to Nashville and trying to, you know, help and get the BEP looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| But, you know, the funding formula is inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| It doesn't fund the positions that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| So, you know, again, we're trying to do the very best we can, given the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| and we're not selling any schools short, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| John, you know, John has a daughter at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| I think if I tried to do anything to Central High School that he didn't support, you know, I think I'd hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6567)|
| 1:49:34| He'd be in my ear, you know, about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| So, you know, again, Mr. Reynolds retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| You know, that was his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| So, you know, he made it for whatever reasons, but, you know, we did not throw Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6582)|
| 1:49:50| and we have not and are not throwing any school under the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| Well, I think the fairness of this, when we've got all the diversities that South Dole and Fulton High School have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6594)|
| 1:50:03| the diversity there and the fairness of that you don't include English as a second language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| all the special needs that we have there is why we feel like that it's being, and it's the second year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6608)|
| 1:50:19| And when I look at all the schools, I mean, in terms of kind of, you know, of our original city high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| and all, Central is the one that's losing out in terms of that, and we're right there in the midst of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6625)|
| 1:50:36| But going to projected enrollments where they have us losing three students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| when we actually had six wanting to transfer for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| and we don't know how many else turned in that were denied transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| So it's like Central's numbers couldn't rise to acquire more teachers per ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6650)|
| 1:50:58| But how close, I know we all got this for Career Magnet, how close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| and I've spoke to John on this, that you really think these numbers are really going to be up to 300 students when Career Magnet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6662)|
| 1:51:13| because, you know, it's not been that high, and so you project a whole lot more for this Career Magnet school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6673)|
| 1:51:26| and as you know, if you drive around Fulton City, a house goes up for sale, it's sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| So people are moving into our area, and that's, I don't know how close this projection right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6691)|
| 1:51:43| All we know is what's been given to us in terms of the numbers, and, you know, the board we looked at, Career Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6703)|
| 1:51:51| we looked at the cost of Career Magnet Academy, made that presentation to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| Community came and convinced, you know, talked to the board about keeping it open, so, you know, we kept it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6716)|
| 1:52:03| So, you know, hopefully what they're going to do is those numbers will be right, and they will grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| and they'll be a more viable high school, but the smaller your school is, the more it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| You have administration, you have custodians, you know, teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| So, you know, people want to look at our budget and say, well, you know, how come you don't have the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| Well, you know, we looked at this over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| We've looked at Knox County schools, and it's probably a product of putting two school systems together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6744)|
| 1:52:30| Schools are not in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| If you could start over and build a school, they're not in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| So we have many, too many schools, actually, and when we look at the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| and we compare ourselves to other school districts who can do more, they have more, their schools are larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| they're more efficient, but nobody wants to close a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| Yeah, we have a lot of our older schools that were our city schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| Mr. Chairman, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| Our discussion is on the general budget, not one school, and it's also not in our lane, our preview, to be over the school's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6776)|
| 1:53:04| But we fund it, Randy, and we get the blame for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6784)|
| 1:53:11| All we do is fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| All right, thank you for your point, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| Mr. Thomas, can we turn a light on and we can grill him some more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| No, I've got this question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| We've talked about this before, and education goes in two forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| One, you have academics where you can learn that way where people can be self-taught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| and then other people have to be doing to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| So we know we've got two tracks of education, and one of the things you touched on was CTE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| and when you first brought in the STEM, I asked, why couldn't that be in all schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6824)|
| 1:53:51| Well, we're going to have to go that way some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| But some other things that you didn't touch on that wasn't in the budget here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| do you have a robotics class done through your schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| Most of them I see as clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| They're not sanctioned or going through the schools, but the schools do support it in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6844)|
| 1:54:11| The other thing about the CTE teachers, I've talked to a couple of them that have retired in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| One of them was an auto mechanic, and he said, why I quit was not that I didn't want to teach anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| He said the industry has left him, and all the things that he knew no longer apply to the new technologies we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6862)|
| 1:54:29| How are we going to be able to keep up with those CTE teachers that are teaching these things that are changing so fast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6869)|
| 1:54:36| And how are we going to recruit those teachers that have experienced it, touched it, done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6876)|
| 1:54:46| and be able to take that knowledge that they have and give them to those students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| so when they walk out the door they're ready for those classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| And again, are the schools and the curriculum going to have to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| And like you said, we've got too many schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| When are we going to have to start combining them and be more efficient with the tax dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| Well, part of the problem with CTE teachers is the certification, the requirements to get certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6908)|
| 1:55:16| I know Dr. Reiswick and a couple of staff members went to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| We're looking at possibly being a system to certify CTE teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| where other districts might even send personnel to us to certify, and we do that for a cost, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6925)|
| 1:55:32| So we're looking at, in terms of expanding the CTE and being able to certify teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| because it is the requirements to get that certification have become more rigorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| So a person just can't have experience in the profession and then go teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| without making some significant contributions, I guess financially, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6948)|
| 1:55:55| in order to get that certification and going back to school and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| So we're looking at doing that in-house or through our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6958)|
| 1:56:04| In terms of what John talked about, the depth, I guess, in the curriculum, the industry certifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6964)|
| 1:56:12| I think the state recognizes how important the CTE program is in looking at industry certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6972)|
| 1:56:22| so that we can go more in-depth when a student gets out of school and has had that training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| then they will be qualified to go get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| So it's pretty, all of it's pretty complex, but I think we're making progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| and we're going to continue to make progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| And the reason why I was mentioning that, you know, there's only nine numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| and there's a zero there someplace, and ABCs are still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| We've still got the same number of letters in the alphabet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7007)|
| 1:56:52| but technology is changing so fast and things are happening so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| How can we do that and how are we planning for that in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| I know you're looking for plans right now, but we're losing a generation after generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| for them to be ready to go out and work and get a good paying job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| and the way the technology is happening all over the world, I don't see how we're doing it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| especially in our educational form that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| So what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| Do you have a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Is there a plan that we're looking at that we're going to address that problem now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| and get more on track quicker, faster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| Mr. Chairman, can I, I need a point of order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| I agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| We are way off the rails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| Our discussion is about the budget that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| These are discussions that should be done in the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| They should be done at the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| I acknowledge your comment, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| I did let Commissioner Carringer go on, frankly, a little long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| I'm going to let you wrap this up, but then as we move forward, let's try to keep it tighter to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| The reason why I'm saying is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| The money, if we do it properly within the schools, we can address the problems that you just told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7075)|
| 1:58:02| and you're the biggest part of the budget here, and we want to fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7082)|
| 1:58:09| but we don't want to fund it for something that's not going to work for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| So how do we help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| Where do we go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| What do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| And you really need to do these things that you're asking funds for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7098)|
| 1:58:25| Well, again, I'd be glad to present a plan to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| Again, we didn't come over here prepared to address questions like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| I mean, we'd be glad to do that, but we'd need a little bit of advance notice, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| before we come over here so we can be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| I apologize for that, but you just made a statement a while ago about the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| we've got too many schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| Who's going to close them and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| So you're just telling us the funds that we're trying to approve for you is not being used efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7128)|
| 1:58:54| Well, the reason I said that, too, was because of looking at the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| The funding only goes so far, and, again, the fewer schools you have, the more efficiently you can operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7139)|
| 1:59:06| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Let's get back to brass tacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| I don't have a question for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| Thank you for the work you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| My question is on page 15, which looks at the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| and the FY budget that is moving from $615,000 to $840,000, because my initial question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7162)|
| 1:59:33| and I'm not sure if we have people here to address the contractual language that occurs with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7173)|
| 1:59:40| and looking at the number of people we serve there in the contract that we have existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7180)|
| 1:59:48| And because the law has changed in terms of who we're going to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7188)|
| 1:59:55| I wonder why we're moving this level of funding to deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| when there are two key pieces that are no longer applicable for that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7200)|
| 2:00:07| I think we can still see both sects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| Now, what we've got to do is to determine at what level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| I don't think we're going to truly know until after a year to look at that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7215)|
| 2:00:23| We think through our provider that our number will stay about the same, 400 to 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7223)|
| 2:00:30| The challenge was, and for the increase, is the state, which we believe agreed to a three-year pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7230)|
| 2:00:39| says we're not doing that anymore, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| And so we, along with the city, made an agreement to go in 60-40 like the previous was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7243)|
| 2:00:53| change the program, let them go some in the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| but continue trying to get that population into the center of what we're currently coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7259)|
| 2:01:09| So there will be two avenues at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| And I know that they have worked with the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| which includes the attorney general and chief of police and the sheriff, to change that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7278)|
| 2:01:26| And I think ultimately, a year from now, we'll have a better idea if that is working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7286)|
| 2:01:33| if it's as successful as the current model is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| or by changing what the state changed as it moved the ball, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7297)|
| 2:01:45| Do we have existing data from the year that the center has been open and the impact associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| And at this point, who will be transporting people to the Behavioral Health Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| Nobody will be transporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| Well, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| There will be no transporting from the jail to the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| and so they're going to go to the jail to see that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| The other will stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| So as officers deem somebody could come to the center, if they choose to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| then they will take them and they'll be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| There is a data report that is out there for the first year of the center, and we'll send that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7341)|
| 2:02:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| And my last question is, do we track people as they enter, complete their stay, and exit into the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7350)|
| 2:02:41| I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| I'll have to look at that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| That report kind of details that, but we can get you that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| We've gone on extensively on the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| I'm going to take a look at my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| and see are there any additional questions pertaining to the school budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| Superintendent Thomas, you and your team are free to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| I'd also like to use some chairman's discretion on moving around in our agenda just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7390)|
| 2:03:17| for the sake of some of our guests that are here on a couple of different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| We've got a discussion item on KUB, and I know we have our KUB executives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| We also have an item that Mike Hammond has brought to us pertaining to the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7406)|
| 2:03:33| I would like to take a break on the budget discussion, which we will get back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| and get back to the Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7419)|
| 2:03:47| Hey, Bob, hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| We may end up moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| We'll move this to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| There is one other discussion item on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| which is a discussion item pertaining to the school security process for allowing individuals in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| Commissioner Carringer, you brought that one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| Do you mind if we move that to next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| So of those two items I just referenced, Madam Clerk, which one is first on the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7444)|
| 2:04:10| We've got a brief, I believe the KUB is going to be a very brief update on the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| So if you guys, Commissioner Jay, I'm going to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| You brought that discussion item to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| And if our team from KUB could join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| I thought this was a really interesting report that came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| and something that would be very important to the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| We often hear around the country people talking about drinking water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7473)|
| 2:04:40| We talk about lead, talk about whole communities that are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| And when this report came out, I asked Mr. Bolas here to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| and just give us a quick briefing because I think we have a very good report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| of how well we're taking care of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| I'll keep it about 30, 35, 40 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| No, seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| If you are a KUB customer, you received this water quality report last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7502)|
| 2:05:07| and so I'll reference it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| But I also gave you a one-page summary of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| I'll be really brief to say that our water, we do take it very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| the quality of our water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| We have a very state-of-the-art lab that we actually have on site at KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| It's one of the few in the state of Tennessee that's certified to do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| We do 100,000 tests a year on water alone just to make sure it's very clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| And I want to leave you with just some brief notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| If someone is concerned, no matter if they are a KUB customer or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| they'll have us call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| We'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| If that's not our customer, we'll refer them to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| But we want to know if people are concerned about their water to call us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| to make sure that we get it tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| We're making a lot of infrastructure upgrades at our plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| We have one water plant, MBW, Markery-Whitaker, built in 1926.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| Beautiful plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| But we have upgraded it and upgraded it and upgraded it to the point now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| we're actually building redundancy into that plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| We maintain 1,400 miles of pipe throughout our system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| and so we're replacing that pipe as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| In fact, Commissioner Carringer was talking about a project in her district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| they're working on right now, replacing water mains as they start to fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| before they fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| And so I want to just make you aware that we are blessed with a good water source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| with the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| But even with that, we do a lot of testing, a lot of certifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| a lot of things with our customers to make sure the water is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| for 80,000 customers, very pristine and very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| And if we do get any calls, we take them very seriously to react to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| Lead is not in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| KB does not have lead in its system at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| Now, some homes, older homes, may have some in their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| but even then we're lucky to be living in an area that's not real prevalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| But if someone's concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| we'll put them on their home inside piping to let them know what they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| or don't have and what they can do to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| So I want to make sure that you understand that and know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| I'd be glad to take any questions about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| But I appreciate you giving me some time to let you know that we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| a very good source of water here for our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| Commissioner Biggs has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| I've got a quick question, nothing pertaining to KB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| but just give me some knowledge real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| What would cause a utility district to lose, say, 43% of its water to the customer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7629)|
| 2:07:16| What would cause something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| What would be the remedy for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| Leaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7640)|
| 2:07:21| And there's two types of leaks I call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| The one that you see that's blowing out of the road, that's a catastrophic leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| Those are less common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| Most of it's old piping that just the joints start coming loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| Little holes start appearing and they just seep into the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| The analogy is it drips every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| and you're losing that throughout the system in different parts of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Usually it's older type pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| And so a lot of us are replacing those older pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| You don't see the leak, but you know it's occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| And so the older types, the pipes that are put in the 40s, 50s, and 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| are your primary source of that leakage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| and you replace those to other subdivisions, neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| and try to replace those as efficiently as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| That's your biggest source of water loss in a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| Is there any additional questions, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| If you haven't had a chance, I know that HPUD as well as KUB will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7689)|
| 2:08:15| for any commissioner, will give you a comprehensive tour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| and show you from where the water comes in to where it goes back out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| and everything in between, and it's a great education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| So don't hesitate to call on them any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| Is there any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| Regarding the Family Justice Center, Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| Is that appropriation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| Item 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7719)|
| 2:08:40| 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| Item 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| Number 9, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7723)|

| 2:08:47| Number 9, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7727)|
| 2:08:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| Item number 45, Resolution 903,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| it's appropriating $50,000 from the General Fund Criminal Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| excess fees account to be allocated to the Family Justice Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| for the program, Services that Empower Survivors and Their Children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7739)|
| 2:09:05| Mr. Carringer, you brought that one to us, I'll ask for a motion from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| I did, and Mr. Hammond is here, and Mr. Hammond and I started talking about this probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7748)|
| 2:09:16| a year ago, and it's Services that Empower Survivors and Their Children, so would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7756)|
| 2:09:23| like to speak on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| Well, before we go into discussion, can I get a motion and a second, then we can begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| discussion on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| Motion by Commissioner Smith with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I sent you a letter this week, and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| want to reiterate a couple of points in that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| Last year, the Family Justice Center had 1,478 children under the age of 15 come to the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7782)|
| 2:09:50| Now the research on this is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| Children who are the victims of domestic violence, or who are in a domestic violence situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| are likely themselves to become abusers as they become adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| Because of this, last month we presented you a check for $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| The number Mr. Caldwell gave us was $1,250,000, but our people wanted to see if we could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| the additional $50,000 for this program, because we see the effects of domestic violence every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7813)|
| 2:10:19| single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| This is needed for the kids, in particular, because we do not have the resources at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7821)|
| 2:10:27| FJC to adequately deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| So that's why we're asking for this $50,000 to be earmarked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| And there's a couple of things that we would like to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| First of all, it would be for therapeutic counseling, that money would help the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| with their coping skills, recover from the trauma of violence, and heal from emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| problems like stress, anxiety, and depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| The things that some of these kids see, some of the things that they have to endure, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| things that we really don't want to think about, we really don't want to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| but they are real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| And this is an opportunity for us to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| Now as I mentioned in my letter, when I was sitting in your seat, I wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7860)|
| 2:11:03| that the funds were accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| And so with that in mind, there are three things that we will do should you provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| this money to the FJC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| First is quarterly, we're going to give you the number of children served, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| to provide you with the types and the quantity of services provided to those children and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| the family members, and we're going to provide you with the impact of counseling and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| therapeutic services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| So you're going to know very quickly if this is working and if the money is being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| for what we have said it's going to be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| I know you know it will be, but I think that as commissioners, you want to know the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| and what impact it is having on the children and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| So with that, Amy Dilworth is here, she's the Executive Director of the Family Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| Center, if you have any specific questions you would like to ask of her, but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| ask that you provide these funds for the Family Justice Center, specifically earmarked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7919)|

| 2:12:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| Okay, this will resume back to the budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7937)|
| 2:12:22| We have not closed that discussion item out yet, but we did knock those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, but we've got some people from Parks and Rec that are here also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| about an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| Remind me which item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| Number 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| Yes, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| That one was pulled from consent, and I think that's the next one on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7960)|
| 2:12:49| We can go ahead and knock that one out and then get back to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| Can I make a suggestion that we go ahead and finish the agenda and then go back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| Because there may be some people here that could care less about the budget, but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| are here for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=7982)|

| 2:13:51| We were having some issues with some safety issues out on North Shore out at Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8031)|
| 2:14:00| So we just felt like we already had a crew at Tarleton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| It just made a lot more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| Do you agree, Chuck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| It just made a lot more sense for our guys there to do Tarleton, and they're doing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8049)|

| 2:15:30| in the amount of $148,800 for a South Knox County transportation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8130)|
| 2:15:37| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| Motion to approve by Commissioner Anders, with a second by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| That was, Commissioner Biggs, you brought this originally to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| However, I see Commissioner Daly's light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| I'm going to call on Commissioner Daly, and I'm sure that, and Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| Whose light came on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| I thought it was Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| So, go ahead, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| As much as I would like to see a transportation study done in South Knoxville at $148,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8166)|
| 2:16:15| for Tipton Station Road, Hendricks Chapel, Martin Mill Pike, and Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8175)|
| 2:16:23| That is an extreme amount of money for those county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| We'll start off with Governor John Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| Governor John Severe Highway is scheduled for four lanes with the medium in 2030, 2032.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8190)|
| 2:16:38| If we can get on our state legislators, we can move that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| We'll start with Alcoa, we'll go with Alcoa Highway, 129.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8204)|
| 2:16:48| Once that six lane's done, traffic's going to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| Then we jump to Highway 33, Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| Maryville Pike carries traffic, but the only time it's really backed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8215)|
| 2:17:00| is if there's an accident on 129 Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| Plus, we've got a problem with underpasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| The railroad's probably not going to let us tear down an underpass to widen Highway 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8226)|
| 2:17:13| Then we go over to our next one that goes into the city of Knoxville is Martin Mill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8233)|
| 2:17:21| Martin Mill Pike, if y'all went to Twin Creek, that's Martin Mill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| How curvy, hilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| We've got two sections that are sliding off the side of the hill now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| Dead Man's Curve and just right before the S-Curves is at Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| So that's not a feasible extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| Plus, it's only two miles from Governor John Severe Highway to the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| It's only about two miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| The city would have to take over from there all the way into town through Vestal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| which I can't see the city doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| We've got Pickens Gap and Highland View on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| Pickens Gap has no sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| If this passes, as y'all know, I'll probably be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| If this passes, I'll have the MPC pull the building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| I don't know when a housing project is started on Pickens Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| We could use this $147,000 at the end of Pickens Gap to widen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8292)|
| 2:18:19| so it would make it safer for those people there on that one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| The rest of the road is a good road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| It don't carry that many. There's no sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| I don't think that very much of it has city water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| It's in the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| It's not in a growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| It's in the rural plan where it will stay rural for years to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| unless something comes up, a sewer comes through, which knocks Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8321)|
| 2:18:47| Running sewer, we just found out, is almost $100 a foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| unless you run into rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| Then it goes even higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| We'll go to Highland View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| Highland View will probably be the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| The new development that may be going in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| is about 150, 200 homes we don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| Those will exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| I would say 80% of them will exit Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8353)|
| 2:19:17| Chapman Highway 441 is being widened there in front of Bower Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| That will be a state, whether the state wants to put up a red light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8362)|
| 2:19:27| There's not enough traffic to control at Bower Field and Highland View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| The rest of them that goes down to Pickens Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8372)|
| 2:19:37| they're probably teenagers on the way to school, down to the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| That's a long way to travel out of your way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| if you're going to try to go to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| TPO, talking with KKCP, Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| I have found out that we're going to do an area-wide county study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| coming up this year sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| That's going to be paid 80%, hopefully, if it comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| 80% of it will be paid by the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| 20% of it by us in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| I say wait until we see if we get that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| and then we'll study the three roads that we may need there in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8417)|
| 2:20:25| I'm sorry, I cannot support spending $147,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| on roads that we already know are not going to be carrying roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8430)|
| 2:20:36| Kimberlin Heights and Hendron's Chapel has no sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| There's probably only been one or two houses built there in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| John Sevier Highway, Smithville, Wells Creek, it's only 68 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8445)|
| 2:20:51| That's the biggest development we've had so far out in the county in John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8451)|
| 2:20:57| You go to Gap Creek Market, you go to G&D Deli,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| you go to Love That Barbecue, you go anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| my question I get is are we going to take care of Governor John Sevier Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8463)|
| 2:21:08| That is our problem in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| I will be voting no on this just because I don't see spending $147,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8472)|
| 2:21:20| when we can wait and hopefully get that 80% federal funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8480)|
| 2:21:25| and do a small corridor type study, I don't think we need a full blown study right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8485)|
| 2:21:31| We need a study and Mr. Snowden can put out his traffic counters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| and tell us how much traffic is going down Tipton Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| how much traffic is going down Highland View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| We don't need to spend $147,000 to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| So I'm asking you to wait to vote no and wait until we get the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8506)|
| 2:21:53| Mr. Welch, you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| Have you all applied for that funding yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8516)|
| 2:21:59| Can you give us an update on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8519)|
| 2:22:04| Jeff Welch, Knoxville Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| The funding is given to our organization, the Transportation Planning Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8527)|
| 2:22:11| that we took applications earlier this spring to fund various projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| construction right of way and studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| So staff has made a preliminary recommendation to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| again Knox County provided a request for $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| for a countywide transportation road study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| We preliminary, our staff is recommending yes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| Our approval on the TPO Executive Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| which Mr. Nystrom is on that and Randy has been served on in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8558)|
| 2:22:43| will occur in the August-September time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| is when we'll vote to approve or not approve that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8566)|
| 2:22:51| You'll probably know in August time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| the money would then become available right at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| During that time, of course the county could go into the consultant selection process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| I'd say in six months to eight months you'd be underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| As much as I want to see South Knoxville grow and grow in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| there's no hurry here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| We need to wait the six to eight months until we get to the federal funding part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| Then I will gladly go with Commissioner Biggs and a joint resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| to do a study on these three or four roads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8607)|
| 2:23:31| But at this point in time, I just can't see spending $147,000, $148,000 on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8611)|
| 2:23:38| Hardin Valley, yes, I can see Hardin Valley needs that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8618)|
| 2:23:43| At this point in time, I just don't see spending this money at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| Okay, Commissioner Biggs, you made this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| I'd like to call on you right now just to clarify if you need to add in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| Commissioner Gill, I know probably what your question might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| if it was pertaining towards the different types of studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| Yes, and also Mr. Wilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| Okay, if you don't mind, I'm going to have Commissioner Biggs clarify the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| Whenever I started thinking about this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| actually it was from talks from different people around the South Knoxville community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| and I went, not with a closed mind, to think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| how with around seven million tourists coming into Knox County each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| it's time we do a transportation study across the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| And while I do agree with that study, it is vital to South Knox County's needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8669)|
| 2:24:34| we have a deeper scope of work diving into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| Mr. Welch can probably vouch for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| This study will be a deeper scope of work to look into this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| and I think we do need to look at Hendron Chapel, Highland View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| Pickens Gap, Martin Mill, as well as Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| We need to make sure that the safety analysis is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| We need to make sure that these areas also have things like guardrail implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| which in some areas, like Mr. Daley just stated, they aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8697)|
| 2:25:01| These priority South Knox County roads are due for improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| and this study will identify what capacity things need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| The data this study will provide will also show us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| where we can implement sidewalks and greenways for pedestrian use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| to help South Knox County more walkable and enjoyable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| The detailed work that we will get from this study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| will help with long-time planning, and the funds from the South Knox study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| are coming from the budget surplus from engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| I appreciate you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| If you have any questions, I would appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| This statement was from Mr. Welch earlier when he spoke of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| and I know we look at traffic data collection, impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8744)|
| 2:25:48| safety studies, access management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| our area mobility, our corridor studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| I simply would like to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| what cost is associated with those studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| because they vary every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| we have somebody posing this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| and I know it is affected by the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| it is affected by the location in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| it's affected by what properties you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| it's affected by what properties you have to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| I know that is impacted by a lot of factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| but this number and the work you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| and the planning commission impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8784)|
| 2:26:27| every time I see a study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| and I know the level of work the county needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| in terms of all of our points of services is a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| but I'd just like to have an indication of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| and you can just send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| I'd just like to see what factors go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| into making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| At its simplest, if I might tag on to what Commissioner Gill said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| as we said, we were hitting the time stop earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| when this came up, is often we use interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| traffic study, regional study, corridor study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| and sometimes I think for both us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| and the general public it would be very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| both fiscally and as a definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| to present that information to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| I think just to restate what is the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| to clarify Commissioner Gill's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| although I'm sure you got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| We need a study to study our studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| I'll let you look at Wikipedia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| and you can get all the definitions you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| I've got a question for Mr. Snowden or Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| Come on up, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| You look like you want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8865)|
| 2:27:48| No worries. Be glad to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| In reviewing this proposal with CDM Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| it's quite detailed and quite a lot of pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| In your professional opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| what percentage of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8880)|
| 2:28:04| might be gleaned from this study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| that we would get from the area-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| County 1 TPO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| How much of this would overlap or would we get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| There would be some overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8896)|
| 2:28:19| This study is really going to drill down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| into more of the finite details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| in regard to existing road width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| existing crash locations, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| There will be some overlap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| but just ballparking it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| I would think that this study might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| be potentially as much as two-thirds extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8920)|
| 2:28:43| than what the mobility study or the TPO study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| would allow for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| That's a broad stroke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| This is a very macro-level examination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| of the roadways in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8935)|
| 2:28:58| There are lots of other studies going on currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| that overlap in this area as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| Two of them that were mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| City of Knoxville has a South Knox Corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| I know there is a County-wide Greenway study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| I might add that Mr. Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8953)|
| 2:29:16| does a great job with the John Sevier Corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| Are there other ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| The City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| has a pretty detailed Chapman Highway analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8965)|
| 2:29:28| that they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| There have been some other studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| A lot of those have been focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| on city routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| This would focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| primarily county routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| as well as main state routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| in and out of the city for the main generators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| like your growing community of Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| and the airport and how to move traffic efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| and safely from those major points of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| In your department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| you're constantly looking at crash data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| and congestion data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| You have a pretty thorough team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| constantly looking at everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| from constituent complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| to safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| You guys are doing that on a pretty regular basis, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| We get the Titan system that the Tennessee Highway Patrol uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| The city KPD and Knoxville sheriffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| actually put all their crash data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| At the start of each calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| the state will actually give us a data dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| that we can put into our GIS system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| and look geographically at where those crashes are occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| Oftentimes, my staff doesn't have the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| We're looking for those hot spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| that you can see on a large map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| We don't have the time to really drill down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| into the details, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| This may be a question for Mr. Welch or you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| We've referenced the Hardin Valley Mobility Study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| versus what everyone has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| is our fastest-growing area of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| Are the same levels of growth happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| in this proposed area as are happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| in places like Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190520?start=9086)|
