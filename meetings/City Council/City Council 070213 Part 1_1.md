| 2:18:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| 12P, an ordinance approving the request of Michael Smith for a one-year plan amendment from low-density residential to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8340)|
| 2:19:08| for property located on the northwest side of Dutch Valley Drive, southwest of Plummer Road, fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8348)|
| 2:19:17| We do have someone signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| Charlotte, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| I reside at 104 Crawford Road in Fountain City, and I'm here to represent Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:33| The property in question is surrounded on three sides by low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:40| It's a small parcel with no opportunity to provide a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8380)|
| 2:19:47| As part of the planning process for the North City Sector Plan, years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| it was decided that Dutch Valley Road would be a buffer between commercial to the south and residential to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8393)|
| 2:20:02| The North Sector Plan is currently being reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| And when the MPC staff came out in October to talk with folks in North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8406)|
| 2:20:14| Dutch Valley was discussed, and the general opinion at that time was that it should remain the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8414)|
| 2:20:23| At the January MPC meeting, the staff recommendation was denial of the C-3 rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8423)|
| 2:20:32| but the commissioner settled on a rezoning to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8432)|
| 2:20:37| The area just north of this parcel is heavily residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:43| and our concern is that if even office rezoning is permitted, that it will allow a potential encroachment into this residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8443)|
| 2:21:01| As Michael Kane pointed out in the letter that you have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| when interested and concerned citizens take part in the planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8467)|
| 2:21:14| then revisions resulting in long-term consequences should be made through sector planning, not by piecemeal rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:23| We ask that you deny this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| That is the only speaker we have signed up on that issue, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| Oh, please, come down then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| If you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| My name is Paul Garin of Garin Land Surveying, 4525 Bucknell Drive, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| I'm here on behalf of Michael and Wendy Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| The Smiths have a small window siding operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| They've been working out of their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| Mr. Smith about a year and a half ago bought this piece of property, unaware of sector plans and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8515)|
| 2:22:01| and they were hoping to move their business over there to Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:07| We were trying for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| Hopefully we could store some materials there in the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| Realizing that that was impossible, we tried to get it moved to office just so we could move the office over to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:21| No other reason than for domestic harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8541)|
| 2:22:26| And we would hope that you would approve MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8551)|
| 2:22:32| Are there questions from council members or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| Have you all talked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| Have you all talked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8558)|
| 2:22:39| No, I thought at the MPC meeting everybody was okay with O zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| I read the minutes, and clearly Ms. Davis was there and said she wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8564)|
| 2:22:48| So you all haven't talked about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| Is there any value in you all talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| My tendency is to think not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| I would like to, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| I don't want this to die right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8576)|
| 2:23:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8580)|
| 2:23:01| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| Can you all talk in the next two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| Yes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| Charlotte, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| Actually, I really don't know what there would be to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8590)|
| 2:23:14| It's either going to be residential or it's going to be office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| And our feeling is that if even if it's office, it's going to be the beginning of the end of the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8597)|
| 2:23:27| So we would prefer, you know, I mean, either, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:31| certainly office is better than commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8611)|
| 2:23:35| But that's really beside the point when Dutch Valley is supposed to be the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| I tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| And I think the question here is, as Mr. Guern, I guess, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| it's sort of a question of we've had these planning processes that have said, keep Dutch Valley as a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| We just had the long discussion about how much we respect public processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| And I think you feel, I mean, you said, I don't want to see it killed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| So I think you're getting a sense of where things are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| I'd actually like, Ms. Davis, for you to take two weeks and talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8641)|
| 2:24:05| especially to see, you know, pick Mr. Donaldson's brain and see if there is a way to work something out on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8645)|
| 2:24:15| I don't think this council wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:16| And I'm definitely not going to support any changes that would allow an office zone to cross Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:23| But to see if there's a possibility of something that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| And, Ms. Davis, are you willing to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| I'm going to make a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| Can I ask if you're willing to make that a motion for 12P and 12Q since you couldn't do Q without P anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8676)|
| 2:24:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8682)|
| 2:24:42| I'm going to make a motion to postpone for two weeks, 12P and 12Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| I heard a second from Vice Mayor Brown, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8688)|
| 2:24:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8691)|
| 2:24:52| Does this mean Councilman Becker will get his P's and Q's right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:57| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8697)|
| 2:24:58| Ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8703)|
| 2:25:10| Next item is Ordinance 12R, an ordinance approving the request of Lisa M. Bird for a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8710)|
| 2:25:17| from medium density residential to office for property located on the northwest side of Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:25| northeast of Smithwood Road, Fourth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| Ms. Davis has also signed up to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| Charlotte, we have your address, so you can go straight into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8735)|
| 2:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| In 2003, a use-on-review was approved for this property to allow construction of the current medical offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8738)|
| 2:25:45| within the existing R2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| Fountain City Town Hall did not oppose this use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| To our knowledge, the current medical offices are economically viable, and there is no proven hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8754)|
| 2:26:03| Our opinion of Fountain City Town Hall is that it's not good land use planning to allow changes to occur every two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8763)|
| 2:26:11| to three years for property uses and rezonings, that frequent changes in land use are unfair to communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:22| and to those who take an active interest in development or redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| Therefore, we ask that you deny this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:32| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| If you could come down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| I think council would love to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| My name is Lisa Bird, and I live at 5235 Bent River Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:44| Questions for Ms. Bird?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8804)|
| 2:26:45| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| Mr. Becker, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| I guess, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| I guess, can you explain why you need the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| When I bought the property three years ago, it was R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| And I used an architect, which at this time I don't remember his name, but it was a firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| And it was R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| They said we wanted a medical office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| My husband is a physician, and so we wanted to go ahead, and instead of renting, we wanted to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:13| So the architect said, why not just leave it R2 because you either could do apartments, church, or a medical office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8833)|
| 2:27:21| you know, one of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| What we knew was going to do a medical office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| The architect said, don't open up anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| You know what's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| Leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8848)|
| 2:27:29| And I said, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| That's what we'll do, based on the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| My husband is a physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| I'm a nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:34| You know, this is something new to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| So I took the recommendation of the architect to go ahead and leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| At this point, what we have is I have a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| I have a physician next door that's renting from us, plus us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| As I had said, an MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| And actually, it was kind of, you know, I think a funny thing in a sense, but that's what they made it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8870)|
| 2:27:55| That, you know, I said, in case something happened to my husband, then I have to find just the physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8875)|
| 2:28:01| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:02| I have no other recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070213d1?start=8882)|
