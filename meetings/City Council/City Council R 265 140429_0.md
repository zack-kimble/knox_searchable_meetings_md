| 0:03:31| our annual report. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| that each of you should have a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| of it. I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| that you've had an opportunity to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| but I want to just take a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| moments and highlight some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=221)|

| 0:03:49| to say that this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| to 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| decrease in the number of cases that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| was brought to PARC. In 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=237)|

| 0:04:03| 89. These numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| suggest that the efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=245)|

| 0:04:13| with citizens and neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| interested in improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=255)|

| 0:04:19| present and relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| I want to commend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=263)|

| 0:05:43| that they may not want to do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=343)|

| 0:05:59| Thank you. I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Yes, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| I noticed on here you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| rudeness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| 32 complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| That's the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| number and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| violation, disrespect for attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=375)|

| 0:06:21| about rudeness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| Unfortunately, rudeness has always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| been one of the top concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| and the sector director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| works very close with Chief Ross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| improve in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| There's consistent, as I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| the sector director is on the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| committee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| being a part of that committee allows her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| but also I know that the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| is also conscious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| of it and taking their own efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Chief Ross, you want to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| respond to that? As Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| identifies these, it's really your responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Yes, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| What we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| understand is this is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| of our largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| complaints we all receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| There's also a dynamic that comes into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| because a lot of times, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| the director and I will meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| community members who file these types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| of complaints, a lot of times rudeness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| is an interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| of behavior that may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| actually be rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| It's a person's interpretation of their interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| and a lot of times what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| find is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| when they tell us what they consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| to be rude and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| check out the videos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| and take a look at the interaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| what we find out is a lot of times it may just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| be that the officer wasn't overly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| pleasant with the person but they weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| necessarily rude. They were just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| type of person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| We have worked on that with our folks as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| talking about, matter of fact, I spend a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| time in our training talking about the human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| factor and that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| important that you take time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| communicate clearly and politely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| That has taken place quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| As I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Avis and I spend a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| working with folks in the community that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| these types of complaints and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| really drilling down into what it is they mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| when they say rudeness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=499)|

| 0:08:29| Okay, now for the Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| First, I want to thank you all for attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| the budget luncheon on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| It was certainly a beautiful day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| in Councilman Campin's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| in North Knoxville at the Christenbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Ball Fields. I thanked a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| of the people who participated that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| and we appreciate all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| but I think a special shout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| out is worthy to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| special events team, Judith Foltz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=533)|

| 0:08:59| recreation who do a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| the work to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| all of that pulled together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| And whoever was responsible for the weather, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| to thank them too. That was me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| That was you, Councilman Campin, we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=549)|

| 0:34:03| Very briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| not to sound glib, but it's a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| of the charter, specifically article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| numeral 9, section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| 901 E as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| echo says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| the Council shall pass the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| ordinance on first reading and thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| the Council shall hold public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| hearings on the proposed operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| budget as well as on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| capital improvements budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| and the said hearings on either budget may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| adjourned from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| There's some more to it, but basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| this is a provision that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| in place for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| and years and years, if not decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| upon decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| as Council's well aware, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| all have your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| public meetings coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| up on it where different department heads are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| going to come here, make presentations to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| present their information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| and engage in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| question and answer session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| not really any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| pros or cons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| being discussed in the budget tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| It's just the simple requirement of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| that it shall pass on first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Thank you. Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| I had, I guess, a different interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| of that provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| but just, you know, I've been, we got the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| on Thursday and I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| chewing on it quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| and looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| at it, knowing that this vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| was coming up tonight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| been talking to a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| of people, a lot of people said, well, it's been 10 years since a tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| increase, you know, sort of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| it's inevitable. It's the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| our tax structure is, that the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| rate goes down as reassessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| and that made sense to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| but then when you really, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| start to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| it's really not inevitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| and the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| reason we're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| to face this tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| is because of the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Just look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| That's the only reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| If you look back 10 years, in 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| and I'm getting this from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| City of Pigeon evaluation report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| of July of 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| the annual contribution to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| pension was $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| Next year, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| $23.4. That's an increase of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| $22 million in 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| You don't have to just go back 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| you can go back 5 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| It was $6.9, so roughly $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| That's an increase of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| $16.5 million in 5 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| we had had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| and again, we inherited this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| if we had had, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| a defined contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| there wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| this type of explosive growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| and this is what has led to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Two years ago, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| looked at this problem, I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| I mean, it was obvious once you start to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| that we're going to have to increase taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| to pay for this. And I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| stating that I didn't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| it was fair to raise taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| on a group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| to pay for the retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| without giving them the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| to vote to eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| pensions going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| We didn't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| that, so I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| it's fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| to increase the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| at this point, and so I will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| be supporting the budget and the tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| the provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| in the charter goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| you know, with all due respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| to whoever wrote that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| I think it's frankly an absurd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| provision to have in there to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| an elected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| to approve something. I mean, why even bring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| to us if we have to approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| It is in the charter, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| states that it's council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Not every council member has to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| I'm not going to be able to support 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| A and B. I would state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| if there's not five votes to support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| that we postpone it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| see if we can amend it to approve it at a later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| date, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Thank you, Councilman. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Well, I mean, I'm going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| weigh in on that. I mean, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| spent a lot of time on the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| We had, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| seven workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| We had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| discussion. We had a lot of input from all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| departments, the uniform and non-uniform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| where the pensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| This council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| majority of council, voted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| move forward to put it on a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| The majority of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| taxpayers, the vast majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| 76% of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| pay for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| voted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| change the pension, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| that we did a, we're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| diligent in our work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| and we vetted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| I think as good as we could vet it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| I think it's unfortunate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| we can't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| a process. I mean, we haven't even started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| our process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| and we're already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| we've come to dissension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| and I've got a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| I think it's a bad signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| We're talking about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| that has operated this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| for years and years, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| I think it's sad that we can't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| move forward in a civil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| not that it's not civil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| I think it's a little premature, I'll be honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| with you. I just have a problem with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| and I think that we'll do a good job moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| forward vetting it, and I guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| you there'll be a lot of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| but this council did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| its duty to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| sure that we brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| forward to the voters of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| a change in the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| We did so, and it's overwhelmingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| accepted, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| you know, I just want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| thank you, and I take exception to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Councilman Steyer. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| You know, I certainly don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| to be uncivil. That was not my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| we all, as individual members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| have to vote how we, what we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| is best for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| and an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| and the charter does not say each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| individual council member shall vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| in approval, so that's the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| I interpret it, and you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| I guess people kind of differ on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| In terms of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| voting to accept the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| I certainly don't, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| everything you said is correct. A high number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| percentage of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| public voted to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| but we really just gave them a menu with one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| option. It's sort of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| we gave them the menu with the steak, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| everybody ordered the steak, and we think, well, that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| everybody loves. That same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| election, the voters also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| approved a measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| to do away with the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| the voters spoke, I mean, so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| I mean, you can interpret that how you want, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| the voters also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| and the overwhelming majority, voted away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| to do away with the county's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| So, and you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| for note, the county's pension obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| last year I think was four and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| and it's going down this year to 3.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| In relation to ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| it's going from 16-something to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| 23.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| It's worth noting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Mr. Frost. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| Let me read a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| further on down in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| charter, and hopefully try to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| a couple of things, and I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| maybe I didn't go far enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| down earlier, but this is also in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| articles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Roman numeral IX, section 901,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| this is F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| as in Foxtrot, action by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| After the conclusion of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| hearings, the council may amend the operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| budget proposed by the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| except that the budget as finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| amended and adopted must provide for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| expenditures required by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| or other provisions of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| charter, and for all debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| requirements for the ensuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| year, as certified by the Director of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Administration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Finance. That just generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| there's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| verbiage after that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| you know, I'd submit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| if there are going to be changes, that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| after the conclusion, that it would be in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| with the charter after the conclusion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| public hearing, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| you know, Councilman Steyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| a possible interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| is, it says the council shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| pass the budget ordinance. It doesn't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| the members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| council, so I guess theoretically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| you know, if council passes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| with a 5-4 vote, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| passed, but my concern is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| and this would be a worst case scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| is for sake of argument, on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| first reading, the budget does not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| It goes 4-5, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| I don't have it in front of me, but from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| taking it a couple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| myself, you have, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| taken an oath to uphold the charter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Hopefully we won't get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| but what I'm trying to suggest is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| passing with a 5-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| vote is the same as passing with a 9-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| vote, but there could be problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| if there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| a vote not in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| favor of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Dellavapi. Thank you, Mayor. I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| to belabor this. I see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| difference between 12A and 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| I accept what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| tells us, and we have done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| in the past, that is, we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| on the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| really without a great deal of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| about the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| recognizing that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| have open public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| public comment, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| an opportunity to question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| directors of divisions and whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| to look at these numbers more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| So I don't have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| at this point with approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| the budget, understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| the real work is yet to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| and there will be some differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| of opinion. Now, when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| see 12B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| which is the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| portion related to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| frankly, I don't read the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| charter as requiring that to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| any time before the 15th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| day of the month preceding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| July 1, the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| budget year. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| the tax levy strikes me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| as different. It's an implementing arm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| to a budget we haven't decided upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| I'm going to be supporting the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| item, 12A, because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| we need to move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| to the hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| And like I said, I think that each of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| will have a chance to raise questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| about what we think about that, but I'm not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| to support 12B at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| I think it's premature. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| Thank you. I would just like to make this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Recently, there was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| dialogue in a blog about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| an issue with city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| back and forth among some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| and Dr. Lyons weighed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| and explained again what the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| was. And the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| who responded to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| said, okay, well, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| just keep on ranting about the way I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| it ought to be, and you can deal with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| way it really is because that doesn't seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| like much fun. And I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| that was a pretty astute observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| So really, what I had to do with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| budget is deal with the way the law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| based on the decisions that this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| made with recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| from the administration over the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| year on several issues, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| salary increases, on pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| and others. We've had those debates. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| made those decisions, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| budget reflects that, what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| obligations are. So I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| mind you picking apart the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| and I welcome you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| But know that we have certain obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| based on decisions that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| prior to today, and that's what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| budget, in terms of some of these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| reflect. So we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| a motion and a second. Is there any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| discussion? All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Yes, we have one, two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| one against this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| 12B is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| properties, real and personal, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| mixed, within the corporate limits of the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Knoxville, to provide sufficient revenues to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| the general fund and debt service fund operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| and debt service obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| beginning July 1, 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| and ending June 30, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Councilman Del Vecchio. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Let me just footnote a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| more on this. My concern is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| unintended consequences of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| this 34 cent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| tax increase. I mean, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| not hard to see in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| world around us that some cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| and some states are raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| taxes and losing businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| and some are lowering taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| and attracting businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| I don't know if you all watched the news yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| or saw it in the journal or some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| other paper today, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Toyota is thinking about moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| 400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| jobs, or 4,000 jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| excuse me, from California to Texas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| because of the lower cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| of taxes. And when we get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| a corporate level, people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| looking at significant taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| I'm concerned that we make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| more attractive that they move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| the county as opposed to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| or to Blount County or Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| And I want us to really look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| at that. And so the tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| part, in my mind, should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| come up at the time when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| nail down the budget and we're going to move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| with that, then obviously we have to appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| the taxes or authorize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| the taxes to support that. But it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| seems premature to me to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| it at this time. I was going to give you another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| example. Pfizer was in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| today, the large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| chemical slash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| pharmaceutical company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| and they're planning, at least trying to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| AstraZeneca,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| a company based in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| England. And the reason they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| do it is they're going to move, if they get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| they're going to move their corporate headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| to England where the tax rate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| corporations is 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| as opposed to New York where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| currently based, where the tax rate is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| 40%. And they're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| potentially a billion dollars of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| saving. Now, in this city, our taxes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| nothing like that. But when businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| have a choice, they look at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| line. And I'm concerned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| some of the things in this budget, there's a lot of great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| things in this budget, and you had a great presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| at the budget luncheon, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| are some things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| maybe we can't afford in a tight business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| year. And so I want to see us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| a revenue year, I want to see us look hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| at that, and I'm going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| against the tax increase at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| recognizing that whenever we get a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| we need to have taxes that support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| Thank you. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| Nay. So it passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2955)|

| 0:49:29| and fire departments. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Second. A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2971)|

| 0:49:47| Councilman Dellavalle. Yeah, I was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| ask maybe Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| if he could tell us, there was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| interesting provision in there about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| both cost of remediating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| problems when someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| damages, unfairly cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| a city tree on city property or damages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| its root zone. It looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| like they would have the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| of reparation, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| so you have to restore it. Do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| have that authority? Yeah, there's a state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| that authorizes us at least up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| $250 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| recover those costs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| we actually expend as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| So if we have a tree that costs more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| than $250, we'll have to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| very carefully. So we'll have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| careful about planting trees that cost more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3027)|

| 0:50:31| we do have that authority under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| state statute. That's good to hear, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140429?start=3033)|
