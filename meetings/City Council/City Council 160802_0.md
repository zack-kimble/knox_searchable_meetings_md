| 0:01:44| Okay. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Yes, I'd like to withdraw. I'm sorry, postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| Okay, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| Okay, any items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| You want to withdraw your withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| You went so quickly through, I got you confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| Okay, yes, Mayor. I'd like to postpone items 12A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| For two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| For three weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| I was going to say, are we meeting in three weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| All right, so two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Maybe we need to start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Mr. Furrow has requested this. He was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| I have checked with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Also, what's happened is that he has arranged for a meeting with the neighborhood group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| and so that's going to happen hopefully next week prior to him coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| I also checked with Mr. Green, and we are within the time limit in terms of the amount of time required to have this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=156)|
| 0:02:44| So 12A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Did you have a question, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| I was asking for the explanation but just got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| I was surprised because it had been postponed at least twice before, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| Once before. It was postponed once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| That's what I'm told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| Okay, so did we get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Okay, so any other discussion on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| That's 12A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| Anything else for postponement or to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| We have consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| 11K is the certificate of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| 11L through Q are pensions, and 12D through I are 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| For the mayor's report, first I want to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| and send our best wishes out to the two KPD officers who were in an accident last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| I just wanted to ask Chief Rausch if he would just update us on their progress here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| I actually just spoke with Deputy Chief Monty Houck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| and he's had conversations with family for both officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| They're both home resting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| They both suffered severe concussions and are recovering from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| And then Officer Henderson has some surgery that he'll have to have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| on a fracture to his left orbital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| But other than that, they came out of that relatively unscathed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| So what we had was a shots fired call over in Montgomery Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| The first officer on scene came upon the victim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| and while that officer was checking on the victim, more shots were fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| And, of course, in this environment we're in today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| they did not know if it was an ambush issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| and so the officers were trying to get to that officer on scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| and ended up colliding in the intersection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| The intersection there at Moody and Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| And so we will, of course, investigate that crash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| but at this point that's what we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Thank you, and please let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| We wish them a very speedy recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| So there is an important meeting coming up next Thursday, August 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| at 5.30 p.m. at the John T. O'Connor Senior Citizen Center at 611 Winona Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| This will be a presentation of our Greenway Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| which our Greenways Commission has been working on for the past few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| with consultants, Ross Fowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| The consultants and the Greenways Coordinator, Lori Gerlich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| will present those findings and discuss opportunities for moving ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| with a comprehensive build-out plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| What we're looking to do is to prioritize connections in 13 different corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| to work toward a truly network Greenway transportation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| There will be an opportunity for public comments and questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| and just a really great chance to see all the work that's been done by the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| and with the consultants and city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| So, again, that meeting is next Thursday, August 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| at the O'Connor Senior Center at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| Another meeting to get on your calendars a few weeks out is Thursday, August 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| The O'Connor Engineering Department and their consultants will give an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| on the improvements at Fountain City Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| That meeting will be at 5.30 p.m. in the Lions Club Building in Fountain City Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| again, on Thursday, August 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| As you all know, this has been a very involved process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| First, we had to repair a leak in the lining of the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| and now we are completing work on a new fountain system and pump house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| and the next phase will be the introduction of a new wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| This is all aimed at reducing the algae overgrowth that we have seen in the lake for so many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| and this is part of restoring that historic area as one of the city's public jewels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| So, again, that meeting is 5.30 p.m., August 25th, at the Lions Club Building in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| to learn more about the continued upgrades to Fountain City Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Finally, I want to remind everybody that Knox County Schools starts back next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| It is hard to believe that summer is over in early August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| So remember, next Monday, give yourselves a few extra minutes in your morning commute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| and watch for buses and all those little kiddos running around trying to get to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| I know our KPD officers will also be out in those school zones to remind us all to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| That was a nice way of saying that, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| For the safety of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Councilman Snayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| I just wanted to announce Bike Walk is holding another walk next Tuesday, August 9th, at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| at Jackie's Dream, 2223 McCalla Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| It should be a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| You probably won't need to bring your jacket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| I'm sure it will be warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| You think so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| August 9th, 6 p.m. at Jackie's Dream, 2223 McCalla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| And the Health Department is also promoting this one, teaming up with Bike Walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| So we're hoping to get a good crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Any other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| Okay, let's move on to ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville by amending Article 7, Section 702,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=512)|

| 0:09:24| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| I think I know the answer to this, but I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| On the military aspect, can someone work here like a year or two and then go off for 10 or 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| or is the time limit on the temporary absence such that the credit reflects just a small break in service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| that's counted as actual service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Does anyone know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| I think Christy Pakowski is going to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Christy Pakowski, the executive director for the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| They can be gone as long as they are on approved leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| but once they come back then they have the opportunity to buy that time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| I don't know that there's a set time limit, but usually the police and fire are the people that do that leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=606)|
| 0:10:14| and it has to be approved by the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| I didn't know if you could go off for 15 years and then come back and work a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| I don't think that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| I wasn't anticipating that, but I didn't know if there was an internal rule about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| Let's ask the chiefs maybe to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| It's five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=630)|

| 0:10:39| Oh, five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Just the five-year maximum, and that is pursuant to USERRA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| the federal law that governs the military leave and requires that you provide that service when someone comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=647)|
| 0:10:55| Yes, the paperwork didn't show the limit, and I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| It is five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=658)|

| 0:11:57| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| So that means then we've got four charter amendments that will be on the ballot in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| So start helping us spread the word on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| We'll be doing some communications around that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by John Daniel of the Board of Zoning Appeals decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=733)|

| 0:12:30| located at 570 East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| John Daniel applicant, BZA file number 6-C-16-VA, 5th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=753)|
| 0:12:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Is Mr. Daniel here, John Daniel here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| So according to our rules, you will start and you get up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| You can have up to three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Do you have anybody else here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| So then there will be, we will respond with up to the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| I guess we'll have one person responding up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| Then you have an opportunity for a two-minute rebuttal, should you choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| And then it will be up to council to discuss it and make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| So if you'd like to state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| John Daniel with Design Team Sign Company, address 350 Penhook Drive, Savannah, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| And we will be talking about adding additional signage to the Salseritas location at 570 East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| Their typical signs used at their Salserita locations here in Knoxville are a 42-inch set of channel letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| mounted either on a raceway or direct mount with the Fresh Cantina tagline beneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| The new sign ordinance of last year put a limit on the signage allowed to 10% of the primary frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=832)|
| 0:14:01| and this brought down the allowed square footage to 81 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| This brought down their allowed square footage 45% from what it has typically been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=846)|
| 0:14:14| And they believe that it's going to be a direct impact on customer account as well as profit margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=854)|
| 0:14:23| The International Sign Association has found that signage typically can lead up to 50% of your customer walk-throughs in a given day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=863)|
| 0:14:34| And they also directly link signage to profit, whether it's correctly proportional to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=874)|
| 0:14:44| or in line with their typical marketing line if it's something that they're regularly recognized as having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| That can be a direct correlation as well to their business growth and profit margins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| The location there at 570 East Emory Road sits back from the road a pretty good bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| The visibility coming from either direction is kind of impeded by the locations on either side, the Chick-fil-A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| as well as the new car wash located directly next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| The signage that we're asking for is going to allow for a second side elevation sign in that 42-inch channel letter size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=917)|
| 0:15:26| to go along with a front elevation sign that they are already planning on going forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| We're asking to allow for the increase to allow them to be competitive with other businesses there in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| that have the competitive edge as far as advertising goes with the larger signage currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| And that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| You can sit down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| We'll have the respondent, which is Peter Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=955)|
| 0:16:06| Oh, we also have somebody else to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| Sorry, Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| So let's have Peter speak first, I guess, and then followed by Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections at the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| As was described, the sign ordinance allows, in his situation, a maximum of 81 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| He's proposing two signs on his property, which is not prohibited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| but the square footage needs to maintain the 81 square foot maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| Each of the signs that he's proposing on an individual level meets, but the combination of both of them exceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| And I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| We'll go ahead and hear from everybody maybe, and then do you want to go ahead and ask your question now, Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Can I ask him a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Peter, what about the aspect that other buildings, because of the setback, are obscuring your ability to see this sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1019)|
| 0:17:07| I don't know that that's necessarily the city's problem, but that seems to make it, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| at least arguable that you need something more visible, and there might be a different type of sign, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Could you go ahead and talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| A ground sign, a pole sign, is permitted at that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| and they could have a maximum height of 10 feet and 100 square feet for that pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| That option was provided to the applicant, but that's not in their business model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| so that's not an option that they decided to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| How big is the sign on Broadway that Salsaritas has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| On the side of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| I wonder if the other individual knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Mr. Daniel, do you know this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| It's not the Broadway location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| The last one they put up, though, was at Kingston Pike and Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| They're in front of the, I believe it's Academy Sports, and they used the 42-inch letters at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| Each letter is 42 inches high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| It's based off the height of the tallest letter in the set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| so in this case it would be the S is 42 inches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| and then the rest of the letters are proportional to that with their logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| And how tall would the sign be under the regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| Under the regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Compared to the 42 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| We'd be coming down about 50 percent, so around 30 inches per sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| Around 24 to 30 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Is it just the first letter that triggers your concern, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| That's just the way that when you're talking about a sign like that, the verbiage is based off that first letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1117)|
| 0:18:45| It's just your overall size that we're trying to get increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Vice Mayor Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| The one on Kingston Pike, is there one or two signs on the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| There's two there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| They have one on the front, and then the front face is Academy Sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| Then there's also one on the rear or the side when you're coming from town on Kingston Pike there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| On the back side of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Mr. Daniel, you'll still have an opportunity for a two-minute rebuttal if you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| I'm here tonight representing the Board of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| This matter, it is an appeal of a decision from the City's Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| As a reminder, they hear things a little bit differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| They hear things in a quasi-judicial manner and not in a legislative capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| So tonight, as you're deliberating, it's as a quasi-judicial type of an approach and not a legislative approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| I'm sure your legal counsel can help you if there's any questions about that distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| For a variance to be approved, you have statutes and ordinances that give you standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| and guidance on what has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| For a variance, you're only authorized to grant that when the strict application of specific requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| of the zoning ordinance would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| So that's the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Has the owner been deprived of reasonable use of their land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| They have a commercial business that they've built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| They have ways of putting signs up that are provided to them in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| They absolutely have reasonable use of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| They've got two types of signage available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| They have a ground sign, pole sign out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| They also have wall signage available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| So they have use of that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| There's no physical characteristics of this parcel that result in a practical difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| or an exceptional hardship to placing a detached ground sign out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| They've simply chosen not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| There was a question about elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| When I've been out to that site, the owners have cut the parking lot out one or two feet below ground level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| of road level in front, but that's the owner's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| That's not something that lies with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| That's something they've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| And I believe the sign ordinance also has, when you measure ground site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| it can also be with the level of the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| So there's options available in the sign ordinance for enforcement of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| Yes, the building is set back, but that's not a requirement of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| to set the building back far and instead place primacy on your parking to be in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| So wall signage was something that's critical to the building model that they need seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| and they could have put the building in front and put the parking in the rear of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| We just assert that they've got options that they haven't used in terms of signage for their lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| They have reasonable use from it, and so there's really no standard to grant a variance in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1305)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Mr. Daniel, do you care to have a rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| My only defense as far as it being our choice as far as the building being set back that far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1323)|
| 0:22:11| or anything along those lines and the monument sign or pole sign out front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| with it being a leased space that would fall under their landlord's choices and options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1336)|
| 0:22:25| and that is what he went with, and the franchisee was moving forward with the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1345)|
| 0:22:34| as if he was able to put the same amount of signage and advertising up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| as he had on his other locations in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Now it's time for council to deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| I was just going to make a motion that we deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| A motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Mr. Murphy touched on some of the points I was going to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| but I have reviewed the record as well as standards for variances as found in Article 7, Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| The purpose of the variance is to modify the strict application of specific requirements of the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| of exceptionally irregular, narrow, or shallow, steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| This property and its proposed use do not meet the criteria for granting a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| There are no exceptional conditions or unnecessary hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| which deprive the owner of the reasonable use of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| Therefore, I support the denial of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Any other discussion by Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| We have a motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1434)|

| 0:25:40| Could you fill us in on what you believe to be the cost of the actual construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| I realize part of the work of the engineers will be to make that more certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| but do you have some ballpark that the actual construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| this is $212,000 for the design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| How about building it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1558)|

| 0:26:17| The grant, if I recall correctly, was a million or 1.2 million for the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| So that's the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| 1.2 for design and construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Right, for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| So this is using the first one-sixth or something like that, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1596)|

| 0:26:46| 11E is the resolution authorizing the mayor to amend contract number C-16-0012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| with Renaissance Inc. for the Lakeshore Park site demolition project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| increasing the contract amount by $33,225.32| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| for a total contract amount of $538,340.15 and extending the date of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1621)|

| 0:27:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Maybe Chris can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| What number or change in the budget for this is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| We used to get, like, in the agenda, this is change order number one or two or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| and I'm just curious, you know, how many times has this increased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| Jim's probably better at answering that than I am, but we increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| We increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| We had a change order where we demolished part of the general services building out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| the old kitchen that was of no use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| and then we know we're going to have a change order where we're going to be taking down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| one of the cottages out there that Helen Ross McNabb could not convert for use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| and the state no longer wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| So that would probably be the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| This is probably the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| This is the third one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| So then you'll have this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| And the next one that I'm talking about in regards to the Greenbrier Cottage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| that one will be the fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| and probably be bringing that within the next couple of council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Is that something new that we've taken out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Can we have that put back in the agenda when that's written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| Page 167 has some of that information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1711)|

| 0:28:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1720)|

| 0:29:09| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| and deliver a license agreement with Externet Systems, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| for the purpose of constructing, maintaining, operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| and using a fiber-optic telecommunications network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| within the City of Knoxville's public rights-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| subject to certain terms, conditions, and limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1764)|

| 0:29:29| Councilman Delamonte?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| I know that they just kind of want to ride their way through Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Are they going to stop and deliver some of this high-speed service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| through the fiber-optics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| or is it just the rite of passage they're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| Trustee Branscom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Yeah, so Janet Wright was the one that was in charge of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| but I know, Charles, you worked with her on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| so maybe you can answer that question better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| I actually run in my office and negotiated that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| but the answer to your question is I don't really know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| whether they're going to leave some of the high-speed data here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| More than likely so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| but that's through a private contract with whoever receives that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| Yeah, it looks like it passes through Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| based on the little map they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Depends on whether they have customers or not, I suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| And we do get paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| Yeah, the $638 or whatever it is is not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| $53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1825)|

| 0:32:49| Most prevalent is trying to pick a species that's going to meet the site of where it's going to be planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1969)|
| 0:32:57| That specific tree that you were talking about, a hornbeam, is pure middle in shape, upright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| and fits in really tight quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| What about the space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Like when you plant along public ways, you have different demands for root systems and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| I've seen some trees that were planted years ago that look like they're hurting because they're in a tight spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| Yeah, same thing with the root system as we do with the crown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Try and get species that aren't going to be as aggressive in areas where their root systems are going to be restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| So right tree for right place is the motto here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Yeah, that's the idea behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| We've been doing that for about four years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| and trying to diversify as much as possible to try and restrict ourselves from catastrophes such as emerald ash borer or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2016)|
| 0:33:47| You had one called a Chinese pistache or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| A Chinese pistache tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| It's a very hardy tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| It's medium in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| It looks a lot like a golden rain tree without all the fruits and droppings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| It doesn't have the pods and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Thank you, Casey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Thank you for the work you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| You did a great job for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Okay, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| I'm trying to turn it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Okay, so that is the end of our agenda except for public forum and Mr. Presley signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2049)|
| 0:34:18| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Is Mr. Presley here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| He is not here, so there is no further business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| So we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160802?start=2064)|
