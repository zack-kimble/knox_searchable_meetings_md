| 0:01:38| The Planning Commissions are citizens from the city and county who have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| appointed by either the city mayor or county mayor. We receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| no salary and volunteer our time as a service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| Applicants and citizens who registered to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| in this meeting were sent invitations to join us as online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| attendees. As an attendee, you can follow the meeting on Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| but you will not be able to speak until you have been recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| by me and planning staff enables you to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| As a Zoom attendee, you must raise your hand to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| Place your cursor on the bottom of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| device's Zoom screen to display the menu bar. Click on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| attendees or participants menu item. A list will display| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| typically on the right side. At the bottom of the list is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| raise your hand tab. When you wish to speak, click this tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| You will be recognized. Planning staff will unmute your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| I will call on you and you will be able to speak. Please be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| certain that your microphone is turned on so that we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| There will likely be two points at which you would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| The first, which comes near the beginning of the meeting, is when I read the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| postponement and consent lists. If you are the applicant in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| to have an item postponed, I will read the postponement list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| I will ask if there are any items to be added to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| You must raise your hand as explained a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| You will then be recognized and asked to speak. Please remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| to state your name and address. Immediately following postponements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| the same process will be used to hear requests to remove items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| from the consent list. The other time you may wish to speak is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| when the agenda item in which you have an interest is discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| Please take note. When the item is announced, I will read the item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| description. Then I may ask for comments from planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| Following any staff comments, I will ask if the applicant is present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| if there is any opposition. At this time, please raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| your hand. Planning staff will enable you to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| using your computer or other device. I will call on the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| first, then the opposition. The applicant will introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| him or herself, then the opposition will introduce him or herself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| each providing name and address. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| ask the applicant if she wishes to speak first or wishes the opposition to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| The selected speakers will then have up to five minutes per side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| applicant and opposition to present their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| The planning commission may grant additional time for presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| of information. Speakers should limit their remarks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| the facts of the case and should avoid repeating comments that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| previously presented to the commission. Because of the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| items we have before us, groups in favor or opposed to an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| have been asked to appoint a spokesperson to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| If you have any items that you would like to make a part of the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=282)|

| 0:10:06| approval of the... Hey Pat, hold on one second. I've got a question. We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| a hand up. Go ahead. Steve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| if we recuse from one item on consent, we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| need to vote on the rest of the consent agenda. Is that correct or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| That's wrong. You abstain from the entire consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Okay. Can I ask a question as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| I needed to add something to the post-element list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=630)|
| 0:10:38| Continue. That will need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| voted on by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| Steve, can he add that now before we get into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| consent list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Well, you have to back up. And since you've already commenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| the consent list, it would probably be more appropriate to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| the matter up at its regular place in the agenda and just make the request for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| David, you're the applicant for this file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| And I had my hand up, but I didn't get recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| at the time by the chair. So I sent in a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| to ask for the post-element. I got a lot of people from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| neighborhood wanting me to postpone this. I see. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| Mr. Phillips, it's up to you. If you want to back up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| do a post-element, that would be fine. You're in control of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| however you want to handle it. If you want to step back and do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| request for post-element. Yeah, Mr. Wise, I think I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=704)|

| 0:12:44| documents together for the application. So I'm requesting a 60-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| post-element. Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=768)|

| 0:12:56| requests for post-element by the applicants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Hearing none, do you want to vote on these all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| or do you want to vote on them separately? You do need to do it separately. You've got a 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| request for Mr. Harbin and a 60-day request for Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=788)|

| 0:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| My name is Melissa Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| I live at 8730 Brookhaven Drive, Knoxville, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| That's in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| We have lived here for the last dozen years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| I've attempted with my background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| and I don't know how well it's translated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| to illustrate where our home is relative to the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| that's being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| The circle at the top is where there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| been previous flooding and the property immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| across of West Emory from the proposed ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| home subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| And then the water passes through a culvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| under West Emory there, along West Emory South,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| and under Carnes Valley, where then it proceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| through the back of our Brookhaven neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Unfortunately, the image is cut off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| but immediately below where the line is cut off on the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| is where my house is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| And then with this next image, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| going to try and show you what our backyard looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| like the spring of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Obviously, there was quite a bit of flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| throughout Knoxville, but this was February 24, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| where usually there's only a dry creek bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| with very occasional water from that runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Instead, more than half of our backyard was flooded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| and this was down a foot from where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| it had been the previous day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| We are just a few, um, uh, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1934)|

| 0:32:19| that's being presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Yeah, can you see my back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1943)|

| 0:32:27| Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Um, I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| I can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1956)|

| 0:32:46| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| I thought she may have been showing something behind her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Go ahead, Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| I had also emailed these pictures to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| that have two of our backyard and then one with the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| illustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1979)|
| 0:33:09| I'm sure we've received those, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| Ms. Frazier, are you still with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=1994)|

| 0:33:25| Ms. Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| Seem to lost Ms. Frazier's connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2011)|
| 0:33:47| All right, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| I'm not sure what we can proceed any further with her comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| We seem to have lost her in some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| Commissioners, do you have any comments you'd like to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2039)|

| 0:34:57| So perhaps now is not the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| Should we ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| We could finish with the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| If there were more and then we could ask questions of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| Commissioner, there's actually three people who've been signed, who's signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| Yeah, Mr. Hatton and Ms. McBee, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| And are they, they did not respond earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| Let's see if we can get Mr. Hatton unmuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| Both of them are unmuted now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2129)|

| 0:35:52| Apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| 7511 Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| And I just wanted to speak for a few minutes about the community and some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| that we're having, which would also involve this specific neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| We talked about the density of five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| We realize that this is a pretty good-sized parcel of land, but considering the area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| this neighborhood is going to be in, we feel that that density is way too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| It's not consistent with the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| Those homes that are located on West Emory and also a neighborhood, Emory Fields, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| homes are at least a half an acre to an acre lot, if not more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| They have problems with sewage already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| They have problems with flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| They have problems with traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| In looking at the map of this particular parcel, Emory Road is a state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| And given that, there are issues concerning the drop-offs on those roads and around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2219)|
| 0:36:59| This land will sit very close to a blind curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| I contacted or tried to contact Mr. Hickey the other day via email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| I didn't hear anything back from him, but I just wanted to know what the interest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| the exit was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| I know that's going to be part of the concept plan once, you know, if it does get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| The other thing is, I just mentioned about the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| This traffic out of this neighborhood is not only going to go to north on Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| and go out onto Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| This traffic is going to come back from Carnes Valley Road and proceed down to Beaver Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| and go through a horrible intersection once, much like the Carpenter Herald Road intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| And that traffic already backs up all the way to the ball fields that have been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| right off of Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| I know there's a Carnes Connector that was an $8 million deal with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| But having said that, it did shunt the traffic from Oak Ridge Highway at the red light there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| in Carnes, the original red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| But it's also shunted a lot of traffic to a road that just cannot handle any more traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| The other thing, and I just, I know I'm running out of time and I'm trying to talk really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| really fast and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| I've got a lot of stuff written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| We have flooding issues in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| There was already an approval for a five-unit acre right down the road on Emory as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| That was also in a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| We have multiple issues with flooding already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| And some of that is due to the continued development that goes on in and around Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| That is the main tributary that drops off into the Quent River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| And we have an enormous amount of issues that are regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| And let's see, just if you don't mind, just in closing, I'd like to just make a few points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| The Carnes community is wanting safe, smart infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| We desperately need infrastructure improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| And so anyway, that's one of the things that we are really, really wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Development is not the same as progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| We need to progress to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| We also need development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| I don't know that anybody is truly against development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| but we have to put things in place for safety for our residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| safety for people that don't even live in Carnes that are using our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| There's two ways in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| There's Emory Road and there's Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2372)|
| 0:39:32| And other than that, you're landlocked on those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| There's no other way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Thank you, Ms. McBee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Your time is up, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2383)|
| 0:39:43| I appreciate the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Commissioner Roth, I notice your hand's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| I'd like to make a motion to approve plan residential zone M-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| because it's consistent with the sector plan designation of LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| and HP Hillside Protection for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| I want to recognize Commissioner Korbelich| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Commissioner Korbelich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| I'm not ready to entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| I think that we need to have discussion first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| and then we can proceed with the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| and then have some discussion on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| And I had a number of questions for Mr. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| He's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2436)|
| 0:40:36| For Mr. Hickey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Mr. Hickey, I don't live in the Carnes area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| but I do understand that the PR zone requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| that you are requesting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| because there's an environmental constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| And I'd like to know what you identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| as the environmental constraint that you're asking for PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| and how you might propose to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| And I know it's a little early for your flat design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| but I think given that you have environmental constraint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| you will probably be looking at how to accommodate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| with a special design or with open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| So I'm asking you, Mr. Hickey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| for some additional information on your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| Yes, you have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| We'll do a stream determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| but what we believe right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| is there's a blue line stream on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| as you can see on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| So that's a significant environmental constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| There's also a TVA power transmission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| access easement across this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| They have the power line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| So that is another constraint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| we're going to have to deal with as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| But I think it's important to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| the planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| which we've asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| requires us to bring a concept plan back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| for you all to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| and for the public to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Yes, yes, you're quite right, Mr. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| I have one more question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| and that would be to the county engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| Who is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Is he available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| Ms. Brooks is a county engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| That would be Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| That would be Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Mr. Snowden, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Mr. Snowden, we are familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| with the concerns the residents have in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| about infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| particularly flooding and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| I know this is not the time or place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| We have a huge agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| but I do want you to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| in 25 words or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| tell me if the county is actually looking at a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| to ascertain what these issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| and how to go about improving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| This is Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Yes, Commissioner, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| We actually replaced the culvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| that's in question under Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| It was a 36-inch metal culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| We replaced that with a 36-inch smooth wall plastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| that should provide for more flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| The existing pipe was very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| it was damaged and not really conveying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| the amount of water it should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| So we have replaced that recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| due to routine maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| We are looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| matter of fact, spoke with Jeff Welch this morning at TPO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| to work on getting an improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| at West Emory at Byington or Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| We have a proposal for a signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| and turn lanes at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| So from a perspective of drainage and infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| we are looking at several things in the vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| to eliminate or at least improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| upon some of the concerns of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Thank you very much, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2644)|

| 0:44:12| I noticed Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| did you have your hand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| No other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| to approve PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| up to five dwellings per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| because it is consistent with the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| of LDR low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2675)|

| 0:45:51| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| The next item is agenda item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| It requires one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| The applicant is Leticia Hernandez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| Location, north side of Bablay Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| south of Edmondson Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| west of Harris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Approximate size of tract, 9.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| Present zoning is CB Business and Manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| Zoning requested, A, Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Existing land use is single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| Staff recommendation, approve A, Agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| because it is consistent with the Northeast County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| Sector Plan's low-density residential designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| and with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| and because it brings the zoning into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| with the Sector Plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| Ms. Hernandez, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| Commissioner, we had one individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| signed up as opposition, Ms. Carolyn Cummins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| I don't see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| I don't see her name in the attendees list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| I emailed her a little bit earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| She was going to be calling on behalf of her mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| And so she was in Texas, wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| she knew that we were in a different time zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| So I'm not sure if that's what the issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| or if she just changed her mind about wanting to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| but she's not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2847)|
| 0:47:27| Is Ms. Hernandez available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| Yes, she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Would you have five minutes to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| Actually, this is her first time doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| She just wants to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| because she is demolishing her house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| and she's going to rebuild it from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| So it's apparently from business and manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| to an agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| So she doesn't know how to work this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| and neither do I, because I'm just her translator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| Can you give us the applicant's name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| Her name is Ms. Leticia Hernandez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Her address is 6129 Bayblade Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Is there anything you would like to add to the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| Is agriculture the same thing as residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2906)|
| 0:48:34| Residential is permitted in agriculture, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| Yeah, that's all she wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| And if there's any other paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| that she needs to turn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| just to go ahead and start with her project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| Or with the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| then if you could let us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| so we can send you any paperwork needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| Ms. Brooks, do you or Michelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| would you like to address Ms. Hernandez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| There's no additional, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| There's no additional paperwork needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| So once it goes from the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| it will go to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| next month for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| And once that is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| then they would be able to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| for building permits to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Now the county will require paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Not exactly sure what that will entail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| but they would be able to help you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| through that process at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| Okay, and what I heard at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| there was somebody that opposed to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| What happens if that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| does actually go ahead and contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| and still opposed to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Once the vote's taken today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=2980)|

| 0:55:41| was in a floodplain and that future construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| would not be a concern for us for that very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| So, backfilling and construction issues have been a deterrent to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| So, we bought here and it was reasonable for us to expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| to continue to enjoy this beautiful peaceful scenery in the wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| Be that as it may, to have two housing developments on top of each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| would sadly diminish the aesthetic appeal of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| And those of us that are already here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| bought for the quiet country atmosphere in our beautiful setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| Cut down the trees and grow more houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| and it would quickly contribute to the loss of rural character in the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| And growth in the area has already dictated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| that second truck stop on Straw Plains Pike across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| So, traffic has increased, not to mention the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| But there are pockets of picturesque scenery here along Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| We ask that you please don't compromise it so close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| to those of us that are already here enjoying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| We are petitioning at the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| please be denied to help preserve the natural beauty of our little community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| Thank you, Mrs. Rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| Mr. LeBlanc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| Yes, this is Destin LeBlanc, 1609 Mysterio View Way, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| I'm not speaking in opposition, I'm just wanting more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| One thing I have, I realize that we will get a development plan if this is approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| and that we may have more comments then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| But my first question is, in the staff impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| they had estimated traffic impact of 911 average daily trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| I'm trying to figure out how they're estimating 911 daily trips out of eight acres with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3442)|
| 0:57:30| you know, the Mysterio Plantation condominium is a larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| we have 60 units and there's no way that we're even close to several hundred daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| So, I'm wondering how they get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| how they get the estimated daily student impact of nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| when they have no idea how many units are even going to be put on this unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| on this property or how many are proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| The other thing, I realize that it's, it is in a FEMA flood zone X,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3473)|
| 0:58:01| which is, but the staff report says there's a significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| there's not a significant steep slope, but there is a creek on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| And we have observed that sometimes the creek is dry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| but when it rains and it's sometimes that creek water gets up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| into the back portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| So, that's at least something that the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| as well as the builder or the applicant should consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| when they're trying to design how many units they can put on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| So, with that, I'll yield time to whoever else wants to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| but I'm not opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| I just want information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Well, thank you, Mr. LeBlanc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| Liz Albertson is the staff person on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| Liz, would you go over the traffic impact of the units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| and also the education numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| Yes, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| This is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| I'm a senior planner with Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| And if we're looking at the staff report on page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| or 9-2, where it says estimated traffic impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| there's a bit of a description about how this number is generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| And we estimate that based on the maximum amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| that could be accommodated under the requested zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| So, basically, that would be, you know, highest build out possible scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3569)|
| 0:59:37| So, the average daily vehicle trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| they're computed using the national average trip rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| And this is under the latest edition of the trip generation manual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| by the Institute of Transportation Engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| We also have a transportation engineer on our staff on this call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| that could elaborate more if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| But the average daily trips represents a total number of trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| that that particular land use could be expected to generate during a 24-hour day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3601)|
| 1:00:08| So, that is based on what would be estimated build out for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| So, if you take the acreage and multiply it by 12 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| you get around 84 dwelling units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| So, that would typically generate 911 average daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| But however, as the opposition noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| they may not necessarily, you know, build out at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| This would be a maximum generation possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you, Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| Mr. Eddy, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| The applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| Yes, am I live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| I appreciate your time and I appreciate the work the staff's put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| I'll just go through a few notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| My father and I, we co-own the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Oh, I guess first off, my name is Curtis Eddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| I'm here with my father, who is Douglas Eddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| And I'm the current resident at 6721 Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| So, I live in the home there on the property right now with my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| So, just to go through, I guess, a few points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| We purchased the property looking at the future potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| You know, we did our research and looked at what the sector plan would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| You know, we knew this, if you look at Strawberry Plains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| we're off of a major arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| We're about a mile from being on I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| headed to either to Spearville or towards Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| Let me see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Sorry, let me go through my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| We've got just down the street from us, there's commercial going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| We also have what appears to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| and I tried to research it as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| but there's actually a distribution center going in down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| I believe on that section that shows IG, if I've got the part right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| So, there's going to be, there's a lot of jobs coming to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| And there's really a lot of developers are not building in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| There's a lack of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I'm in real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| I'm a local realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| My father is a home builder, licensed home builder here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| You know, we just don't see any affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| or new products going in on this east side of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| We just had a medical manufacturing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| put down off of, just off John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| bringing in a ton of jobs for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| It's really kind of revitalizing the seaside of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| And, you know, I live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| The property will not be fully developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| even though we don't have our plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| The amount of units seem to be a concern by somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| but we're not going to tear that house down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| The home that I live in is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| it's a brick home, 4,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| And, you know, I plan on remaining in that property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| It's just the rest of the acreage we'd like to be able to utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| and comply with what the sector plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| Let's see, I had a couple other notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Oh, I understand Ms. Rush's complaint about the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| I mean, it's a beautiful view from their porch into our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| And, you know, I understand that everybody hates it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| when somebody builds next door to them and doesn't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| But at the same time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| for us to be able to utilize the property for what we bought it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| and comply with what the sector plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| And if you look at the zoning that we're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| it's the same zoning that she's living in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| So, you know, we're not coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| and bringing something that's different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| to deteriorate the neighborhood in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| Once we have a plan together, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| we'll bring in quality product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| that I think will be an asset to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Do you have anything you want to add to that, Dad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| If there's any other questions from neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| we're happy to try to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| One of the items that was brought up, this is Douglas Eddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| I'm at 4326 Mannington Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| One of the concerns seems to be with the creek going through the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| Any development that we propose or plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| of course, will be addressed by a licensed civil engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| and any draining issues will be addressed and handled at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| So we certainly wouldn't do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| that's not in compliance with good engineering practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| I think that's about all we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| If you guys have any questions for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| though, we're happy to add to it and appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| Thank you, Mr. Eddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| Mr. Scott Smith, you had your hand up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| Yeah, I was just listening to Mrs. Rush's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| and, you know, it kind of occurs to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| that Mrs. Rush lives in a condo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| just a matter of feet from this guy's property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| And so the Eddies have to look at the condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| but nobody in the condos wants to have to look at more condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| and it just seems like it's not really fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| The adjacent condos are 12 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| and that seems extremely consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| with what this guy should be able to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| The creek is not, I don't see a flood zone on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| I've checked KGIS maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| So I'm going to make a motion just to move things along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| that we approve PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| up to 12 units an acre because it's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| with the East County Sector Plan, NBRO designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| and with the adjacent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| Wait a minute, Ms. Korbelick had her hand up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| Ms. Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3934)|
| 1:05:34| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| I'm not, I had a couple of questions for the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| before we start to entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Mr. Eddy Jr., I suppose, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| I am, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Yeah, it seems to me that the PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| is entirely appropriate given you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| in the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| But my question to you, sir, is from the aerial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| the back portion of that property is marshy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| And I see you have two ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| I don't know if they're spring fed or if it's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| But so my question to you is given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| that you are going to have a little challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| in developing the property given the marsh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| and those two ponds, I don't know how long the ponds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| I don't know if they come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| But do you feel that you really need 12 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| I mean, I'm just being realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| because you're going around some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| of these environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Are you sure you want the 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Are you going to be able to do 12 or even up to 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| Am I live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| Can I speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Yes, go ahead, Mr. Eddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4012)|
| 1:06:52| So the aerial view that they have up right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| shows two blue sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Those are not ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| The one is my home and the other is my shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Because I didn't, I remember seeing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| when I looked at the aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| What about the marsh, Mr. Eddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| So I'm not sure what you're referring to as marsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| There is one, there's a stream that runs right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| along the back blue line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| And I've been back there when it's flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| There's one little section by the trees that gets wet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| But when we spoke with our engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| he said we need to develop an area anyways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| to collect runoff from anything that we developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| That's a county requirement usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| And he said that that area would be sufficient for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| But if you look at the back corner along the condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| you're up on a little bit of a hill there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| And I guess you can't see slope on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| And then you see my shop behind my house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| This is all high and dry land from the road back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| except right along the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| There's a little bit of wet spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| but it drops down into the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| And I've never, I've been out there when it's pouring rain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| and I've never seen that creek come out of its bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| It doesn't show a floodplain on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| I've seen it pouring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| And we realize we may have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| a little bit of excavation work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| to make sure that everything flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| And our engineer will handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| But yeah, there's no ponds and no flood zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| or marsh that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| You've answered my question very completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| And when we're finished with discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| I would like to second Mr. Scott Smith's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| So we got a motion by Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| seconded by Mr. Horvilick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| to approve PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4112)|

| 1:08:37| because it is consistent with the East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4117)|

| 1:09:36| Next item is agenda item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| This is a plan amendment and rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Requires two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| The applicant is Boys and Girls Club of Greater Knoxville, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| Location, west side of Dry Gap Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| south of East Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Tract is 5.81 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| Present plan designation zoning is C1 Civic Institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| and PR Planned Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Proposed plan designation zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| G.C. General Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| P.C. Planned Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| Existing land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4212)|
| 1:10:12| quasi-public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| deny the plan amendment to G.C. General Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| because an expansion of G.C. at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| could have adverse impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| due to the potential for more intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| retail and service-oriented service uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| Second motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4232)|
| 1:10:32| deny P.C. Planned Commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| because it is not consistent with the North County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| and can cause adverse impacts for neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4248)|
| 1:10:48| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| This is Robert Campbell representing Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| I'm on their North Knoxville Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4255)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| Mr. Campbell, you're free to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4264)|
| 1:11:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| This process has started two or three years ago with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| We were looking for an electronic messaging board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| to help better educate not just the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| but the kids and families that use the club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| Some intermittently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| to make sure that we get better information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| And the Boys and Girls Club, as many of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| have done tremendous work during this COVID time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| and that boards needed even more to give out information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| As we were looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| we were kind of surprised that we were zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| Planned Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| and especially in light of the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| almost the entire corridor is commercial or institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| There's a KUB substation next to us to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| To the north, there's a small piece of commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| that's for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Then there's a large indoor storage warehouse, restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| There's a school across the street from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| Hossdale Pell's got a sewer storage station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| So it's a four-lane divided road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| that lends itself very well to commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| all the way up and down the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| And on the other end, which is not very far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| multiple commercial developments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| So we had a discussion with Knox County Codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| as well as NPC staff to see what our options were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| During that meeting, we came down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| some sort of commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| and it was recommended that we go with a plain commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| for the very reason that plain commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| if there was any possible change to the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| would require that whoever did that change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| would have to come back to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| to ratify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| The Boys and Girls Club wants to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| that they keep providing good service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| They also wanna be good members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| and wanna make sure that they continue the mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| that they've done so well over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| This seemed like a good option for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| We don't anticipate this facility being anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| but a Boys and Girls Club for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| As most of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| there's the facilities they've had downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| and in other locations have been Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| for multiple years, 40, 50 years or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| And so they're committed to the services they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| We do need an electronic messaging board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| We do need to get this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| we think back up to the level of the other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| that are going on around the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| And we disagree with kind of what staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| Remember the sector plan was done in 2012, I believe, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| I think we've got 12, 15,000 cars per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| that go on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| This road is a major connector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| between Emory Road, Cunningham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| and eventually not very far away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| Calhoun Interchange on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| So if you go out and look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| you would believe that this is a correct designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| for commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| And we just ask that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| we appreciate what the staff's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| but we just believe they've interpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| this situation incorrectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| and we ought to be allowed to go with plain commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| And I've got Bart McFadden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| who's the executive director on the YN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| if you need to ask him any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| I forgot to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4486)|
| 1:14:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| Thank you, Mr. McFadden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Yes, I hope I'm live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Go ahead, Mr. McFadden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| You've got a minute and 21 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| My name, Bart McFadden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| address 967 Irwin Street, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| I would just echo what Robert said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| You know, we have no plans to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| other than the essential work that we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| to hundreds and hundreds of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| there in that Halls community at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| You know, that facility, that land was gifted to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| 20 plus years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| And we want to continue to serve those families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| but also be able to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| you know, just better citizens of that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| and better educating our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| and the ones who need our services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| so that they know what's going on within our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| So that's purely the motivation behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| for our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| Thank you, Mr. McFadden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| Mr. Commissioner, I notice your hand's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| Yeah, you know, I struggled a little bit with this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| early on when I looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| But, you know, I very rarely disagree with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| They're usually pretty dead on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| In this particular case, you know, there's a choke point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| There's a natural choke point of any type of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| I guess, going to the southeast below the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| where the floodway is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| So nobody's going to be developing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| on that side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| It is a four-lane divided highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| As you can see on this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| most everything contiguous to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| other than floodway is zone commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| I think the applicant going for a planned commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| which requires a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| to go back to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| if anything else happens down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| I think that's a good safety net for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| I think it's an appropriate request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| And I know it's early in discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| so I won't jump out and make a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| But I will be making a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| or if somebody hasn't, to approve this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| But Commissioner Ooten, you can go ahead and make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| We'll still recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Yeah, I'll go ahead and make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| that we approve the G.C. request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| Eddie Smith, I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| I'll just second, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| Commissioner Gregg Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| Thank you, Chairman Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| I have to second everything that Commissioner Ooten had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| I'm a product of the Boys Club back in the early 50s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| when I first came to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| And we made a huge concession for Duluth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| here a few months ago over a sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| and that's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| I think there is already an electronic sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| across the street from the Boys Club that's a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| And given the fact that that is a commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| I can fully support the motion made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| Thank you, Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4676)|
| 1:18:06| Mr. Roth, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| I was going to make a motion to second it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| but I'm OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| OK, Commissioner Corbelett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| Yes, I agree that the Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| does a wonderful civic service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| but I think that we're looking through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| but in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| If the sector plan is old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| I think what we need to do is update the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| I think creating rezones for the sole purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| of having a digital sign opens a Pandora's box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| And I love the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| I'm a member of the YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| I get a lot of information through other social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| that they use and also just going into the lobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| where they have their programs and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| announced on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| They don't need a digital sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| and they have an extensive program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| including afterschool care for the COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| And I just don't see that the Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| is a different category than any other organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| that provides community involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| and programs to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| I think it's really a bad thing to change a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| simply because we think that the Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| should have a digital sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| I think we're just opening the Pandora's box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| for any other use that can be allowed in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| We haven't been really examined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| what all those other uses might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| So if the motion to approve fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| I will be making a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| Thank you, Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| Yeah, I just really good comments, Sandra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| I agree with you and I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| I would not be voting for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| strictly to get somebody assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| The more I've looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| I mean, it is commercial all the way back to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| It is a four lane divided road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| There has been a brand new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| within the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| sewer improvements on the other side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| KUV owns a substation immediately south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| It's bounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4839)|
| 1:20:39| If you'll put the map up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| showing the floodway around this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| it is not gonna cause the migration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| of commercial property anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| It's bounded by floodway on all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| I think that this use of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| is more appropriate in a planned commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| than it is in a planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| So I'm gonna support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| I think the sector plan changes is justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| The zoning is justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| And the fact that it is planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| means we do get to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| We are not exposed to just anything going in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| in the unlikely event they go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| So I will support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| When I looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| I was really surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| that there could be any opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| I thought it looked like it was probably already commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| because everything around it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| And I don't see any reason not to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4903)|
| 1:21:52| It's just in a good location that I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4912)|
| 1:21:59| regardless of whether it's a boys club or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| if someone was just wanting to come in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| and put a store in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| I think it's a good place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| So I'm very much in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4932)|
| 1:22:12| Thank you, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| I'm not familiar with the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| that Commissioner Uten mentioned about the Duluth sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| But I guess that's the part of this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| that I'm really thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| since the applicant has made clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| that their real intention is to have this digital sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| And I would echo what Commissioner Korbelik raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| and have seen other issues in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| where signage becomes a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| The digital signage and that shouting for attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| so it has nothing to do with the boys club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| the Boys and Girls Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| obviously a great organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| But the efforts of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| to try and minimize that visual clutter that's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| scenic Knoxville echoed that in their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| So I just want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| I'm absolutely for the Boys and Girls Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| but don't think that a digital sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| it being there or not being there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| will really make an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| on the great services that they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| Thank you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| It seems to be frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| But yes, I agree with Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| I don't think that the sector plan has this CI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| I don't think the desire to have an electronic sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| is reason for a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| I really don't see that that's enough of a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| for us to approve a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| I agree with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5035)|
| 1:23:55| And I'll agree with Commissioner Corbelic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| in the fact that I think that a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| in the county need to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| And when you look at the Boyd Center study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| that over the next 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| another 85,000 people are expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| to move into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| I think we need to be looking at an updated plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| for everything for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| so that we can make better decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| However, on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| just a few yards down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| is an electronic sign for the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| where they are putting out information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| for parents and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| to help them understand what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| The Boys and Girls Club would do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| It would not be a nuisance in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| since there already is a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| And I know the people involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| with the Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| and they will be tactful and cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| about how they do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| how they build it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5079)|
| 1:24:39| and how they use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| So with that, I would support the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| to override staff on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| just so that we can allow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| to continue to help get the word out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| about services that they can offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| did you second that motion as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5097)|
| 1:24:57| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| I just want to make a point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| when we were looking at plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| and rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| we don't need to look at particular uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| or requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| We need to look at the overall area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| and if there's any changes that have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| in that vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| and shouldn't focus on signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| or particular use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| Yeah, I would like to point that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| that when I made the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| I didn't say one word about the Boys Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| or Girls Club or signs or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| I specifically stuck to the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| and the changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| So we have a motion by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| seconded by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| to approve the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| to allow the expansion of GC at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| Is that correct, Mr. Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| Yes, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| We just need to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| I think Commissioner Uten said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| that the rationale was for changing conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| but just that that's clear in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| Yes, I did say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5165)|

| 1:28:09| The next item is agenda item number 11, rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| This requires one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| The applicant is Fulton Properties, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| Location, east side of number two drive across from number four drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| Size of tract, 20.20.21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| Present zoning is I industrial and A agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Zoning requested PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| Existing land use, agriculture, forestry, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| Density proposed, one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| Staff recommendation, approved PR planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| with up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| for the requested portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| Because it is consistent with the northeast county sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Low density residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| Because it brings the zoning into compliance with the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| Staff recommends also rezoning the sliver of industrial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| that remains on the western portion of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5353)|

| 1:29:26| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| Ms. Porche is the staff person with this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| This was discussed at Tuesday's agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| Are there any questions for Ms. Porche from commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5385)|
| 1:29:52| Seeing none, I entertain a motion to approve PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5392)|
| 1:30:00| Mr. Phillips, I'd like to make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| PR plan residential zoning with five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| for the requested portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Because it's consistent with the northeast county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| Low density residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| And because it brings the zoning into compliance with the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| Ms. Adams, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5424)|
| 1:30:33| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| I tried to raise my hand a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| I had a question for the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| Because we did receive some opposition emails about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| And it was talking about flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| And I just wondered if there was any comment from engineering on flooding issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5449)|
| 1:31:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5461)|
| 1:31:01| This is Jim Snowden again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| Yeah, we've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| There is, I think, the complaint or the concern that we received was a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| Some of the area may drain too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| Obviously, we don't know if that's exactly where they're going to drain their water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| Obviously, it does potentially also go to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| But our sinkhole ordinance does require that you do not release the flood elevation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| So if they do choose to drain any water towards that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| the high water elevation would be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| So that nobody will actually receive more water than what they did previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5498)|

| 1:33:51| or the surrounding development and could cause adverse impacts to neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| Yes, Steve Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Ms. Hart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| We had one indicated she wanted to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| So there's no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| Mr. Maddox, would you like to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Give us your name and address please for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| Yes, Steve Maddox, 100 Dalton Place Way, Knoxville 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| This is a property that we've owned for like 14 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5670)|
| 1:34:36| and have been working on a plan for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| during that, for that entire time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| And it has been determined by us and a study that I previously sent out to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5684)|
| 1:34:56| planning commission based on this study by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| that Knoxville is in need of a sports complex to be able to compete with the surrounding areas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5700)|
| 1:35:08| Charlotte, Atlanta, Nashville, and to some extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| Sevierville and other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| And then also in that study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| it pointed out that this location was the number one location in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5718)|
| 1:35:24| for that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| And this is the entrance into the western end of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| right there at the split, the junction of I-40 and I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| It's also on an interchange that has previously been known as the Truck Stop Interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5739)|
| 1:35:48| That is changing to some extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| because there's new truck stops that have been developed on down 40 and on down further down 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5751)|
| 1:35:58| And the trucks do not like to be in an area where there's a lot of automobile traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| So they're already thinning out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| And one reason for that is that a lot of traffic comes off of this exit and goes into Farabit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5765)|
| 1:36:14| This is the other main entrance into Farabit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| And then also, and I think this is of major importance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| this is the other, this is the entrance into the other end of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| That's the fastest growing area in Knox County, as we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| And this is the other entrance into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| And this development will be a boost for everything around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| And also, that study shows the economic impact to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5801)|
| 1:36:49| to Knox City, into Loudoun County, into Farabit, the Turkey Creek shopping areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5809)|
| 1:36:57| all the hotels that are there now and ones that would be developed because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5817)|
| 1:37:04| So this is nothing but a very good thing for all of this surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5824)|
| 1:37:17| The staff recommends denial because, for the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| because there's nothing else been done in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| Well, first off, I think it's like office zoning and those kinds of things are never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5846)|
| 1:37:36| going to be developed there with the rock quarry and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| And my question would be, what comes first, the chicken or the egg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| We need to settle this development to bring in that into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| Thank you, Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5875)|
| 1:38:04| Commissioner Browning, is your mic off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| Unmute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| Okay, can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| We can hear you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5893)|
| 1:38:13| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| And full disclosure to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| My family had ownership in this piece of property 13 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5899)|
| 1:38:26| We have no financial interest in it now at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| The reason I'm saying that is I am very familiar with this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| In fact, I have done a lot of work on this property 10, 11 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5918)|
| 1:38:45| trying to figure out what to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| It appears that what Steve Maddox is proposing is an excellent use for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5929)|
| 1:39:00| I mean, considering it's been sitting there for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| This project, if approved and if it can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| it's going to produce all kinds of jobs and tax revenue for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| It'll also bring in these kinds of sports complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| They tend to bring in a lot of transient people that's not going to have to be supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5962)|
| 1:39:29| by the local Knoxville economic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| I don't know if any of them, I'm sure some of y'all have had young children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| that have been in competitive sports, if you're anything like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| and you end up spending a lot of your weekends in Gatlinburg or Cleveland, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5984)|
| 1:39:52| or Morristown, Tennessee, watching these kids play basketball and football or just whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=5992)|
| 1:40:01| they're doing, I mean, it would be really nice to have a local sports complex with these kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6001)|
| 1:40:09| of fields and these kinds of courts here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6009)|
| 1:40:16| I'd also like to say, with all the traffic this thing will produce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| I mean, it should create some more supportive uses around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| There should be restaurants, there should be retail, there could be possibly a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6024)|
| 1:40:32| I'm kind of like Chris Uden earlier, I rarely, rarely disagree with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| but just knowing this property so well, I think we need to give this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| every ability, every tool he has to make this property work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6044)|
| 1:40:51| I'll say one last thing, when you come into Knoxville, by 40 and 75, let's say you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6051)|
| 1:40:59| 40 east, on your left, that hill that we're talking about here, I mean, that's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| first things you see when you're coming into our great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| I mean, it would be really great to see a nice, clean, good-looking development there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| on the left as you come into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| Having said all of those things, I know I've been long-winded, but it's really because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| know this property so well, I really think we need to support the request for CV zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6089)|
| 1:41:40| Commissioner Corbelett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| There, sorry, had trouble unmuting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| I'm just basically totally confused about this, and I was hoping that I could direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| some questions to staff as well as Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| My first question to Mr. Maddox is, you've given your reasons to get the commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6119)|
| 1:42:08| for the sports complex, but you've not addressed the other zone that you are requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| Do you have anything to speak to on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| Are you referring to the residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| We have just completed a purchase and sale of a property in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6146)|
| 1:42:33| They're on exit 9 Volkswagen Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| We work through Hamilton County and the city of Chattanooga, and it's a development very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| similar to this in that it starts from the road and tiers up two tiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| The front tier is to be retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| The second tier is to be two hotels, and then across the top of this hill, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6170)|
| 1:42:58| currently being leveled out, is a 300-unit Class A apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6178)|
| 1:43:05| That group, a group out of North Carolina, and they own thousands of apartments, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6185)|
| 1:43:12| we work with them through the rezoning process and everything there in Hamilton County, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| they are people that do what they say they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| They back it up, and they're top-notch residential apartment developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| They have given us an LOI on this property to start with a 300-unit apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6207)|
| 1:43:36| in this location, and if successful, then to go to a phase two with an additional 300-unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6216)|
| 1:43:45| apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| It's Class A, it's top-notch, and they're developers that do what they say they'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6227)|
| 1:43:58| The RV will also serve as a buffer for the Buttermilk Road area back in there, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6238)|
| 1:44:09| by the way, I just live not even a half a mile from this property, right back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6249)|
| 1:44:16| on the dead-end Everett Road, so I'm very familiar with this area, and all of this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6256)|
| 1:44:25| be a big increase and boom for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| And when you say sports complex, what do you mean exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| Okay, were you able to review the study that was prepared by Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6277)|
| 1:44:45| No, I don't know of a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| I'm sorry, was it attached to the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| It was sent out as additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| But that study that was, again, it was prepared by Knox County through Visit Knoxville, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6296)|
| 1:45:04| it shows that Knoxville needs like six to ten fields, these would be outside fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6304)|
| 1:45:13| like soccer fields, football fields, baseball fields, they could be multi-use fields, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| then also that there needs to be inside courts for volleyball, basketball, various sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6319)|
| 1:45:29| on the inside, so it would be a combination of those plus all of the supporting facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6329)|
| 1:45:40| which would be things like sports medicine, of course, retail, restaurants, concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6340)|
| 1:45:49| We've got, we've been in contact with, or actually been contacted by numerous hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| that are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| If this sports complex would be the impetus to make this whole thing develop here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6358)|
| 1:46:06| become what would be a beautiful entrance into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6366)|
| 1:46:13| And the hillside, you've got some very steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| I believe that's where the sports complex would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| What would happen to the steep slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| Well, I'm glad you asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| All three, the other three quadrants of this interstate, and you can look at the rockway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6386)|
| 1:46:33| on the opposing side from us, and then across the interstate, all three of those quadrants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| are solid limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| That makes it very difficult to do anything with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| This quadrant is shale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| We've core-drilled it, it's been tested, the top engineers in the country have looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| it, and this one can be flat-toed off to accommodate the restaurants, hotels, retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6413)|
| 1:47:02| the sporting fields, and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| So it would be a flat-toed type development that would look very attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| And what would happen under the Hillside Protection Ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| I know it provides guidance to the county, but how does that relate to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6433)|
| 1:47:22| Well, there would not be a hilltop any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| I think, Commissioner, that we're starting to get into more specific development issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6446)|
| 1:47:35| Well, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| It's not the overall general nature of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| Can I ask one more question to staff, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| If this is rezoned, does it come back to Planning Commission for review as a use-on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6463)|
| 1:47:51| This is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| You know, under the current zoning, it's planned commercial, so we would get an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6473)|
| 1:48:01| review a development that would go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| Under the requested rezoning and plan amendment change to general commercial on the plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6485)|
| 1:48:13| and the rezoning request to CB, staff would not get an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6493)|
| 1:48:23| nor would the Planning Commissioners, to review a plan in the CB Zone District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| unless it were a use-permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| And those are pretty limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| If you look in the CB Zone District, what those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| the CB Zone District is a business and manufacturing zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| and there are, you know, landfills would require a use-on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| but the majority of the uses allowed in that zone district don't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| any sort of secondary public review of the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| Is there any zone that would accommodate the sports complex that would also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| Planning Commission involved in the review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| So, I will say that the existing PC Zone District would allow for review by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6551)|
| 1:49:19| and I believe this use could be accommodated under the planned commercial zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| at least for the PC zoned area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| However, you know, the other zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| you know, the CB is probably the only other one that would permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6574)|
| 1:49:44| sorry, the CB is probably the only other one that would permit this type of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| but the PC is the one that would require site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| The sports complex could apply for that under PC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| And what about the RB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| Sorry, I'm still unmuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| Okay, yes, the RB Zone District, I will go over that one briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6608)|
| 1:50:15| It's a general residential zone district, and so the principal uses of land in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| may range from multi-family to single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| They can multi-dwelling structures and developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| if they have a density of up to 12 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6632)|
| 1:50:37| then that would come through use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| and that's capped, however, at 24 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6641)|
| 1:50:49| So, you know, if it's a higher density under RB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| then it would have to come through use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| If it's a lower density than 12 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| it would not come through use on review in RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6667)|
| 1:51:07| So, a sports complex could develop under PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| and it would go back to Planning Commission for review, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| Let me address that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| Mr. Maddox, right now, the Commission is discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| I would like to go ahead and make my comments on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| This is a difficult piece of property, but it's in a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| My concern is the size of the tract and the impacts it could have on surrounding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| It is topographically challenging and has some constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| The transportation network is somewhat iffy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| Several months ago, the Commission approved the planned development district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6712)|
| 1:51:59| and that was sent to County Commission, and that was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| And I think that allows basically any existing zoning to be bypassed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6723)|
| 1:52:11| and the developer present a detailed physical plan for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6731)|
| 1:52:17| I think that is the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| It protects the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| It actually protects the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| It gives them a lot more latitude in how the property is utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6743)|
| 1:52:29| And I think that if Mr. Maddox, if you look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| I think that would serve you well, and I think it would serve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| I think it would make everybody more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| Rezoning 100 and some acres for this, I think it's going to be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6760)|
| 1:52:48| And we don't need to be focusing on sporting facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| We got to look at all uses permitted in the districts and see if they're compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| We shouldn't be discussing what the intended use are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| We need to be looking at what the end result could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| It could be manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| It could be any number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| So the plan development gives us that latitude to monitor that and protect that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6790)|
| 1:53:17| but also gives the developer the opportunity to move forward with the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| as he is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| So those are my comments, and I will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| Ms. Adams, you're next on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| This is a question for anyone who has seen the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| that Mr. Maddox referenced, and I believe that Commissioner Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| referred to it during agenda review, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| Did the Visit Knoxville survey designate a location for this sports need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| or was it simply saying this would be a good thing for our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| Anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6836)|
| 1:54:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| I believe, can we, because the information came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| representatives of Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Can he address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Because I know he probably has more information about all of the studies that were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| Mr. Maddox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| Yes, that study was done, it was paid for and ordered by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6858)|
| 1:54:26| in conjunction with Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| And it specifically states that this is the best location in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| this specific property, and it points that out directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| If I may, I'd like to address the last comments that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| regarding the PC versus the CV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| If you look at the map there now, half of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| or over about 45% of it, is already CV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| And so what this is doing, the zoning, the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| is dividing this development where one half of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| or approximately, we don't have to do anything any different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| but on the other half of it, we all of a sudden have to get these reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| If we were going to go in there and do mining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| or some other kind of a deteriorous type of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| I could have done that over the last 13 or 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| I've been hit with every kind of a truck stop, gas station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| fueling depot, just numerous things for this property already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6930)|
| 1:55:37| that's been zoned CV, and I could have done any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| But what I'm trying to do here is, I live right back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| I've lived in Knoxville my entire life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| and I'm trying to do something good for the county here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| and something good for this entire area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| and open up this whole end of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| And when we start developments like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| it requires road improvements, and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| And that's what we're working to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| And we need zoning so that we're not trying to do half of it in one zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| and half of it in the other zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| And the sports complexes, as well as some other big events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6972)|
| 1:56:19| that have looked at this same site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| because they're interested in it because of sports coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| they don't want to have to deal with the different requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| Half of it in one property, half of it in another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| One of them is a deal that we recently lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| a big sports complex type of an ancillary use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| that would have brought millions of dollars of tax dollars to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| But we lost it because we weren't zoned correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| This, all this, these developments, these improvements and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| they're going to be designed to Knox County engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| and the requirements for the roads, and all those kinds of things anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| And as far as like-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| Thank you, Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| I guess we're going to harm that rock quarry across the road from us there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| or those truck stops out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| Mr. Maddox, we need to move on to other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| And while I often agree with your very comments, Chairman Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| and ordinarily I would in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| and it's not that I don't disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| it's the fact that this thing has sat here for 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| It is challenging in a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| He already has zonings that could do far more detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7059)|
| 1:57:45| consequences to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| And I want to give him every tool that he can have to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| So you may call it taking a chance or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| but I think it's, one, I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| And I would like to see him unbridled to get this development to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7079)|
| 1:58:04| And with that, I would like to make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| the general commercial and MDR-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| Commissioner Hill, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| Commissioner Browning has, I think, already made one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| Lou, did you already make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7103)|
| 1:58:23| Excuse me, I thought you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| Commissioner Hill can certainly go ahead and make his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| Again, I would like to make a motion to approve general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| and MDR medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| CB business and manufacturing, and RB general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| We need, that's two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| We need just one motion right now, which would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| approves CG, GC general commercial and MDR medium residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| So I'll amend my motion to general commercial and medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| We will need a, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| Go ahead, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| Be sure that it's, to make sure that you note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| the rationale behind any change to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7148)|
| 1:59:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| Give me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7156)|
| 1:59:23| I'm going to say changes in conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| Commissioner Boston, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7170)|
| 1:59:38| Commissioner Boston, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Unmute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| It's hard to do two things at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| Thank you, chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| Mr. Maddox, did you state that the hilltop would be removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7187)|
| 1:59:52| You would have to remove the hilltop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| It has been engineered and it's included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| It's shown in the site plan that I provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| And what's actually happening, it plateaus up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| And then where the top of the hill is rough across there, it's leveled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7209)|
| 2:00:16| It's plateaued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| And then it plateaus down the backside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| And as it plateaus down, well, across the top and then down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| that's where your different sports fields sit in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| And the slopes between the plateaus are used for bleachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7227)|
| 2:00:33| and the different areas, as well as parking and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7233)|
| 2:00:39| A development of this type will have the top engineers in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| working on it and designing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Engineers that are specific to sports-related complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| So everything will be done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| Thank you, Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| Removing a hilltop like that really does concern me on an environmental aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7263)|
| 2:01:12| And I'm also concerned about the impact on the surrounding communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| I know Mr. Maddox said he lives there, but there's some residential just right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7277)|
| 2:01:26| That worries me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| And also, I'd like to echo Chairman Phillips' remark about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| we shouldn't be talking about different uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| Mr. Maddox, I know Mr. Maddox, he's a very experienced developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| I respect him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| I think kind of where we are here on people supporting this or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7310)|
| 2:01:57| is based a lot in, if you could, Mr. Maddox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| being able to explain what is your hesitancy about having a planned zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7320)|
| 2:02:07| That's what everybody's afraid of, is not having the chance to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| Can you explain why you'd rather have no review, other than the obvious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| But I mean, are there reasons that might help other people get on board with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7337)|
| 2:02:23| Thank you for your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| First off, as I mentioned, the zoning is split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| And when you look at the site plan that I provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| a lot of the uses will cross between the two zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| That's the first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| The second thing is, as these fields are developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| and there are ancillary uses around the fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| that work in relation with the sporting facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7373)|
| 2:03:00| we don't know exactly what those are at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| There'll be like concessions, there'll be restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| there'll be sports medicine, there'll be different uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| And there could be 25 or 30 different uses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| And what happens in a development like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| when you have each one of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| would require us coming back before the planning staff to review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| to talk to us about the parking and the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| and how to use the slopes and the different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| When we're going to have top professional engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| working on that, that are experienced in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| and what that, but when you kind of go back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| 25 times on each of these different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| it delays these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| This could, it could delay it for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| Now on the RV over there, that is, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| and there again, that's a buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| the question that was mentioned earlier about the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| that's a buffer between this commercial zoning and the residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| And if we go over 12 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| we're going to be coming back for a review there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| We're also, as part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| I've had meetings, KUB, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| LCUB has updated their substation in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| for electrical power, preparing for this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7470)|
| 2:04:36| I met just this past week with West Knox Utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| They're going to run a new sewer line down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| They needed an area for a pump station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| that would serve that entire area there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| not only our property, but other properties around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| I'm working with them to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| We're doing everything we can to really help this entire area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| to develop and open up this end of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| There's a lot of traffic that goes from Barabit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| and all the areas around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| It goes up Hardin Valley to go to Oak Ridge and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| This thing will help open up all that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| new roads and everything that it takes to make it move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| Thank you, Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7521)|
| 2:05:21| We've got to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| We've got two more commissioners would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7522)|
| 2:05:28| Commissioner Korbelik, please unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| Yes, I have a question for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| And that question is, I'm not familiar with how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| planned commercial plan development works exactly in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| But typically, when you have a large project like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| you can come up with an overall concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| And then it can be handled as the phasing goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| It can be handled administratively by the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| And if they see that there is a discrepancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| between the intent of the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| then they would kick it back to the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| But otherwise, it's handled administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| Is that technique available here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| Can he come in with a concept plan for the entire project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| that deals with general infrastructure, roads, landscaping, just in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7581)|
| 2:06:28| and then staff can oversee it as phasing occurs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7588)|
| 2:06:34| Thank you for your question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| Generally, for a project of this size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| there are some minor modifications that staff can approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| once a concept plan has gone to the planning commission and been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| Those are fairly minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| I think what you're talking about might be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| than the process that we currently have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| I have a few comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| One, I think that something of this magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| would go through a series of plans review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| once it's approved, if it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| And so all of these separate projects would end up being phased anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| I don't think anyone's denying that this would be a great addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| But something of this magnitude and any great design requires review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| So I am in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| But it was a bit, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7648)|
| 2:07:34| to imply that no one should review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| If it's going to be great for this part of town, it requires review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| And no one's denying that it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| So I just wanted to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7668)|

| 2:12:40| And after this one, we'll take a 10 minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| The applicant is Mark Miller, Realty Trust Group, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| Location is north side of Danaher Road, east of Connor Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| near East Emory Road and I-75 intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| Size of tract is 3.85 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| Present zoning is CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| Zoning requested OB office, medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| Existing land use is agriculture, forestry and vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| Staff recommendation approve OB office, medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| Zoning because it is consistent with the Emory Road I-75 mixed use district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8000)|
| 2:13:26| The MUST NCO-4 designation for the north county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8006)|
| 2:13:32| and compatible with surrounding development and zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| Mr. Miller, is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8019)|
| 2:13:45| Mr. Miller, you're free to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| Yeah, we just like to get this zoned for medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| Currently, all the buildings that are adjacent to us on Danaher Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8034)|
| 2:13:59| they're all medical use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=8039)|
