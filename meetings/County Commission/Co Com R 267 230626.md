|  120    |  123    | I have had a week to pray about what I'm going to pray about,                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=120.0)              |
|  124    |  130    | and in praying about it, I found out that there is a county commissioner in the Old Testament,             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=124.0)              |
|  130    |  138    | and in the capacity that Nehemiah served as the cupbearer to Artaxerxes, he was very much like you guys,   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=130.0)              |
|  138    |  142    | and he was very much in need of folks to support him.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=138.0)              |
|  142    |  149    | In his time, his community, his name in and of itself means the comfort of God,                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=142.0)              |
|  149    |  156    | and he was appointed in that time to be a leader out of an exile,                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=149.0)              |
|  156    |  159    | and his heart was burdened for his community.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=156.0)              |
|  159    |  164    | It was so burdened he went back to Jerusalem to find the walls of that city,                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=159.0)              |
|  164    |  169    | once a great and mighty fortress destroyed and laying asunder on the ground,                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=164.0)              |
|  169    |  173    | and he was broken before the Lord because of it,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=169.0)              |
|  173    |  177    | and the Lord strengthened him to do something quite miraculous.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=173.0)              |
|  177    |  183    | What it took almost 90 years to build, which the enemy had torn down in a day,                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=177.0)              |
|  183    |  188    | he was able to organize his community to rebuild in 52 days,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=183.0)              |
|  188    |  193    | and he did so by arming the people with a consciousness,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=188.0)              |
|  193    |  197    | and it's impossible to do what you do and legislate morality,                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=193.0)              |

|  213    |  217    | and what Nehemiah was able to accomplish is he took those people back,                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=213.0)              |
|  217    |  219    | and he said this is who we are,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=217.0)              |

|  225    |  226    | and I had to ask him.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=225.0)              |

|  831    |  836    | And because of that, as Commissioner Fraser said,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=831.0)              |
|  836    |  839    | we're called on approximately 300 and something times,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230626?start=836.0)              |
