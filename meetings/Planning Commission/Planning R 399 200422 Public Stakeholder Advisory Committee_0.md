| 0:12:21| Our requested use requests go to the Planning Commission for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| The Planning Commission had reviewed, had been in this position prior in the use on review request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| and hillside areas and subdivisions went before the Planning Commission for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| and they were able to modify the strict interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| One, the best example I can think of is the multifamily development on Hollywood Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| where in order to save a portion of the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| the Planning Commission enabled a reduction in the front setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| so the building could move into the flatter portion of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| and there was some disturbance of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| The Planning Commission mandated that the portion of the slope had to be reseeded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| and reforested to better protect that steeper slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| The question before the committee is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| is the administration of the hillside protection overlay provisions of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| and Knoxville zoning ordinance by Knoxville and the Knox County Planning staff the better approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| Second question, is the Planning Commission the appropriate body to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| and approve deviations from the strict standards of the hillside protection overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| with appeals to City Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| And three, should the provision of incentives for preserving steep slopes be evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| and, if deemed appropriate, an amendment be drafted proposing incentives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| With that, I'd like to have questions, discussion, and any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Well, I think that one or two are yes, from my standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| that it should be the planning staff for question number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| and yes, deviations should go to the Planning Commission with regard to incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| for preserving steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| It sounds good to have an evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| I would urge that this be a very thorough evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| Looking at other committees is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| but we need to also sort of vet it pretty well here at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| particularly if you're going to give density bonuses for adding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| for protecting this steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| If we proceed with that, it would be a very thorough investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| looking at how other communities do it, but also the implications for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| Daryl, this is Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| I agree with number one and two, as Mary stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| and I also think number three does need to be looked into in terms of what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| really talking about in terms of incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| and I think that it should be looked into very carefully from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| But one and two, I agree, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| With the idea that it be looked into thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| I've got a motion from Mary and a second from Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| Can we hear from Peter real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Yes, Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I just wanted to put my full support behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| It's one of those things where a lot of times when people get into my world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| they've already got their drawings and their plans developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| And a lot of times in the overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| our customers are familiar with going to planning staff when they're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| in, when they're first starting the initial design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| And so when density is really regulated by the slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| I think it is appropriate for folks to continue on the same path that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| accustomed to and reach out to planning staff to know what the parameters are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| so they know how to design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| So Gerald, is the motion for all three or just the first two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| Let's do the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| I think it would be easier to do the motion for the first two and then maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| a separate motion and a little discussion on number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Mary and Duane are agreeable to that as Mary making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| I am Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=989)|

| 0:16:31| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| I moved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| I moved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Any further discussion or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Shall I go ahead and make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| I move that question number one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| The answer is yes to both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| And I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1009)|

| 0:20:03| Just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| At this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1210)|

| 0:20:14| whether there are incentives that might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| And then how would they affect and be implemented in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| I agree that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1221)|

| 0:20:35| And we also keep those from being totally deforested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1235)|

| 0:20:41| So I think, you know, how we, how we draw up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| The specifics on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=1244)|

| 0:41:40| sign guidelines in the institutional zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| regardless of what, if you pick it up from other zones or whatever, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| there needs to be a separate designation within that zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2507)|

| 0:42:11| questions, a lot of questions, and the realization that undertaking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2531)|

| 0:42:25| each one of the zones ought to have the guidelines for what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2545)|

| 0:42:31| and I feel pretty strongly that the institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2551)|

| 0:46:20| that internal road, which is typically a cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2780)|

| 0:47:11| wayfinding is super important. I think people follow Google Maps to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| find a hospital or something, but once they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| get there, they rely on wayfinding to get in, and I think those signs need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| appropriate scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| Any other comments? I think it's important to remember that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| we're not talking about small projects in the future. We're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2855)|

| 0:47:43| as some context, in BZA, we're getting a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| larger developments that are zoned office park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2867)|

| 0:47:59| developments. In office park, it's 24 square foot for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2879)|

| 0:48:07| like, you guys need to look at that, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2887)|

| 0:48:14| not nearly enough to provide any sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| advertising measures. But anyways, for context, we're looking at future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| development that's five acres or bigger, and to put really severe limitations on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2904)|
| 0:48:32| signage for those developments, I think we're setting ourselves up for a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| more variance requests that may be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| I agree with Peter on that, since being on the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| and one of the issues I see with it is buildings are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| multi-sided, and a building can be facing a residential community and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2931)|

| 0:49:00| issues that we've dealt with, that when the siding ordinance says that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2940)|

| 0:49:09| a particular building and zoning, but one side of the building is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| inappropriate, and the other side is very well appropriate, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| it has to look, and the same thing with wayfinding. People think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2959)|
| 0:49:26| big signs are better wayfinding, but being ground level signs and being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| where they can be viewed better from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| vehicle or pedestrian makes more sense. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| to me, more study has to be done with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| but I do also agree with Joe with this. Institutional signage is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| different than commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=2989)|

| 0:50:03| when I go to the zone and I look up institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| I want to see the guidelines that are specifically for institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| not to go to commercial or industrial districts. I think that a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| of the points that you folks brought up, those are the kind of things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3016)|

| 0:50:24| that institutional ought to have its own set of guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| whether it's a combination of commercial and industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| part of that, but there ought to be a section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3031)|

| 0:50:43| I understand that, but we've got the practice of the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| the ordinance, the standards. It appears, and I wasn't part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3050)|

| 0:51:03| categories of the uses. That's something that we can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| and look forward and look at in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3067)|

| 0:56:17| Jennifer, will you go into your points, though, that you were asking, because I wanted to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| what you were saying. I wish I knew Robert's rule of order a little better. I am in passionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3380)|
| 0:56:28| disagreement with this. I don't see how a new institutional sign section is going to solve any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3388)|
| 0:56:37| problems. It's going to create a lot of variability among the uses that are in those institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| zones. I would make a substitute motion or something that we make some type of note in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3405)|
| 0:56:53| institutional zones and recode that says, here's where you look for your sign regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3413)|
| 0:57:00| Where would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| So, when you say that, for example, the commercial section to find the code for the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| section. For the uses, yeah. Like, Gerald was confused. Everyone was saying, no, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3434)|
| 0:57:24| discussion, no, we don't need a new institutional sign section for this, and then the motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3444)|
| 0:57:36| If I could real quick, you can do a motion to reconsider in terms of the Robert's rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| issue. That can be brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| This is Brian. I'd like to make a motion to reconsider. I kind of got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| lost on the discussion, because everybody was leaning towards, no, we don't need another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| regulation, and then all of a sudden this popped up, and I'll be honest with you, I kind of got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| lost on the discussion. I'd like to make a motion to reconsider, and my vote would be, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| we don't need another regulation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Before we vote, I want to raise a point, because I'm not clear. What I have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3487)|
| 0:58:26| Wayne say in the initial motion was develop guidelines for institutional zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3506)|
| 0:58:34| Guidelines are different from regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| That's my take, and that's perhaps where some of the confusion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3518)|
| 0:58:46| My understanding is that, and Dwayne will have to add, what Dwayne wanted was new standards in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| the zoning code for signs in the institutional district. Is that correct, Dwayne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| Yes. Okay, well, I'm going to say new. I want under the institutional zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3538)|
| 0:59:07| guidelines and standards for signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| I want to be able to go to the institutional zone, and I want to see a section in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| that says signage. So, could that section not be what's in the commercial, if that's what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| already being used, basically, but I thought that's what I heard. I think that's what needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| to be looked into. I'm sorry, Mary, go ahead. If it's guidelines, the first step before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3566)|
| 0:59:37| developing regulations is to see what type of thing is needed and whether we already have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| So, this would be, in a way, checking out, okay, how well does the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3584)|
| 0:59:53| side ordinance fit with the new institutional zone? That's a first pass, and to me, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3593)|
| 1:00:03| how you develop guidelines, and then from there, you decide whether you need something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3603)|
| 1:00:12| So, I thought what we were looking at was to explore this issue further, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| as to how good the fit would be with commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| I don't think that we want to explore specific institutional signs further. We want to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3626)|
| 1:00:34| what we have in office park and commercial and what's already in the sign ordinance for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| institutional. I would say that the institutional zone is different enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| that likely adopting for this. That was our discussion before. This is my discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| the motion. Whether it's exploring separate institutional sign standards or setting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| writing institutional sign regulations, my vote is no. So, my question, again, then, Jennifer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| is this. So, let's say we, and to Mary's point, we adopt the commercial signage guidelines and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3669)|
| 1:01:20| regulations and apply them to the institutional in instances where there's a conflict between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| the two, then how would that kind of thing be addressed? There's a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3686)|
| 1:01:35| to reconsider. And my new motion would be to, you know, take the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3695)|
| 1:01:43| recommendation is that we do not amend the sign ordinance. And whether we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| evaluate amending the sign ordinance or saying, yes, go amend the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| I don't want to do that. I think Duane's motion was to explore amending the sign ordinance. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3715)|
| 1:02:03| don't want to do that. I think we've explored it enough. I think the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| So, my question, though, is if we use the existing ordinances and we apply them on the institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| zone areas where there's a conflict there, where it's not meeting the intent for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| institutional, but they do meet the intent for the commercial, how does those type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| conflicts get resolved is my question. We'll apply the current standards. There are standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| for signs in institutional districts. I'm aware of no requests for variances, no challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3754)|
| 1:02:44| or conflicts between the desires of the businesses wanting, and I'll get to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| Amy, businesses wanting those signs and standards, but we will continue to monitor. We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3770)|
| 1:02:58| The staff on a regular basis, and we'll make you aware. So, not amending the ordinance at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| but monitoring it, I believe, is the proper approach. And if there is a challenge or problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| we'll come back to the planning commission and the stakeholder committee with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| Amy, did you have a question? Well, I just kind of wanted to remind everybody again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| we're talking about property that would be rezoned, five acre properties that would be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3798)|
| 1:03:27| in the city. So, I think there's a lot of, well, the odds of finding something, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| there's going to be a lot of, that's a big project. There would be lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| public discussion in ways to address that if we really thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| that was going to be an issue. Otherwise, I think we can, again, I think we're looking at opening up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| a whole sign ordinance for a one in a million chance that something's going to happen immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| And there's other ways to deal with an unsavory development or unsavory signage as part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3841)|
| 1:04:09| rezoning or use on review process. So, Amy, are you saying then in some way that when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3849)|
| 1:04:18| dealing with the whole sign ordinances and revising them and amending them a few years back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| that we're going to have that kind of contentious back and forth for an extended long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| just because of this one issue? Yes. Okay. That would be my fear, yes. And I echo that fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3869)|
| 1:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| Hey, Gerald, first of all, I think, again, you know, I keep saying that what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| is we're trying to look to the future, too, and we're trying to develop a zoning ordinance or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| codes that hopefully are going to apply. And first of all, we don't know how big our city's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| get, you know, in terms of making changes in the future. And again, I go back to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| the institutional zone, which was not considered when the sign task force was working and we went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| through that whole thing, that was not a zone. Had it been a zone, I think that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| developed sign standards for that particular zone. And again, I go back to when we go to the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3917)|
| 1:05:24| ordinance and we look up an institutional, that we ought to be considering what the signs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3924)|
| 1:05:31| and how they do apply on that. And I really think that that should be looked into and applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3931)|
| 1:05:39| So I stand by what I said. I understand that, but I think, again, I echo Amy's fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| that the industrial mixed-use district is a new district for all intents and purposes. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| regional commercial district is a new district. The RN-3 district is a new district. The RN-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3953)|

| 1:06:06| We open up for the institutional, there's a desire for additional signage or different signage for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| the regional commercial. For industrial mixed-use, we just start snowballing. And you stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3973)|
| 1:06:21| we're looking towards a future where the zoning ordinance, when we crafted new standards and new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| districts, we had policy that directed us, existing issues and opportunities that directed us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3986)|
| 1:06:35| when we're not saying, well, we have a fear that this may happen, so we're crafting things. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| trying to provide opportunities and avenues to enable opportunities, not putting roadblocks up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4001)|
| 1:06:50| for something that we have no example of realization of that fear. It's unknown at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4010)|

| 1:07:54| And it was very important that we made them mandatory, that they were, had to be followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4074)|
| 1:08:02| in other words, and so I don't think you, I don't think you have a process for developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| guidelines unless you're going to adhere to those guidelines, and so ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4089)|
| 1:08:17| I'm going to vote yes on the reconsideration because I do think it opens up a can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| I would want to be on a committee for developing guidelines as well because I believe they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| overly restrictive, so I would be on the side of making them less restrictive. We always, we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| that it's just about, you know, making things more restrictive, not necessarily. I would be on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| side of making them less restrictive for the reasons that I outlaid earlier, so, or outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| earlier, so anyway, I'm going to vote yes on the reconsideration. Yeah, I understand what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| saying, Joe. One quick comment from Peter, and then we'll call the question. So, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| important to note we've got all new zoning districts. We don't have any carryovers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| and when we were going through the whole recode process, the goal was not to, we were told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| don't open up the parking section, don't open up the zoning section, and so throughout that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| multi-year process, we went, we looked at each of these new zones, and we grouped them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4156)|
| 1:09:24| and basically created the new, well, implemented them into the new sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4164)|
| 1:09:32| You know, we look at, I went to somebody else's office, and I looked at what the previous zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| were, and you know, South College was C6. We've got others that were planned commercial. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| were all commercially zoned before, and so it's most appropriate that the institutional signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4183)|
| 1:09:53| would be consistent with the commercial signage. That's what it was in the end of 2019, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| for, I think for this committee to go and say, you know what, we're going to reopen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| the whole sign ordinance because we've got new zoning districts, and the old might not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| appropriate today. I'm not sure that's what we're tasked to do. Does that make sense? Did I lose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4212)|
| 1:10:21| I understand what you're saying, Peter. I'm not asking that you open the whole thing. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| saying that under the institutional, under each one of the zones, we have signing standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| right? Right. And so I'm saying that we should have signing standards for institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4229)|
| 1:10:37| We do. So, Dwayne, if the institutional development section now had the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4237)|
| 1:10:48| signage rules regulations put in them as they are now, would that accomplish what you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| about? Being able to have it right there in front of you? Partially. I think it needs to be looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| at. It certainly sounds like that is the quickest route to at least getting past this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| thing. So, that would be my recommendation. Gerald and I have been up against this for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| the last week or so. And I've enjoyed my discussions with you. What? I've enjoyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4274)|
| 1:11:22| my conversation with you. Absolutely. Peter has something. I just want to say it's important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| remember that six months ago, the sign standards were fine for those C6, for those PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| what we now call institutional. The use, the development hasn't changed. And if it was great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| on December 31st, if we change the name of it and now they're not great, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4303)|
| 1:11:51| I guess I don't understand that logic. I think that Gerald and the whole team put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| a pretty good path forward to push the old zones into the new zones and label them appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4317)|
| 1:12:06| It just, it doesn't make sense to me to, once something is renamed, it's the same development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4326)|
| 1:12:14| Just because you call it a different zoning district doesn't mean we have to create brand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| new standards. The development has stayed the same. I think the standards should remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| Then why did we do it? We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Can I call the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| I'll call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| Could you call the roll for the vote? What are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Yes, I was going to request a clarification of the motion. I have that Brian, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4356)|

| 1:12:50| Yes, and I think to ask for Brian and Jennifer to confirm, but the reconsideration would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4370)|
| 1:12:59| not take any steps to amend the sign ordinance for the institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4379)|

| 1:16:10| Just a number of districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| A lot of the commercial area of the city was a planned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| And under the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| because, as Peter stated previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| staff was directed not to make any changes to the signed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| we carried forward that provision to enable the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| to review requests for additional signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| And appointed them to the commercial districts and the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4598)|
| 1:16:47| There's a concern that that is inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| and the question is whether the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| should still continue with that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| But rather than having those requests for additional signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| go before the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| A variance requires a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| There may be cases where additional signage is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| based on the topography of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| or number of buildings, or orientation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| or just the complexity of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| That would not warrant a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| The concern, I think, is that the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| would inappropriately approve additional signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| In the five years I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| the Planning Commission has received one request for additional signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| And there are guidelines in the ordinance for the approval that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| or not guidelines, but standards that must,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| the Planning Commission must show have been met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| in approving additional signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| So the staff recommendation is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| authority remain with the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| to, on a case-by-case basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| approve additional signage for developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| when that signage meets the standards set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4684)|
| 1:18:13| This question went before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| The Planning Commission unanimously recommended that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| that provision and authority remain with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| With that, I'll open it up for discussion and questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| I'll move that we accept the recommendation of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| and the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| I think the Planning Commission is a broad-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| a pointed group, and it should remain with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| And I believe Terrence seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4722)|

| 1:20:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| The final report before you or action item is with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| the R-N-2 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| There are two questions embodied in this and I'll do what I think will be the quick one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| There were two questions that came from a city council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| One of those was should the minimum lot area for R-N-2 be increased to 6,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| This was brought up during review of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Staff recommendation is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Staff recommendation is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| We reviewed the R-N-2 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| The current minimum lot size is 5,000 square feet and if we increase that to 6,000 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| feet, we'll take over 3,000 lots that are now conforming, non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| So staff recommendation on that is no and I'd like to hear any discussion of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4853)|
| 1:21:01| on that one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Then we'll go to the next question involved with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| Yes, Mary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| I again think that looking at what something is currently zoned is not the right way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| go in terms of figuring out what should be done with this particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4874)|
| 1:21:21| We have a big job as I'm sure you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| R-N-1 has a minimum of 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| R-N-2 and I believe it is two or three other districts have a minimum lot size of about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4888)|
| 1:21:36| 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| It doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4898)|
| 1:21:45| R-2 used to be 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| I saw that it dropped in the first draft to 7,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| Having it be the same as R-N-3, etc., it doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4915)|
| 1:22:03| I think that's a better question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| Yeah, Brian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| It makes sense from a standpoint that all these lots are the same width and the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| are different on the R-N-2, R-N-3, and R-N-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| So essentially, if you're not changing the width of the requirement of the lot, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| just making it, you just are allowed a smaller backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| Okay, but I want to go back to what you're saying, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| I just went through a rezoning issue in my neighborhood where they were going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| a lot, about an acre, and they wanted R-2, R-N-2 for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| They could have subdivided it to eight lots, which is quite different from if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| So that's when you're applying this looking forward as opposed to what you're dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| with with the existing lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| So you're in R-N-1 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Is this a specific case in R-N-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| So they were asking for a rezoning to R-N-2 so they could do a 50-foot lot width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| No, it wasn't necessarily the lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| It was taking the one acre existing lot and dividing it off into smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=4992)|
| 1:23:22| So it didn't have to do with the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| It was actually, it was an interior lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| So it's going to have a private way in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| I think keeping it 5,000 square feet in R-N-2 actually protects R-N-1 better because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| is so outside of what you find in the rest of your neighborhood, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| The 6,000 and 7,500 numbers are arbitrary, and I would agree with Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| They don't reflect what's on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Myself and our organization are really supportive of the 5,000 square feet because it is so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| consistent with what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| And for redevelopment, housing affordability, infill, being able to do infill is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| be so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5042)|
| 1:24:02| And the 5,000 square feet is really consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5042)|
| 1:24:09| Thanks, Jennifer and Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| And the second question I have, the next one that we'll deal with is do we need another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| zoning district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| But keep in mind the one statement I made that if we increase the minimum lot area for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| R-N-2 to 6,000 square feet, we create over 3,000 nonconforming lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5064)|
| 1:24:31| These lots are currently conforming because we do have a lot, a number of older lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| neighborhoods in the city that have 5,000 square foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| And if we make the, increase the minimum lot area to 6,000 square feet, we'll make all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| those lots nonconforming, making it more difficult to do additions, improvements, or if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5086)|
| 1:24:53| a vacant lot, to rebuild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| So again, the staff recommendation is to keep that at 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5095)|
| 1:25:02| And again, keep in mind for further discussion, the next question I'll bring up is should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| there be another single family district with a lot area of 7,500 or 7,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5106)|
| 1:25:14| I make a motion to keep this R-N-2 lot area at 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5114)|
| 1:25:22| I'd second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| Motion from Brian, seconded by Don to keep the minimum lot area for R-N-2 at 5,000 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5126)|

| 1:25:37| I do have one more point, which is that this is being considered, treated as low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| residential in the sector plan, R-N-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5144)|

| 1:25:55| I mean, it doesn't make sense to call a lot that is the same as R-N-3 another, a 5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5155)|
| 1:26:06| square foot lot used to be, that used to be under general residential is now being categorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5166)|
| 1:26:15| as low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| How is it low density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| Well, how, well, first of all, I think our sector plan, I know our sector plans are updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| and one of our high priority tasks for the coming year is to update our sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5187)|
| 1:26:33| But, and I'll be frank, we live in a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| I know we live in a city, but there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| Eight blocks to an acre is low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| We do not live in 1955 anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5200)|

| 1:26:49| We live in an urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| And we're talking about 20 feet difference in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| If you had to go to 6,000 square feet, that makes the backyard 20 feet longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| Which arguably would look worse and more out of proportion than 50 by 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5221)|

| 1:29:28| They were either older lots, some 50 by 150 area lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| or they were developed under the old zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| when the fairly standard minimum lot size was 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| There is noted in the information I sent you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| there are 24,883 properties owned RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| 10,541 of those properties, or 40%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| have a lot area of less than 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| And 14,342, or 57%, have a lot area size of 7,500 square feet more than there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5401)|
| 1:30:11| So there does seem to be some justification for a medium in-between zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5411)|
| 1:30:22| The concern is that, start at this, is there's a concern that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| someone will go into a neighborhood with 7,500 square foot lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| buy two adjoining properties, demolish the homes, create three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| And I have to read this because I think my prose was eloquent here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| that that would result in, what did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| The concern is that this type of redevelopment would create gridlock on the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| destroy the character of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| and the resulting density would overwhelm the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| So that's the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| That the concern is that, start at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| that resulted in this recommendation or request from City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| was that someone would go into existing neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| buy two adjoining lots, and demolish the homes, and create three new lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5469)|
| 1:31:18| So the question before you, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| 57% of the lot zoned R&D do have a lot area of 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5480)|
| 1:31:27| The question is, should there be a new zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| with a minimum lot area of 7,000 or 7,500 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| The staff recommendation is not to amend the ordinance at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| but to monitor development activity for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| to see if there is a move towards buying existing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| demolishing them, and creating smaller lots in established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| In the four months or so since the enactment of the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| wherever this happened, at any place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5522)|
| 1:32:10| Aaron, did you have, Aaron Gill, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| Oh, no. Sorry, I had to just drop back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| Oh, okay. Any questions, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| Jared, I have a question. It's Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| Would this come with a change in minimum lot width as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| That's something we haven't even looked at yet, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| That would be, if we decided to pursue this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| we'd have to look at the existing lots that are 7,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| and use those as a template for the new zoning district standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Another thing we haven't looked at is whether the lots that are 75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| existing lots that are 7,500 square feet and more are clustered together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| or are they interspersed with smaller lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| so making mapping more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| So, if we do pursue a new zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| we've got a lot of background research to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| Just a brief, I'm on KGS now looking at lots around my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| It's RN2, mostly, there are mostly 7,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5601)|
| 1:33:29| but all the lots are essentially 50 foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| You couldn't buy two lots and demolish the two houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| if the 50 foot lot width still remained in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| So, I don't know that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| essentially what you'd be doing by creating a new zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| we'd be rezoning these RN2s into this new zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| to make them comply at 7,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| but then it puts a bunch of little edge lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| that are available for some infill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| kind of on the cusp of falling out of favor with this new zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| So, I don't see a need for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| but this is just looking at a snapshot on some lots around South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| And when we did some research early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| when this question came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| we noted the same thing you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| that many of the lots that are 7,500 square feet or less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| are 50 feet in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| So, even if you bought two adjacent lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| and demolished the homes on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| you could not create three lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| because you wouldn't have the lot width required for three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| Right, that's why I was asking if you were going to reduce the lot width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| or to anything, you know, change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| Yeah, this is Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| Unless you bought two lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| and one of them was a corner lot with 100 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| or 150 foot length on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| You could divide that up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| It's also important to take in consideration the market here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| Like, if you take two lots with two houses on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| and you tear them down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5714)|
| 1:35:14| it's an expensive endeavor to build three new houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| when you had two perfectly good houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Now, if it makes sense to tear two houses down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| that are dilapidated and underperforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| then that's probably a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| to tear two houses down and build three new houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| in an infill situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| So, you know, the market probably has something to bear on this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| But this is Chad again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| I've also seen, you know, development in Western cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| that property values have gone up a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| And it happens really quickly where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| you know, the integrity of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| historical integrity of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| can get changed really quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| before planning can even get a handle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| So, I think it's worth having the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| the special zoning for the 7,500 square foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5760)|
| 1:36:09| Gerald, this is Andy again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| What percentage or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| do you know what this really affects percentage-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| and sort of geography?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| Not really, not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| I haven't done enough research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| The only thing that I can tell you is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| 57% of the land that's in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| that 57% of the lots zoned are into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| do have a lot of area of 7,500 square feet or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| Again, the question that comes up are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| are those lots clustered so that we could zone them easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| and not make lots non-conforming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Or are they interspersed with smaller lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| I think Brian Hahn brought up a good point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| even if you have two adjacent 70 or lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| that are 7,500 square feet, but have 50 foot lot widths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| you can't demolish the homes and create three lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| you don't have the lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| As Chad said, if one of those lots was a corner lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| and had a 150 foot lot depth, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| There's a lot of research that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| Even if we do move forward with looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| creating a new zoning district with the larger lot area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| there's a good deal of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| It's not a simple and quick undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| I make a motion to table this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| Like you said, this is a lot of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| At this time, I make a motion that we do not create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| another residential zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5864)|
| 1:37:44| Are you seconding it or making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5864)|
| 1:37:52| Let me just ask for clarification real fast here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| Brian, was your motion to table it or to take no action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| Take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| I make a motion that we do not go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| to further investigate creating a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| residential zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| So take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Okay, I'm going to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Does the second agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Okay, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| Second by Pat Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| I just got a quick question now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| Somebody mentioned infill lots doing infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| One way or the other, how does this impact the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| to do that given the fact that we are talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| and I'm assuming these are mostly inner city lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| for the most part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| They're scattered all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| They're typically older, but there are some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| in Fountain City, some in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| some in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| Not many of the smaller lots in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| But with the 5,000 square foot lot size, maintaining that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| it may make infill and redevelopment a bit easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5945)|
| 1:39:13| Okay, well, I want to make it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| because I think the availability and the portability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| is where I'm focusing my energies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| on this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| Yeah, and that was one of the reasons for creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| the 5,000 square foot lot size for R&T| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| to make redevelopment and rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| of homes on those smaller lots easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| Dory, could you call the roll for the vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5981)|
| 1:39:41| Complete the motion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| The motion is to take no action on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| In taking no action, staff won't move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| with creating an intermediate zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| but we will continue to monitor the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| And if it becomes an issue, the demolition of existing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| the combining of lots to create smaller lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| we will let the prize committee of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| and let you know so that you can take appropriate action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| Can I, let me, I thought you said table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6014)|

| 1:40:22| Okay, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Mary first and Dwayne, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| If I could, I think we need a bit more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| We have an idea of how many, roughly what percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| of RM2 is oversized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| What about the percentage of RM1 that are undersized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6039)|
| 1:40:47| I think we can gather that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| and have it by the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| So why don't we table this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| and then we could take no action after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Table it for you to get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| I agree with Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6062)|

| 1:41:09| And I'll ask Christina to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6069)|

| 1:41:19| and assuming that fails a new one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| on whether or not we want to table this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| pending more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6085)|

| 1:45:32| Yeah, I think Terrence, the motion on this one was to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| Now, but then wasn't the second part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6340)|

| 1:45:54| Staff will continue to monitor this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| And in response to the question about RN1, we'll bring information to the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6356)|

| 1:46:26| But I thought since that one prevailed, I thought that one xed out the motion I'm about to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6386)|
| 1:46:34| which is to table rather than to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| To table while staff gathers information on other zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| Right, so I thought that's what Christina said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| We have to make this motion, take no action, again, come back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| I move to table the issue while staff gathers more information on the number of lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6411)|
| 1:47:00| that are roughly 7,500 square feet in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6425)|

| 1:47:30| I think the vote was really close and there's several members that had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| So, it speaks to me that we need more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200422-public-stakeholder-advisory-committee?start=6454)|
