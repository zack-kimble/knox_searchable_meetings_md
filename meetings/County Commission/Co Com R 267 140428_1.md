| 2:21:14| it just didn't make sense to me to open it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| and so I concur with that and will vote within the affirmative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| to keep the road closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| We had a similar, this is very similar to Carnes in some respects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| but we had the same discussion of a Carnes subdivision earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| but it was around the middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| there was only one way in and out of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| This one has multiple, and so I kind of feel the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| that the other commissioners do, that that was a safety issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| and this one there's already multiple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| and I think that Nubbins Ridge right there, I don't know that they could handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| where you would have to put that with the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| I don't know that it would be as safe as I would like for it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| so I'm going to vote in the same realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8517)|
| 2:22:02| Is that a legal vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| Is that a legal vote, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| It's not something that I've run across before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| What's before you now is the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| and there's not really a road on the table at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| If a road were proposed to be opened, it would be part of a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| that would come back before the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| and then through the process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| You can make that part of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| I'm not sure about the legal effect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| If a development plan comes back through with a road or without a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| you're going to see this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| The question I have about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| just about while we have an opportunity, is to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| I guess if you're going to open that road, it would have to come back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| and it wouldn't be something that would not be appealable to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8573)|
| 2:23:01| Because we're the ones that open and close those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| Like I say, what's before you now is the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| There's not a road before you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| It will have to come back before you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| Regardless of what your vote is now, it will come back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| If the commission were to change its mind at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| it would be no different than refusing to open a road today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| and then deciding to open it again next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| To any extent, I think you've heard what the sentiments of the commission are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8607)|
| 2:23:35| Dan is saying that that's not part of this motion that the road was opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| That's what I was going to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| Basically, we're not even approving a road open and close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| We're just approving this, and if they do open the road to developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| then he would have to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| What I was saying, though, is that you're hearing what the sentiments of the commission are now anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8631)|
| 2:24:00| Can we go on record with a formal vote saying we do not want that road open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| Now, I know it has no legal binding effect, but can we come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8645)|
| 2:24:09| we're sending a message to these folks at MPC, we're sending a message to the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8649)|
| 2:24:14| we're not going to vote to open that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| So if they come in and say, well, let's do it anyway, we're saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| I mean, I would like to have that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| Just for the record, if this property is rezoned per the agenda, you will not see any of this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8665)|
| 2:24:37| All that will be approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| The development plan will be approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| So if you want to make your wishes known, one way would be to condition the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| so that you don't permit connections to existing streets other than Nubbin Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| That was part of his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| Well, then let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8697)|
| 2:24:58| Did you understand it that way, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| That's what I wrote down, but then the further discussion was that there wasn't that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8701)|
| 2:25:07| Mark it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| That's part of his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| That's part of his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| So, again, restate for me the motion so I fully understand the wording of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8712)|
| 2:25:18| Approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| Approve per MPC recommendation with an amendment that the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8720)|
| 2:25:27| I believe is the name of it, will be kept closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| Commissioner McKenzie, you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| Yeah, that's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| All right, does everybody understand the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| All right, we have a first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8743)|
| 2:25:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| Any other business before the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140428?start=8752)|
