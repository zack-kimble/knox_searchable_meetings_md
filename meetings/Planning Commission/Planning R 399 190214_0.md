| 0:01:26| Many of the items we vote on require further action by the city council or county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| and in the handout is the meeting schedule of these legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| For matters that are forwarded to the county commission for final action, particularly rezoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=96)|

| 0:02:27| At this time, the applicant may address the commission or defer his or her opening remarks and allow any opposition to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=147)|

| 0:03:19| All speakers should come to the podium and speak directly into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=199)|

| 0:11:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Motion to approve consent is read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Lomax to approve consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| We're going to our agenda, and the first item is item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=705)|
| 0:12:05| The applicant is John G. Moore III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| The location is south of Dean Hill Drive and Cheshire Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| The approximate size of the tract is 2.85 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| Present zoning is R1 low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| The zoning requested is RP-1 planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Existing land use is rural residential, and proposed use is PUD 14 condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=748)|
| 0:12:36| The density proposed is 5.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| Staff recommendation is to recommend that City Council approve RP-1 planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| at a density of up to 5.9 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| Applicant, would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| You'll go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Oh, they'll go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Opposition, there were several people that raised their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Do you have a spokesperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| All of you are, I understand, ma'am, you would like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| We have a couple speakers, so you have a total of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| So please allow time for all the people that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| I requested and was approved as the speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Sir, come up to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| And just as a point of interest for the Planning Commission meetings, we don't have registered speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| We just allow people to come up to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| We just give a total of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| And if you could just be respectful that there's other people that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| I am Bob Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| My address is 520 Prescott Way in Knoxville, and I represent Cleveland Park Condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| which are adjacent and just east of the property which John Moore proposes to rezone as RP1 planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=833)|
| 0:14:02| Cleveland Park has a vested interest in this rezoning request, as it would have a significant impact on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| If approved, rezoning would affect water drainage on our west side, traffic flow on Dean Hill, and the quality of life of our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=849)|
| 0:14:19| Cleveland Park is opposed to the rezoning for each of these reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| We believe strongly that construction would make worse an already bad water drainage problem that currently exists on land between Cleveland Park and the proposed road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=863)|
| 0:14:34| As a bit of background, Cleveland Park Condos were built on a hill that slopes downward from Dean Hill, which is high and flows south towards the tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=874)|
| 0:14:44| Storm water comes from above Dean Hill, goes through a tile that's under Dean Hill, and drains onto our west side and then pools behind our west side units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=884)|
| 0:14:56| and also onto the property that's being considered for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| The boundary between the two properties is not marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| It's a grassy area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| It's green undergrowth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| It's also tall trees, which give Cleveland Park residents a pleasant natural boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| Now, if approved, the resulting condo construction and road would make the drainage problem worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| It would also eliminate part of the natural boundary that our residents now have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| Our residents are used to looking out on a sea of green trees and shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| They would now see the front of condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| They would be subjected to traffic noise that they've not had before, and this would not be good quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| So thus, we're opposed to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| We also oppose rezoning because it will increase already heavy traffic flow on Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| More residential units mean more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| More people mean more cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| More cars mean more traffic flow onto Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| Dean Hill is narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| It's become a speedway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| It needs reduced speed limits and a signal light midway to flow traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| It does not need more residential units dumping more cars onto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| As dangerous as it is, in fact, on Thanksgiving weekend, a woman was killed just this past Thanksgiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=972)|
| 0:16:22| as her car crashed into our front entrance wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| And we'll have more about that and an accident that happened just this morning right outside our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| We oppose zoning based on increased traffic flow into Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| But should the Planning Commission approve the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| we then request that the developer is required to implement improvements that are important to both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1001)|
| 0:16:49| namely stormwater runoff from above Dean Hill, which affects both properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| and the elimination and replacement of a natural landscape barrier between the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| to enhance the value of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Let me turn it over very quickly to Cleveland Park resident Kay Munger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| who can talk about that traffic accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Kay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| I'm Kay Munger, 501 Prescott Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| A few nights before Thanksgiving last year, a woman died in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| Her car smashed through the brick wall that runs beside my condo, and she was killed instantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| Had the wall not been there, her car surely would have crashed inside my condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| A few years ago, another vehicle overturned beyond a wall into the yard of my neighbor across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| Just this morning, another accident occurred on Dean Hill and Cheshire Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| with a woman being taken away in an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| The police report listed speed as a factor in this fatal Thanksgiving accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| Dean Hill Road often sounds like a speedway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| If more condos are built, more vehicles will enter this speedway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| This is why we oppose this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| There's two more speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| I know we're running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Nancy Wilfaro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| I live at 7014 Brickton Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| This is the Glen Ives subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| That's two doors down from this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| We have sent, as Glen Ives, I'm the secretary-treasurer of that association, and we've sent a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| We hope that you'll enter that into the record as part of today's proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| We would like to see, so I'm not going to go over that because, obviously, Dean Hill, in the three years we've lived there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| has increased significantly in traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| We would like to see, and I don't know if it's appropriate to really ask the MPC commissioners for a traffic study on Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| We're trying to get information about when the last traffic study was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| We did not see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| We think it was 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Any of you who have been on Dean Hill Drive know how much more traffic is on there, and it has become dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| Going in and out of our subdivision is very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| I thought that people from the Dean Hill Alliance and the Dean Hill Neighborhood Association would be here today, but I do not see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| But I hope you'll take our request into consideration, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| I'd like to hear from Mr. Williams a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| Indeed, was there a traffic study done in 2009?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| What is the current speed limit on Dean Hill, and could you address some of the water issues that were raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1170)|
| 0:19:40| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| I'm not exactly sure when the last study was done out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| When there was a study done, it was most likely related to an adjacent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| That would typically require a traffic impact study if it meets a certain threshold in traffic generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1192)|
| 0:20:01| So I don't know when the last one was that was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| I can't remember what the speeds are right offhand on 40 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| That's what I was thinking that they were based on what I could recall but hadn't looked recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| As far as looking at speeds and looking at traffic improvements, that's something that citizens would reach out to our traffic department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1218)|
| 0:20:28| and they could evaluate the road and see if there's things that the city could do to make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| As far as the development, I guess we're talking about a rezoning here, so I've not seen a development plan for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| And so I don't know what type of development it is or how many units are going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| I don't know what thresholds it would reach from that particular respect as far as traffic goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| But if it does trigger certain thresholds, then there may be traffic studies related to the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1251)|
| 0:20:59| As far as stormwater goes, as Mr. Baker said, the property generally flows south from Dean Hill down to the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1259)|
| 0:21:07| It looks like the property pretty much has the ability to drain the water down to the railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| which is essentially what the city would allow as far as they would have to look as far as a downstream study goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| as long as they got it to the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Just looking at the topography maps, it does look like there is, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| some type of swell or something that goes down the west side of Cleveland Park condos, as Mr. Baker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| And it does look like a pipe outlets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| So when the property develops, if that pipe is on the development property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| there may be things that they have to do to address the run-on from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| And Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| With regard to a traffic study, this site is about less than three acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| and they're asking for less than six units an acre, which we put at about 14 or 15 units maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| That's far below the threshold for which we would require, according to our administrative policies and procedures, a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| So no traffic study would be required as a result of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| I'd reiterate what Mr. Williams said, that the neighborhoods should get with the city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| and work collectively to address traffic issues and speeding on Dean Hill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Sir, would you like to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| John Moore, 540 Stone Pony Lane, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| The site plan has changed to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| The city traffic engineers want us to line up the road with Chestire Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| Therefore, it eliminated the first two condos, so it's now 12, so we're basically at 4.2 per acre now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| The first condo is starting like 75 feet off of Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1378)|
| 0:23:07| And are you aware of what Mr. Williams was talking about with the drainage ditch that separates the properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1387)|
| 0:23:16| Is that something that you're taking into consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| And I met with Bob, who just spoke a minute ago, yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| and I told him that I would obviously work with him when we're developing the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| to address any drainage issues that benefit both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| And just as a note, this plan would be a planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| and the plans for the project would come back through the planning staff and planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| Planning staff would work with city engineering and other city staff to ensure that all those issues are addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| and the planning commission in their review could double-check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Wonderful. Thank you. Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| I was going to say this does have to come back. This is just a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| We get a development plan back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| Mr. Baker brought up that there's a drainage problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| They'll have to meet city engineering regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| and we'll have to review a development plan which should require some vegetative planning and screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1452)|
| 0:24:21| So I'd like to make a motion that we recommend that city council approve RP1 planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| at a density of up to 5.9 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy and a second by Commissioner Smith to approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| I don't see any other lights on. All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Any opposed? The motion carries. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| And I'm sure that the city engineering is going to be looking forward to hearing from the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| Next on our agenda is item number 28, and Commissioner Smith is recusing from discussion and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1495)|
| 0:25:08| Take some vegetables with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| The applicant is RML Construction, LLP Ryan M. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| The location is the east intersection between Solway Road and Sam Lee Road adjacent to Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1520)|
| 0:25:28| The approximate size of the tract is 32.49 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| Present zoning is BP Business and Technology, TO Technology Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| The zoning requested is OB, Office Medical and Related Services, TO Technology Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| The existing land use is agriculture, forestry, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| The proposed use is uses allowed for in the OB, TO zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| The staff recommendation is to recommend that the County Commission approve OB, Office Medical and Related Services zoning subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1558)|
| 0:26:08| Is the applicant present? We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| Is there opposition? There is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Okay. Sir, would you like to go first or the comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| We'll defer to the comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Ma'am, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Hey, I'm Dawn Walsh. I'm at 4721 Gwen Road in Knoxville, 37931, and I'm here on behalf of Hardin Valley Planning Advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1590)|
| 0:26:39| Kim couldn't be here today, so I am her less qualified stand-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| We just wanted to thank Ryan. He met with us a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| We talked about this, and we just wanted to thank him for doing that and also just to reiterate that apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| if that is potentially in the future, that is not a good use for this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| and that we ask him if he would please add some community services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| some things that would add benefit to the community, such as a bike trail, a walking trail, a dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| Condos would be great. Mixed use would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| We would love to have a little bit more commerce and retail, more coffee shops, things of that nature, but definitely not more apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1632)|
| 0:27:21| As far as the density, the school, the effect on the schools, and then, of course, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| Okay, that's all. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| Ben Mullins. I'm at France McClellan Seymour, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| We represent the applicant. I also have Buddy Goodwin and Ryan Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| They may have some comments as well on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| I had sent a letter out to the commissioners yesterday just kind of outlining our perspective on this from a legal standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1671)|
| 0:28:01| with regard to the condition that's requested that this be subject to a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| Has everyone had an opportunity to review the letter that I provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| I have extra copies if not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| The recommendation is almost verbatim to the recommendation of other parcels in the immediate area that were rezoned from BPTO to OBTO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1695)|
| 0:28:29| with the exception that those parcels in 2015 were not subject to that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| The current zoning for the OB allows, as a use permitted, as opposed to uses permitted on review, any use within the RB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1715)|
| 0:28:47| The RB zone allows, as a use permitted, as opposed to uses permitted on review, multi-dwelling structures up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1727)|
| 0:28:58| It goes beyond 12 dwelling units per acre. The ordinance, as it is currently written, does require use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| Our application, I don't think the final plans have been made as to what's going to be used on the property, so we do appreciate the comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1746)|
| 0:29:16| Any uses permitted within the RB zone, specifically those under 5.1 to 5.2, A through O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1756)|
| 0:29:30| We're not asking for anything that is already subject to use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| We believe that subjecting us to a use on review is not enforceable and is actually an extra condition that would exceed the existing zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1774)|
| 0:29:47| All we're asking is that we follow the existing zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| I understand there's a difference of opinion on that, and ultimately we can go on further and have more conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1790)|
| 0:29:58| We have already gotten approval from the Technology Corridor Association, which we agreed to, because traffic was one of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1798)|
| 0:30:07| We understand that the topography on that property is also a concern, and that is something that there's going to have to be more conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| when we work with the engineering department as far as grading and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| Those things can be addressed at that point, but we would like to avoid the added expense and uncertainty of the use on review process, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1820)|
| 0:30:29| The current zoning ordinance doesn't provide for it, and we don't think it's appropriate in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| I think Mr. Goodwin, do you want to have any further comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| Well, I think Buddy Goodwin, General Counsel for the applicant in 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, Knoxville, Ryan Hickey, who you all know is here with us as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1840)|
| 0:30:49| and he can answer probably a lot more questions than I can locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| Noah, I thank you, Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| You all don't hear from me much. That's probably good. You don't have to hear me bellow on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| Part of the reason is, one, we've got good people like Ben, and you've seen Arthur Seymour here on our behalf, and I'm a zoning neophyte when it comes to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| But I think the other reason is, and since you don't see me much, I'll take the time to thank you and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| is that this is, of the areas that I deal in, this is a very efficient one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| You guys do a good job of putting out rules and adhering to them and creating what business people like us and, I think, quite frankly, everybody needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1877)|
| 0:31:26| which is, in situations like this, as much kind of certainty and an ability to proceed as you can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| And I think that's what made me think of that was, one, I wanted to thank you for it, because I do like the fact that it provides us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| And then I just think it's applicable here. I've seen the issues that have been brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| I think the zoning ordinance is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I was at a hearing the other night when a lot of these items that are a little more property-specific were discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| and it just, I mean, I was hearing the arguments, and I think the fact of the matter is that that discussion's been had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1912)|
| 0:32:00| The ordinance provides that you have permitted uses and you have ones that require the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| and there's no real reason to go against that public policy that's already been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| Any of these issues that I've heard, we certainly work those out with engineering, things like slope, things like traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| We do that all the time, and we certainly, the feedback I get is we do a good job and the people are happy with what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| So I want to give you the assurance that we'll do that, and we just ask you to do what you've always done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| which is hear the zoning, hear the fact that I think I hope you're going to hear that it's in line with all the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| it's in line with all the zones, it's in line with everything that a zoning should get approved for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| and you would give us approval and follow the ordinance like you expect us to do, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| And I'd like to hear from Ms. Green with regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| With regard to some of the comments about the condition that's been recommended by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| I heard that adhere to the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Well, the current zoning is BP, and so what we're reviewing is a change in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| We're adding the condition to carry on some of the standards there in the existing zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| to ensure that the steep slope is addressed carefully, which they have committed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=1998)|
| 0:33:26| to ensure that the provision of a greenway easement as proposed or requested by the Knox County Parks and Recreation is provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2006)|
| 0:33:38| to allow for that additional review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| We're not adding anything that has not been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| I appreciate Mr. Mullen's concern that this might be outside our purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| but we've heard from our legal staff, the legal staff of Knox County and of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| that conditions are appropriate as long as they don't limit the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| We're not limiting the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| We're just asking that we be allowed the ability to review the plan to ensure that the needs of the community are met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2040)|
| 0:34:09| that there are certain environmental protections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| and that we can ensure that Mr. Hickey and his organization continue to do the good job in development that they have a track record for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2051)|
| 0:34:20| We don't want to slow this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| We understand the challenge of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| We allow the use of review plans and applications to be submitted prior to the review of this rezoning request by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2066)|
| 0:34:37| We are cognizant of the timing element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| We're just, again, asking that the provision for plan review that's in the existing zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| and would be in the planned residential zone if they went to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| just be followed through to allow an additional review of the plans themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| We do adhere to the rules, and I don't think we've ever denied a use on review in this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2094)|
| 0:35:04| We would be cognizant of our commitment to the community and to the development in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Commissioner Clancy, you've got your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| We did have a couple other lights on, but we also have another light on, so I hope you're not going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| First of all, I'd like to say Mr. Goodwin, I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2123)|
| 0:35:32| One of the reasons that we are so efficient here as a planning body is that we have people like Mr. Hickey that are here every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2132)|
| 0:35:41| and other developers like him that work with the neighborhoods, communicate with the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| and try their best to do quality developments for the city and county of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| And I don't know what your all's relationship is, but he's a very, very good developer here in Knoxville and very well respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2153)|
| 0:36:01| That's one of the reasons we are this efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| That being said, this use on review, this is a significant piece of property in our technology corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| and it's not that we think you're going to ramrod a bunch of apartments in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| but I think that the neighbors and the neighborhoods would appreciate a final say, something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| And there's no reason to doubt that you all aren't going to do a really nice development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| but we'd like to see it just because it's this piece of property, not because of anything you all do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| and not because we don't trust you, but this piece of property is pretty significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| and I think it would help the neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| So I'm going to make a motion that we recommend that county commission approve OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| office medical and related services zoning, subject to the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Eason to approve with the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2216)|
| 0:37:03| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| And Commissioner Smith can come back in so that he can adjourn the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| Thirty-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| Do I hear that we have nothing else on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| Thirty-seven, go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| And do we have a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| Oh, Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Mr. Green has a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| I did talk to Mr. Mullins prior to the meeting for an update on Arthur Seymour's health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2259)|
| 0:37:48| because we've all, as I've told Mr. Mullins, we've all been thinking and praying for Arthur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| so I appreciate you passing on how he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| He's doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| I spoke to him this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| He actually has turned his cell phone off, which is a very positive sign that he is taking getting better seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| There's been a lot of rumors and things about what really is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| He has a diagnosis of lung cancer in his upper lobe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| He is starting treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| It is a very conservative treatment, which is, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| an indication that it's something that they think they can treat well and easily without it being too harsh on him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| and that he has a very good prognosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| I wouldn't be surprised if I would see him back here soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| So that's the hope, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| I don't like being filling in for him as inably as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| We have a motion to adjourn, a second by Commissioner Roth, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Sir, did you have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| My name is Peter Love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| I live at 2677 Truman Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| I was here about Item 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| It's my first time being to one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| I didn't understand that I needed to be in the very beginning of the meeting about the rezoning from low-density residential to general residential on Richmond Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2354)|
| 0:39:25| And that item was heard on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| It's marked with an asterisk, and I read it in the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| And so because there was not any opposition in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| I missed it just as I walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| I think you were finishing up, and I didn't understand to come down and be here to say I needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| And I am so sorry for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| That one will be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Is that a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| It goes to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| We'd be happy to talk with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| What's your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Peter Love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| I'd be happy to talk with you right after a couple of minutes and fill you in on what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| And as Mr. Green said, it will go before City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| So make sure that you're at the meeting that this is going to be heard at City Council or talk to your City Council representative and let them know any concerns you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2410)|
| 0:40:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190214?start=2420)|
