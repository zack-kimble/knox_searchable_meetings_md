| 3:12:46| that we need to overturn the action of the Metropolitan Planning Commission commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11566)|
| 3:12:52| Right, and you used the word staff twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11572)|
| 3:12:55| The staff recommended approval with two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11575)|
| 3:13:01| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11581)|
| 3:13:04| So if we don't approve this appeal, does it go back to MPC or it's just done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11584)|
| 3:13:11| Thank you for the question, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11591)|
| 3:13:13| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11593)|
| 3:13:16| They can reapply for rezoning, but it has to be different than what they've applied for this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11596)|
| 3:13:25| before it comes back to commission within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11605)|
| 3:13:30| She asked the question of what vote count we have to have to take what action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11610)|
| 3:13:40| No, I was just wondering if we vote this down, does it go back to MPC or is it done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11620)|
| 3:13:50| There are several avenues forward for the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11630)|
| 3:13:55| For instance, on the current zoning classification, they could apply for use on review tomorrow if you deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11635)|
| 3:14:04| While I've got the microphone, I would like to say that this did come from MPC as a denied application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11644)|
| 3:14:11| You guys have ten members here, not a big issue, but when one comes from MPC as a denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11651)|
| 3:14:17| it requires a majority of the entire membership, which means six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11657)|
| 3:14:21| So if you had one less, you'd have to get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11661)|
| 3:14:26| It takes six votes to pass whatever we pass, regardless of whether Commissioner Busler is here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11666)|
| 3:14:34| or if there were two other people absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| I think one of the things that we're probably missing out of this is that's what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11677)|
| 3:14:43| at the Metropolitan Planning Commission is that their head count was not at full count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11683)|
| 3:14:50| and they had some people that may have voted this way or that way that were not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11690)|
| 3:14:55| So does that answer your question, Commissioner Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11699)|
| 3:15:00| I was just wondering what avenues were open to the applicant if we turn this appeal down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11700)|
| 3:15:12| I'm struck by the fact that our paid professional MPC staff approved this, and MPC turned it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11712)|
| 3:15:26| and it just all seems a bit unusual and kind of mixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11726)|
| 3:15:34| So I didn't know if there was another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11734)|
| 3:15:37| I've heard a lot of people talk about that this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11737)|
| 3:15:40| use on review has been mentioned a lot in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11740)|
| 3:15:44| So I'm just wondering what avenues were available to them if this is voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11744)|
| 3:15:50| So I think I understand that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11750)|
| 3:15:52| Although, John, did you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11752)|
| 3:15:57| Just a point of order, and Mr. Sanders is in discussion with a member of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11757)|
| 3:16:06| He can correct me, but no disrespect to any Commission member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11766)|
| 3:16:13| but the statement that on appeal you have to have overwhelming evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11773)|
| 3:16:23| I believe he said an overwhelming preponderance of the evidence in order to overturn an appeal from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11783)|
| 3:16:32| I believe your lawyer will probably tell you that that is not the standard of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11792)|
| 3:16:40| I do not want anybody voting on this Commission on the belief that there has to be overwhelming preponderance of the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11800)|
| 3:16:49| to change whatever it is that MPC did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| When it's appealed from MPC, it comes here de novo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11812)|
| 3:16:57| Am I right, Mr. Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| Yes, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11819)|
| 3:17:00| De novo means the whole thing starts, in essence, all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11820)|
| 3:17:05| It's the same quantum of proof that it took for them to take action in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11825)|
| 3:17:11| that is required of you to take action on this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11831)|
| 3:17:14| There is no requirement for overwhelming preponderance of the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11834)|
| 3:17:19| And I think you would say, then what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11839)|
| 3:17:22| A simple preponderance, however slight, but a simple preponderance of the evidence is sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11842)|
| 3:17:31| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11851)|
| 3:17:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11853)|
| 3:17:37| Mr. Kelly, I don't know how to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11857)|
| 3:17:44| You know, sometimes in a discussion a statement can be made that sways votes tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11864)|
| 3:17:55| But was there a statement made by a member of MPC that they had driven by and it just didn't look good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11875)|
| 3:18:04| Yes, there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11884)|
| 3:18:05| The comment was it looked like a strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11885)|
| 3:18:11| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| Is it in the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11893)|
| 3:18:14| Does it say that in the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11894)|
| 3:18:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11895)|
| 3:18:19| Well, my point is that sometimes we do get swayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11899)|
| 3:18:24| You may be on the fence about something, but if Brad's my friend and he goes by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11904)|
| 3:18:29| I didn't get a chance to go by, but he goes by and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11909)|
| 3:18:32| Mike, it looks like a pile of crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| I'm not going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11914)|
| 3:18:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11923)|
| 3:18:44| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11924)|
| 3:18:45| You're not Mr. Brown yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11925)|
| 3:18:46| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11926)|
| 3:18:47| Commissioner McKenzie, you had your line on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11927)|
| 3:18:52| Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11932)|
| 3:18:57| There were three brand new commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| It was their first service at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11940)|
| 3:19:05| And I remember about the first thing said was said by MPC chairman, Mrs. Longmire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11945)|
| 3:19:13| and her comment that you asked about was something generally to the effect that she had been by there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11953)|
| 3:19:20| and it wasn't very pretty, the existing site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11960)|
| 3:19:26| It wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11966)|
| 3:19:27| I believe I'm close to Quintner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11967)|
| 3:19:30| It wasn't very pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11970)|
| 3:19:33| And I acknowledge to her that she was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11973)|
| 3:19:36| You know, a mulching site that has been put in and still got grading going on on that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11976)|
| 3:19:43| probably not very pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| But it is in an industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| It is by nature an industrial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11990)|
| 3:19:53| That's the reason you're required in this county to have, if you're going to have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11993)|
| 3:19:58| it has to be in a CB zone or on a planned commercial track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=11998)|
| 3:20:10| I mean, if you look at Claiborne Hauling, they've done a lot of work at their site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12010)|
| 3:20:15| which is just right down the road from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12015)|
| 3:20:18| And I suspect Mrs. Longmire would say that's not very pretty either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12018)|
| 3:20:24| And I don't undertake to argue that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12024)|
| 3:20:29| That's what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12029)|
| 3:20:32| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| Yes, in regard to what Commissioner Boyle said about being conflicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12034)|
| 3:20:39| because of the staff making one recommendation and the planning commission making another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12039)|
| 3:20:47| I will never sit down here and say that the planning commission in doing their duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12047)|
| 3:20:53| did something wrong in the sense that that's what they're appointed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12053)|
| 3:20:58| They are there to listen to all sides of the argument, the argument presented by staff, citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12058)|
| 3:21:05| the applicants, whoever, and they make a decision and make a recommendation to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12065)|
| 3:21:10| And that's what you have is the recommendation of 15 citizens who are, in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12070)|
| 3:21:15| 14 citizens who were appointed by the layers to hear these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12075)|
| 3:21:24| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12084)|
| 3:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12085)|
| 3:21:26| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12086)|
| 3:21:27| What was the vote on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12087)|
| 3:21:30| Two to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12090)|
| 3:21:31| It was nine to four to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12091)|
| 3:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| You know, and I guess I'll say, you know, I may not be as adamant as Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12094)|
| 3:21:43| but I do agree with him in that that's a body, that's a part of governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12103)|
| 3:21:48| And that's, you know, they're a specialized body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12108)|
| 3:21:52| So to say that, and I'm not saying anyone's saying this, so please don't take me wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12112)|
| 3:21:57| I do listen to them with a pretty objective ear because I expect them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12117)|
| 3:22:05| whether it's meeting one or meeting five, I mean, if I'm at meeting one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12125)|
| 3:22:11| I'm really not going to let a planning commissioner sway me on it doesn't look pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12131)|
| 3:22:20| So I think that got kind of petty as we went back and forth and called folks' names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12140)|
| 3:22:25| I'd say she didn't think it looked pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12145)|
| 3:22:28| But the body itself, you know, I do give them weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12148)|
| 3:22:34| And so I'm just speaking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| Whether you vote up, down, left, or right, I don't think it's outlandish of someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12156)|
| 3:22:44| including myself, to say, you know, MPC means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12164)|
| 3:22:47| They've always meant something during my eight and a half years here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12167)|
| 3:22:50| I hadn't always agreed with them, but I value what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12170)|
| 3:22:54| There are several of you all that sat on MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12174)|
| 3:22:56| and I think you all feel that your work was a good body of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12176)|
| 3:23:00| So for us to kind of sit here and imply that they can be swayed with one statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12180)|
| 3:23:09| I mean, that's a pretty serious commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| So that, to me, wasn't really germane to what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12192)|
| 3:23:18| But I do value what MPC brings to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12198)|
| 3:23:22| And generally we agree, so we must feel that way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12202)|
| 3:23:28| Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12208)|
| 3:23:35| I want to make myself clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12215)|
| 3:23:38| I think most of you know that I've been around even a short period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12218)|
| 3:23:43| that I have to deal with MPC staff, I have to deal with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12223)|
| 3:23:49| I'm not impugning their integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12229)|
| 3:23:51| They're part of the process, and they're an important part of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12231)|
| 3:23:54| and I don't have any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12234)|
| 3:23:57| But they're just like staff on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12237)|
| 3:24:00| I'm going to disagree with staff on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12240)|
| 3:24:02| I'm going to disagree with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12242)|
| 3:24:05| And you all have the right to do that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12245)|
| 3:24:10| And there's no magic about what MPC says or what staff says as far as you all are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12250)|
| 3:24:21| because you're the ultimate arbiter by virtue of your zoning decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12261)|
| 3:24:26| Up until then, we're following a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| And in this instance, I spent a lot of time with the staff on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12269)|
| 3:24:34| We looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12274)|
| 3:24:35| We dealt with the hillside rigs, the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12275)|
| 3:24:39| We put a line on there that accommodated the interest of the residents to our west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12279)|
| 3:24:47| And we drew a line and said, okay, south of that line, it's going to be CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12287)|
| 3:24:53| and north of that line, it's going to be left planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12293)|
| 3:24:57| That's the way we came to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12297)|
| 3:25:00| That's the way staff ended up recommending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12300)|
| 3:25:03| I did not agree with condition number two about eliminating an access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12303)|
| 3:25:09| I felt that the traffic flow justified the two means of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12309)|
| 3:25:14| And, you know, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12314)|
| 3:25:18| MPC does what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12318)|
| 3:25:22| It sometimes agrees with staff, and sometimes it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12322)|
| 3:25:26| In this instance, this is one where they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12326)|
| 3:25:28| Now I disagree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12328)|
| 3:25:30| It's up to you all to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12330)|
| 3:25:32| I hope I've been able to present as much information as necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12332)|
| 3:25:36| to justify the action of this body to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12336)|
| 3:25:41| because what we propose and how we propose to do it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12341)|
| 3:25:53| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12353)|
| 3:25:57| As I look at the proposal, what's before us, I cannot agree with a yes and a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12357)|
| 3:26:07| The staff has brought forward that there are certain aspects of this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12367)|
| 3:26:17| which they agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12377)|
| 3:26:20| The body politic, the MPC commissioners have disagreed with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12380)|
| 3:26:27| So by whatever motion I make, I cannot agree with both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12387)|
| 3:26:35| The conditions that are applied to this, like do not enter into above line 1040,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12395)|
| 3:26:49| that's a good line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12409)|
| 3:26:52| The trying to have a right turn into the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12412)|
| 3:26:56| and come out of the property a different place, one way in, one way out, is a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12416)|
| 3:27:01| But saying 70% of the traffic comes from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12421)|
| 3:27:07| it means that everyone comes up to the immediate cut that's at the far right hand of our picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12427)|
| 3:27:13| and turns left into what is the existing property, which is zoned CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12433)|
| 3:27:22| And I believe that primarily to be where the truck traffic is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12442)|
| 3:27:27| The location that is on the new property, as I've heard the testimony and read the notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12447)|
| 3:27:34| is to be the property which is to be utilized as a retail sales property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12454)|
| 3:27:41| and would have people maybe in large trucks, but maybe more frequently in smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12461)|
| 3:27:50| I'll categorize it as one ton trucks as opposed to the larger vehicles carrying incoming product from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12470)|
| 3:28:03| That backs me up to something that I know on the city council meeting just recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12483)|
| 3:28:08| there's a new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12488)|
| 3:28:11| This location is expanding because of a new contract with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12491)|
| 3:28:16| and will be receiving more waste at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12496)|
| 3:28:20| But that traffic will only be going up to the entrance, the last median cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12500)|
| 3:28:27| and going into where the tub grinder is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12507)|
| 3:28:35| The condition that there be landscaping, this is just my comment, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12515)|
| 3:28:46| I believe that was a trip wire with MPC, the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12526)|
| 3:28:54| It's difficult when real estate runs away from the viewing four-lane highway and goes uphill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12534)|
| 3:29:03| It means that everything you've got back there is at varying levels more and more observable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12543)|
| 3:29:14| And that if it looks bad, it looks bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12554)|
| 3:29:17| And if you're going to go next door and have more CB, it's going to look bad too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12557)|
| 3:29:23| So the admonishment here has got to be for me that you've got to make the place look better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12563)|
| 3:29:29| because you agreed to it in the beginning and this new place needs to look better as it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12569)|
| 3:29:40| When we talk about these cuts, these entrances and exits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12580)|
| 3:29:48| as I'm trying to hear what Commissioner Anders has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12588)|
| 3:29:51| and what my belief is is that those are either approved or disapproved by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12591)|
| 3:29:59| This is a state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| I believe that I notice out through there there are signs that say highway cuts in and out are to control the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12601)|
| 3:30:10| And it doesn't matter whether it's permitted or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12610)|
| 3:30:13| It's at the control of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12613)|
| 3:30:18| And then I also think I hear that there are other adjacent and available properties here, there, and yonder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12618)|
| 3:30:26| that are of the same zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12626)|
| 3:30:34| The applicant asking for CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12634)|
| 3:30:46| And then I've left something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12646)|
| 3:30:48| This piece of property between the existing property and the new piece of property, there is no reasonable expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12648)|
| 3:31:00| It's going to be a tough deal to get an interior road between those two parcels of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12660)|
| 3:31:14| We may be going in the wrong direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12674)|
| 3:31:19| but I'm going to put it in the form of a motion that the rezoning to CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12679)|
| 3:31:39| which is what's requested, that it be rezoned to CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12699)|
| 3:31:44| Am I stating that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12704)|
| 3:31:47| The request is to rezone to CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12707)|
| 3:31:54| That it be permitted with the conditions that you do not get above the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12714)|
| 3:32:04| Well, 1040, let me call it the elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12724)|
| 3:32:08| Is that an elevation line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12728)|
| 3:32:11| It's a distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12731)|
| 3:32:13| Is it a distance or an elevation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12733)|
| 3:32:15| It looks like elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12735)|
| 3:32:16| I think elevation, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12736)|
| 3:32:20| That there be no encroachment upon real estate above the line marked 1040.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12740)|
| 3:32:31| Would it be easier to say staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12751)|
| 3:32:34| It would be easier to say if your motion is to overturn MPC and to approve CB zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12754)|
| 3:32:45| the better thing to do would be for the area south of the diagonal line marked by the staff that's in your material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12765)|
| 3:33:01| It's referred to CB zoning south of the green dashed line only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12781)|
| 3:33:08| but there's an actual drawing in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12788)|
| 3:33:19| There may be a very small portion of it that might be above the 1040 on the far right-hand upper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12799)|
| 3:33:29| The northeastern corner up there, I can't tell from the map that's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12809)|
| 3:33:37| I see the little triangle that you're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12817)|
| 3:33:39| but let's say that the 1040 line designates no further development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12819)|
| 3:33:56| I think we've got some confusion about a 1040 line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12836)|
| 3:34:04| John, I think on the drawing that you submitted that you handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12844)|
| 3:34:15| I think the dark orange or red line that you identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12855)|
| 3:34:20| it also intersects with the 1040 contour line toward the top of the page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12860)|
| 3:34:27| Well, it does at that point, but I'm not sure about maybe up above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12867)|
| 3:34:35| I don't know where the 1040 contour line goes after it hits that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12875)|
| 3:34:38| but I think we're talking about the red line that goes diagonally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12878)|
| 3:34:49| There's two arrows on each side of it, one on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12889)|
| 3:34:53| And that's it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12893)|
| 3:34:58| Yeah, but it's from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12898)|
| 3:35:04| This line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12904)|
| 3:35:07| Just call it the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12907)|
| 3:35:10| I like the green line better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12910)|
| 3:35:15| I would say, Commissioner, to avoid any problem or confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12915)|
| 3:35:30| if you take the document that I handed out, Dan, you've got a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12930)|
| 3:35:37| If you used the heavy orange line that goes diagonally across the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12937)|
| 3:35:45| and just said there would be the rezoning to CB would be the area south of that orange line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12945)|
| 3:35:55| And in the staff recommendation, the zoning line is a green dash line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12955)|
| 3:36:01| that goes from the jag, as you called it a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12961)|
| 3:36:05| straight to the corner of the northeast corner of the parcel that's under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12965)|
| 3:36:15| I now have what Mr. Kelly has handed up, and it's the one that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12975)|
| 3:36:21| staff recommended zoning line CB zoning south of the green dash line only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12981)|
| 3:36:26| I've got that, and that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12986)|
| 3:36:29| That's what we agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12989)|
| 3:36:37| So the motion is to approve the rezoning as recommended by the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=12997)|
| 3:36:56| With one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13016)|
| 3:37:01| Condition number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13021)|
| 3:37:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13023)|
| 3:37:05| So you're eliminating number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13025)|
| 3:37:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13031)|
| 3:37:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13032)|
| 3:37:13| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| Who's taking the second here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13037)|
| 3:37:18| It's her last vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13038)|
| 3:37:21| When do I ever move or second anything in zoning meetings, frankly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13041)|
| 3:37:27| Yes, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| So your motion is to approve it per MPC staff's recommendation, but instead of both conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13049)|
| 3:37:37| only one condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13057)|
| 3:37:39| The first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13059)|
| 3:37:40| The first condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13060)|
| 3:37:42| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13062)|
| 3:37:43| Yes, I would like to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13063)|
| 3:37:48| The applicant will be using the entrance and exit that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13068)|
| 3:37:56| What's the condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13076)|
| 3:37:58| Landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13078)|
| 3:38:02| And it's landscaping on both parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13082)|
| 3:38:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13086)|
| 3:38:07| You can look down if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13087)|
| 3:38:12| Commissioner Oenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13092)|
| 3:38:15| Just a clarification, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13095)|
| 3:38:17| Is this, since it's an appeal of the denial, so by doing this motion, we'll be voting yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13097)|
| 3:38:32| If we agree with your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13112)|
| 3:38:34| Voting to overturn the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13114)|
| 3:38:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13117)|
| 3:38:38| I want to get my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13118)|
| 3:38:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13120)|
| 3:38:42| And it takes six affirmative votes to do what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13122)|
| 3:38:47| Not the majority of the body here present, but six affirmative votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13127)|
| 3:39:02| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13142)|
| 3:39:04| Can we start in the ninth since it's his last vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13144)|
| 3:39:06| Or the eighth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13146)|
| 3:39:07| Or the ninth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13147)|
| 3:39:08| It's in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13148)|
| 3:39:10| So an aye means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13150)|
| 3:39:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13154)|
| 3:39:15| An aye approves the recommendation of staff, which is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160822?start=13155)|
