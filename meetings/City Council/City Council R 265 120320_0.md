| 0:02:28| Okay, for the mayor's report, we just finished two days of the mayor's budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| and I think those went very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Several city council members were able to attend, and we appreciate them being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| The last day of our budget hearings will be on Monday, March 26, at 1 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| and it's on the fourth floor. Is that 453? Thank you. Room 453.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| Of course, that is a public meeting. Anybody is welcome to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| And I also, council should have received an invitation from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| Actually, I'm not sure if this is Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| I think this is in your district, the Lonsdale Recreation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| And the city is going to expand the Lonsdale Recreation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| That's a project that's been in the works for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| The city and KCDC are funding that, and so instead of a ground breaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| we're having a wall breaking, where apparently I get to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| maybe some others get to punch out a wall with a sledgehammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| So that will be exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| That's Wednesday, March 28, at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| So I hope you all will be there if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| And I guess you're going to talk about the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Okay, that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| And now reports of council. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| I have two items to report on this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| First off is the council will be holding a workshop in this room on March the 29th, beginning at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=243)|
| 0:04:12| And that will be the Department of Community Development's annual report to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| So everyone's invited to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| And then I would like to announce that I'll be having my quarterly coffee with the councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| That's March the 31st at the world-famous Roundup Restaurant in South Knoxville at 9 o'clock to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| So I invite everyone to come visit and chat about goings-on with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=274)|
| 0:04:42| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| I want to make note of an event that is taking place in the 6th District on this Friday at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| Mount Olive Baptist Church on Danridge Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| The Tennessee State University debate team has been invited to come, and I want to invite everybody to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=296)|
| 0:05:05| Admission is free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| And if any of you saw the movie a few years back, The Great Debaters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| you might enjoy coming and seeing and supporting these young people from my alma mater, Tennessee State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Chairman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| This Saturday from 10 to 2 at the Walgreens on Clinton Highway in Merchant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| and Walgreens at Chapman and Green Road is an unwanted medication collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| And we live in a time where unwanted medication can have a premium street value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| Isn't that right, Chief Roush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| And so if you have some unwanted medications, whether they have a good street value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| or you just don't need them anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| please consider going to one of those two locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| The drugs are disposed of properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| And if you can't make those two locations, the Walgreens at Clinton Highway in Merchant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| the Walgreens at Chapman and Green Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| then you can go to the safety building anytime on Howard Baker Avenue, and they have a receptacle there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| Councilman Della Velpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Yeah, let me just footnote what Brenda said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| It's important to realize that you shouldn't be flushing this kind of stuff down the toilet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| because it gets in the water supply, it gets in the river, it hurts the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| So disposing of it soundly like that is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| Appreciate you bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Thank you, Mayor Harrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| Two quick notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| Last time I had mentioned something about changing about the elections of at-large candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| I would like to put that off for right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| and perhaps we can talk about it a little bit at our next dinner, which is on April the 3rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| in addition to the tree-cutting clearing practices of our large utility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=411)|
| 0:06:59| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| Okay, Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules to move Item 11A, to have that done immediately, if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| That's the resolution to honor the memory of Ace Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| Okay, we have a motion and a second to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| I just want to say a few words before I read the resolution to the Ace Miller family who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| and when we finish the resolution, we'd certainly like for you folks to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Miller during my campaign two and a half years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| and we had several lunches together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| and I want the family to know how much I appreciate the work that he did for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| and his insight into Knoxville, and I really did appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| I also wanted to mention that to the family, what a tribute to your husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| and to your father and brother at the services the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| It was a tremendous crowd, and it was a tremendous event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| And so I just wanted to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| But I would like to read the resolution, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=495)|

| 0:11:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=693)|
| 0:11:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| I take that as a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Okay, I would presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| Well, I just, you know, want to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| I mean, Ace and their family, extended family, have been friends of my family for I don't know how many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| a long time, and, you know, the thing about Ace, there's a lot of things about Ace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| but I can remember him coming in our food warehouse and being there for an hour or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| forever, bought anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| He wanted to talk and tell you about a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| And it was always a pleasure to have him in there and just really brighten the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| Always brightened the room, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| And when he walked in, he took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| And I guarantee you he's taken over in a different place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| But, you know, we talked about a lot of different great boxers there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| but it was really about the ones that you didn't hear about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| the lives that he probably saved and changed, or not probably, but did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| And that worked there when I noticed he wasn't in the headlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| but that was the real work that he did for this city and for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| And I never knew anybody that loved, you know, his city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| He was probably one of the best ambassadors that we ever had in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| And he just truly loved his family and loved this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| I didn't know if the family might want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| I don't know if anyone you're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| You're not required to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| But if anyone would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| And just from all of the city, I've heard so many stories about Ace Miller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| and about his accomplishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| and just want you to know that we all appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| and appreciate all that he's done for this city and for our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| And we're really pleased to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| This is just a small token, obviously, as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| But his legacy will live on for many, many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=861)|

| 0:14:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=879)|

| 0:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Councilman Grieve, did you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=899)|
| 0:15:07| I had left a message earlier that possibly just a clarification of the one item that we've already gone through very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=907)|
| 0:15:17| which had to do with your reorganization in terms of maybe just on the record to explain to the people what has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| between the 10-year plan and South Knoxville in terms of the budget changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| You're talking about 9B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| I missed 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| I think it's in 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| 9B are the budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| Jim York is prepared to address what he thinks your question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Jim, I left you a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Jim York, finance director for the City of Knoxville, foreigner, Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| In reference, what you have before you is a budget amendment that has basically five components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| Most of them are housekeeping in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| One of them is a reappropriation of prior year encumbrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| We have a couple of appropriations that last at the end of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| one for feasibility study of a bridge at World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| and the other were for a couple of public service trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| and we are reappropriating those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| We have one program, the senior aid program, which has experienced a cut in federal funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| and we are just basically amending the budget to bring that to reflect reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| We have some additional depreciation that we're budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| We also have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| We received one gift of $5,000, and we're appropriating those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| Specifically, you ask about the mayor's reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| We have, as part of this budget, reshifted funds from South Waterfront and from inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1012)|
| 0:17:02| and it shows in the transfer line item as well as the item formerly budgeted under South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1022)|
| 0:17:11| We have shifted funds to administration and to engineering to reflect the reorganization that was done by Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1031)|
| 0:17:22| The net cost of that is zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| So, basically, it's just a shifting of funds, and there are no additional dollars involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| Hopefully that takes care of your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| You answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1052)|

| 0:21:50| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| I just wanted a little more information on that, exactly why it's like a round number and three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| and what if you don't use it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| I mean, can you give a little bit of background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Please state your name so everyone knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| I'm Jim Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| I'm an engineering director for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| The background is that the process, any right-of-way project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| most of the projects that the city does are required to secure the right-of-way to do the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1338)|
| 0:22:31| and there's a lot of expense both in negotiation and background research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1351)|
| 0:22:40| Because the demands of that process have grown so much in the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| the requirements of the state and federal processes have grown so much, it's become a real bottleneck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| We only have one person on the city staff that does all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| and as you can tell from this number, it takes several FTEs to get the work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1378)|
| 0:23:09| This particular, well, this is for on-call work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| so it's pretty much speculative how much work is going to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| It's a not to exceed $300,000 rather than for that specific number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| and we, of course, went through a bid process to decide on who was going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1403)|
| 0:23:32| But, yeah, I mean, the bottom line is that it's a real bottleneck to getting any work done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| and I have some examples of the kind of work that these folks will immediately start working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1418)|
| 0:23:49| We have a couple of bridge projects in process where we have to buy either construction easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| or permanent right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Sidewalk project on Woodland, there's a lot of right-of-way and easements that have to be negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1439)|
| 0:24:08| Jackson Avenue, there's some right-of-way negotiation that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| This is the short-term stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| There's plenty of more projects down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| I'm not sure that this $300,000 is going to last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| And so basically, Councilman Wallace, it's on-call as we need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| and it's just an estimate of what we might spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| That's why it's an even number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| But they don't get the money if they don't do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| They bill us for the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Is this something that is new to the budget, or is this something that's new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| It is mostly new to the budget just because the federal requirements have become so complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| and require so restrictive as to what we have to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| And it's really with the intention of protecting property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| What are you asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Is it within our budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| We have money in the budget, correct, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| It's mainly legal work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| I mean, is it more than you can hire a lawyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| This is mostly actually negotiating with the landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| You can hire a lawyer for $100,000 a year and have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| I just don't understand the scope of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| I'm just trying to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| It's a three-year agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| And there are probably hundreds of parcels, small and large, that they'll negotiate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1528)|
| 0:25:37| You might recall just in the last meeting or two, similar contracts for just the Cumberland project were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| And so this is when we have excess work and we don't have the capacity in the office to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| And it's actually more cost effective for us to go out and hire somebody to do these for specific projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| That way we're not otherwise we'd have to staff up with benefits and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| And so it's really a way to get the work done when it's needed on call rather than having staff there, you know, full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1560)|
| 0:26:11| Councilman Delamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Yeah, I might footnote the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| I can sense your frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| And, you know, the world of regulations brings consequences with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| And this is one of those that we're funding the receiving end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| But if you look at some of the scope of services on pages 184 and 185 in this packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| you'll notice that there's going to be some appraisal work, there's obviously going to be some survey work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| which is engineering type work, as well as the negotiations and relocation services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| And they have to prepare a number of, I guess, reports to satisfy TDOT and have public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| So it's not just a negotiation of a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| It's really finding out who owns it and what it's worth and trying to acquire it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| I sympathize with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| It sounds like a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Well, you also said it might not last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| So just kind of, you know, keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Yeah, I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| I think the other thing to realize here, too, is by having someone on call with a not to exceed amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| that what that does is, and I'm sure you've run into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| where if there's a $50,000 project, we're not having to go out and take bids to bring someone in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| So what we have here is a situation where we have a group on call that can go ahead and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| and do a lot of smaller projects at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| So I'm sure there is a cost savings from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Cozy Excavation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| and Contracting, LLC, for the site development detention pond improvement project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| for an amount not to exceed $99,116.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Yeah, this affects my district as well as Dwayne's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| but we have three different developers who have not completed the work they were supposed to do on detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| So the city is actually moving against the performance bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| and hiring a contractor to pay them with the original contractor's work since he defaulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| So this is a good thing, and it shows the prudence of having that requirement in our contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| So I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1717)|

| 0:30:12| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| I wonder if Jim York has stayed in the crowd here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| He's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| I guess you're the one to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| I don't know, but we're self-insured up to these limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| and then we're buying insurance if the sort of accident experience gets too big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| they pick up the overage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| This is excess coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| We have a rather large deductible, but anything over the deductible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| The $600,000 that's shown in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Do we collect on this insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Have we in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| In other words, we carry this kind of insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| and right now we're changing carriers because they're less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Actually, we hope we don't ever have to collect on this insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| I guess you're betting, what, $317,000 that you'll need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| Again, just to give you some idea of what happened in the two previous amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1857)|
| 0:31:05| the damage that we suffered in each of the two storms last year exceeded $1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| and compared to someplace like Tuscaloosa, that's a relatively minor amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| So what we're doing is we're buying excess coverage above that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| Now, a lot of the things that were insured last year were insured under different policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| but this is what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| So we assess our own tolerance for absorbing the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| and when it gets too big, we insure the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| necessary to sell surplus property located at 0 McCarty Avenue to Julie Evola for $2,002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| I'm going to make you exercise a little, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Maybe you could tell a little more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| It's probably no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| I was just curious about the trust out of California, I guess, that it's going to and why it's so cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| Boyce Evans, our purchasing agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Thank you, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Boyce Evans, purchasing agent for the city, 228 Braden Court, Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| The bottom line on this one is I've actually gone out and looked at the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| and it was, based on my assessments, probably less than $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| and Ms. Evola actually owns the adjoining property on either side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| and it's kind of landlocked in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| I mean, there's really nothing else you can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| We had another, frankly, we had another bidder that came in higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| but that's why you see here that that initially opened in December, but, sir, he didn't pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| He didn't go through with it, so we ended up going to the second bidder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| and she's probably going to make better use of the property since she, I don't know if she owns it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| and has family living right there or what, but she does own the property on either side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Before Boyce sits down, and the good news is they're going to pay, as part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| the delinquent taxes that are out there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| They pay everything that's delinquent on it, any tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| I've got the sheet in here somewhere, but any liens, any taxes that were delinquent, all of that gets paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| So we get rid of a piece of property we don't need, and we get our money back, so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Well, it was, yeah, the only reason I brought it up, it just seems so low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| I mean, is this person could build a home on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| I think they just need it to support their existing property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| and probably so somebody else doesn't take it and move in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| And this goes, I mean, you all are going to make a decision tonight on dealing with vacant surplus properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2040)|
| 0:34:08| and so forth, and this goes to those things where there's lots of little slivers out there in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| and maybe only one person would have need of it or could do anything with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| And I went out there and walked the ground, and, really, that's what this falls into, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| It's just I wouldn't want to buy it, but I don't own the land around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Yeah, I think last meeting we had there was one that was the homemaker's program is $9,500 for a parcel in 4th and Gil area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2068)|
| 0:34:36| which seems pretty cheap for a piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| You know, they're going to have to put a lot of money into it to bring it back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| It just sounds like a great deal for someone to get a parcel in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| So I appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| 11K is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for a grant award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| of $300,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| under the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies and Enforcement of Protection Orders Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| and if such application is approved, authorizing the mayor to accept such a grant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Councilman Dallavolpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Yeah, as long as we have Chief Rousher, maybe you can tell us about this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| because obviously families are affected by domestic violence and this is a way of dealing with some of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| What we utilize these dollars for is to assist in our Family Justice Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| and it's a model program, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| It's one of 15 that was originally established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| and the process that goes on there is there are 62 partner agencies that participate at the Family Justice Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2148)|
| 0:35:57| to fight violence against families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| So a victim would show up there and get all the services they need at that one location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| instead of having to travel around to find all the help they need to address any family violence issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| And it's a, as I said, it's a model program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| and this is an attempt to continue to fund some of those initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| I can imagine if someone's emotionally distraught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| to have a one-stop shopping location that gets the help you need would be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| It's vital in addressing the family violence issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2197)|

| 0:36:39| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| 11L is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to file a grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| with the State of Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| for the Victims of Crime Act grant in the amount of $225,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| with a local match of $56,250 for a total grant of $281,250| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| and if approved to execute any and all documents necessary to accept such a grant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Again, I'd like for Chief Roush maybe to explain this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| but I was just curious, are most grants that, especially through the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| is it usually a 25% match or does that vary with the grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| No, actually we have 19 grants that we're currently working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| and only four of those are matching grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| and so the other 15 are all 100% grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2244)|
| 0:37:32| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| 11M is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| to accept a grant in an amount up to $170,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| to provide funding for the operation and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| of a joint city-county household hazardous waste collection point for a period of two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2278)|

| 0:38:08| with a baseline sports construction LLC for the removal of existing fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| and installation of black ornamental steel picket fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2292)|

| 0:38:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Yeah, I just wanted something to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| I saw it in the paperwork that we actually awarded this once before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| because I was scratching my head seeing it seemed familiar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| but the guy couldn't get a bond or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| so we had to get a new contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| He actually couldn't get the performance bond, David Bray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| City Public Service, 2150 Maplewood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| So we did the original bid, the lowest bidder could not get the required performance bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| or insurance, and so we went to the next lowest bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| I think it was about $100, $150 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| So it was very close in terms of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Yeah, very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| Yeah, it was really pretty close to being within the three quotes within the purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| but it went just above that, so we had to bid it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| These are what, small businesses that may or may not have the wherewithal to guarantee the bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| I mean, Baseline's, you know, a decent-sized business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| I'm not sure why the original business boys stepped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| He had the purchasing managers that they contacted me and said they couldn't get what we needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| so we've gone to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| I said, great, we'll do the AIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| David, does TDOT pay for any of this, or do they help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| TDOT does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Do they ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| TDOT's maintenance folks do not have ñ there's a lot of fencing in the city between controlled access properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| that TDOT owns and interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| You know, if you go across the bridge into South Knoxville, there's a great example of lots of fencing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| They have limited resources to take care of fencing, and they would not typically assist with decorative fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| We actually met with a TDOT, the previous TDOT commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| and they had recommended submitting for a state grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| but it was going to take about three years to work through all the processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| It was going to require the same federal processes that Mr. Higgerman just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| So the city chose, along with Blount Mansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| to kind of work together to improve that entrance corridor in the downtown of the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2423)|

| 0:40:26| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| 11-0 is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| to apply for a grant from the Urban Sustainability Director's Network Innovation Opportunity Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| in the amount of $49,565 with a match of $12,500 in city staff time divided by the city and partnering cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2439)|
| 0:40:48| And if such application is approved to accept such a grant to create a white paper and toolkit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| for funding city sustainability offices and their initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2457)|

| 0:41:02| Is Ms. Sutherland here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| I've got to tell you, I read this and I was scratching my head trying to understand exactly what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| but I wasn't sure what we were sustaining, the funding, the ongoing funding of the offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| or a particular program, but we're working with, what, five other cities to bring this about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| Would you please explain the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Susanna Sutherland, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| The basic premise of this is that there is no national best practice that allows cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| who are trying to grow their sustainability program to understand the funding mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| for these types of initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Primarily, sustainability directors have environmental backgrounds, not finance backgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| and we would like to hire a consultant to help us with trust funds and revolving loan funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| and working with foundations to leverage funds in addition to the grants that we already capture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| to help us fund initiatives that don't then turn around and hit our capital budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| which in locales across the country are obviously tight right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| So it's sort of like not setting up a foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| but the idea is to get a pool of money that can be used to work on sustainability projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| To create a roadmap for folks to fund these sorts of initiatives without hitting their general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| and operating capital funds at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| And do you have specific projects in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| or is this just the broad view of how you get them funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| It's the broad view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| The motion passes and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 2, Article 7, Division 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| Section 2-722 concerning the disposal of real property owned by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Okay, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you, Dave, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| I have it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Dave Gartner wants to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| Please say your name and address, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| David Gartner, 207 Lake Forest Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| I happen to be the president of the Council of All Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| and we have been interested in the blighted property issue for over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| Today we have one of our members on the city's blighted property task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| We'd like to say thank you for these four ordinance changes coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| We appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| We understand that they're just the beginning of a larger project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| and we are interested in helping and continuing to work with the city on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Thank you, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| And thanks to COIN for all the great work you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| We appreciate you as a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Well, this is, like he mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| this is one of four really good starts on the problem of how we address blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| and we appreciate all the hard work that your staff did on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| I had one question about 12A, and that is it was talking about the expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| and maybe that rings Mr. York's name or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| but the expense of both viewing property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| and getting appraisals when sometimes the properties didn't have enough value that warranted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| and you end up sort of coming up short by the time you sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| You might be losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I understand the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| That can cost a couple hundred bucks, maybe $500 or $600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| What about the visiting the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Don't you look at the property before you sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| Douglas Gordon, Law Department, City of Knoxville, 6501 Trousdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| The problem with these properties is generally that they are of such low value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| that putting funds into visiting all of them and It's a net loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2681)|
| 0:44:49| It's a net loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| These are those snippets, these slivers and triangles that Boyce talked about a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2690)|
| 0:44:59| Projects were built and left little orphan pieces of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| and we're trying to get rid of them, and hopefully there's an adjoining owner that wants them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| In almost every case, only the adjoining owner is going to be interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| and in almost every case, the circumstances are such that an owner of a neighboring property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| simply will not be interested in putting very much money into acquiring them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| so we're trying to make it as inexpensive to the city of Knoxville so we can put forth this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| and get those properties and enhance private ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| Okay, and you're placing these little orphans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| 12B is an ordinance amending Chapter 6 of the Knoxville City Code to add a new Article 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| establishing an Office of Administrative Hearing Officer to hear certain building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| and property maintenance code violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Okay, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| I have one question about that, and I'm all for having that hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| but would that hearing officer require an additional staff person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| or would he be able to use the staff that we already have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| We would contract with that hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| The statute provides for us to contract with a hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| and you would approve of that contract with that hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| So that hearing officer would be an independent contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| and provide, as I used to do when I was your lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| I used to provide all my own staff and my own paper and all that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| and this administrative hearing officer would do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| That answers that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| There are actually several other cities in this area that have administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| that are using that, and so several of us will be using the same person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| more than likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| So you put that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| Go ahead, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| You put that out for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Is that what you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| David Bray, City Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| It would be under the thresholds for purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| We would just contract through somebody that has that training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| They're typically going to ask the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| They have a higher hourly rate than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| A couple hundred dollars an hour, I believe, is the standard going rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| So it's very similar to the civil service grievance process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| where they'll bring in an attorney to act in an administrative judge position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| judicial position, and they're usually there for a day or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| and then they roll out as a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| What do you think the annual cost is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| What do you estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| We submitted, Mayor O'Hara, we submitted to Mayor O'Hara a $20,000 annual cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| because we didn't know, but we knew we needed a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| So we figured that that would get us through several hearings in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| We'll know at the end of the next fiscal year what the true costs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| and how many times we'll use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| If I could footnote that, David,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| the one thing we're doing here that's really excellent in terms of the blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| is that instead of waiting for a monthly meeting of the Better Building Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| we can hold these hearings as needed and move on a blighted property more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| And that's actually in, I guess that would be 12C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| where we modify the Better Building Board to be an appellate board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| and the hearing officer, myself, would actually hold hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| So the administrative hearing officer is actually the tool we're going to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| to work with property owners that haven't been motivated by our traditional tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| So you're going to inspire them to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| We want to motivate behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| And so if our notices and the Better Building Board haven't motivated somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| to take the corrective action we would like, and it happens routinely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| we envision this the first year being those chronic violators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| folks that own multiple properties that are behind in taxes, multiple violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| So that's really the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Now, we may expand it in the future and we may use it more routinely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| but right now that's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| This is like a shillelagh to raise consciousness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=2940)|

| 0:50:09| So we're now to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| I just do want to take a moment, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| to thank Council for your support for these ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| and to recognize the staff that have worked so hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| David Brace, David Massey, Doug Gordon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| and all members of the Vacant and Blighted Properties Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| and the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| A lot of folks have been working on this for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| And we're not finished yet, but this is a good move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| We still have more, as we talked about at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| we have more items to work on to even strengthen our ability to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| But thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| And thanks to the neighbors who are here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Councilman Grieve, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| We have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| We have someone to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| I just had a quick question, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| I know we had the workshop the other day, which was really quite informative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| and good for us, but I was wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| have we heard from anyone in terms of any conflicts with the four issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| that we've already gone, if there have been any problems about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| I'm going to call on David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| I'm just curious if you've heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| Good day, Brace City Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| No, we've not had, really haven't had any complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| I think everything we've had has been very positive about we've been waiting for this for the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| We know it's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| So I've not had any negatives to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| They will come up, I'm sure, once we start to use the tools with folks though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| As their consciousness is raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| For public forum, we have Vivian Underwood Scheidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Ms. Scheidt, please come forward and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| Vivian Underwood Scheidt, 612 Clyde Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| First, let me say I appreciate how well you all work together as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| Your efforts to put Knoxville first are beginning to bear much fruit ever since this council took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| Mayor, it is wonderful to see you sitting in that chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| I'm a very big supporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| I've come and asked for five minutes of your time to address a disturbing report that I'm receiving from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3131)|
| 0:52:19| concerning area ministries being forced to leave Broadway when trying to feed the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| The last group was told that the land was private property belonging to TDOT and they would have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| Now, I'm a member of Compassion Knoxville's task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| and I would like to know what has happened to the report that we compiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| Has the council had time to take into consideration the information that we gathered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| This treatment of the concerned citizens that are trying to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| and the loss to the citizens who need the help is concerning me greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| Finally, as a suggestion, as you consider our report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| is it feasible to place a portable structure on that site as a daytime facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| and allow a unified services effort to help our brothers and sisters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| while a program is being developed to help the homeless and the mentally ill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| I'd appreciate it if you would consider that and give me some feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| Thank you, Ms. Scheib, for coming and making some comments tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| I was also a part of the Compassion Knoxville and really appreciated that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| We have not formally taken action on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| but I will tell you today three members of council met with the Volunteer Ministry Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| and, in part, talked about that report and actions that we may take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| The Coalition for the Homeless, I believe, is taking some lead in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3231)|
| 0:54:02| Bruce Spangler, who is the chair of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| I cannot tell you with any specificity where this is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| but the suggestions made in the Compassion Knoxville report are still on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3251)|
| 0:54:17| They have not been shoved aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| And it's of great interest of mine that we do pay attention to what the community said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| and begin to take some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| I know there is a desire on the part of the Compassion, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| the Homeless Coalition to have a conversation with you, Madam Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| and I'm sure that will happen soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Ms. Scheib, we don't usually use this as a question and answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| but I would be glad to schedule a time for us to meet with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| and our director, Becky Wade, and Mike Dunthorne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| and take your suggestions and then get back with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| And I can talk to you after the meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Just a slight correction to Councilman Saunders' remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| There are actually four members of council that attended that VMC luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| so I want Ms. Scheib to know that we are very concerned about the issues that you raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120320?start=3320)|
