| 0:01:59| For the mayor's report, where's Boyce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| Are the reports in front of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| In front of you, about a week and a half ago, our purchasing agent, Boyce Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| emailed you a copy of the Mentor and Associates Action Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| which is phase two of the contract that council approved some time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| to help the city increase the number of bids we receive from small and disadvantaged businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| So you now have the hard copies of that to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| And over the next month, my staff and I will be reviewing these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| talking about these recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| and determining which are actually feasible for us to implement at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| And so I encourage you to read the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| and if you have suggestions or questions or comments about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| please either talk to Boyce Evans, you all know Boyce, he's sitting back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| or contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| I'd be glad to talk to you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| I want to let you know that the police department is taking applications for the next Citizens Police Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=177)|
| 0:03:07| and those applications are due by August 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| And the goal of the academy, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| is to develop citizens who have the potential to influence public opinion concerning police practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| It's a great way to get to understand what our police officers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| The program is 12 weeks and meets on Thursday evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| More information can be found on the city website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| so we encourage folks in the audience and listening on TV to consider participating in our police academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=210)|
| 0:03:39| Also, the police department is undergoing the reaccreditation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| and tomorrow at 3 p.m. at the Moses Center on Carrick Street, which is in Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| which is where the police academy is, there will be a public hearing on this reaccreditation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=230)|
| 0:03:58| And so we invite and encourage the public to attend and to make any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| Also, since we're talking about the police a lot, I just want to thank Chief Roush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| and his folks at the training center, the training facility that we have for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| Last week I went out there, and they showed me how we train our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=257)|
| 0:04:24| I fired the Glock, the .40 caliber Glock pistol at a target and actually hit it several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| I shot the submachine gun, and I saw the training of video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=271)|
| 0:04:39| which is a simulated training experience so officers can practice approaching different scenes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| and it's actually an interactive process so they can be prepared for different types of high-stress situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| I observed the special ops team, our SWAT team, as they were practicing entering the shoot house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| you know, fully prepared and armed to deal with whatever they might be finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| And with the recent events that happened in Colorado, it really hit home to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| how important it is that we have our officers trained properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| I also rode on the driving course that they have out there and state-of-the-art skid pad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=315)|
| 0:05:23| in which they can put water on the course and can practice driving where you might skid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| How many cones are still standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| I have to tell you that I did drive the course very slowly, and one cone I toppled over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| but the rest didn't, and that was very slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| I did participate in a high-speed chase, and I was with one of the officers, and we were chasing somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=341)|
| 0:05:50| And I have to tell you, that is high stress, and they go fast, and they stop at the stop signs and speed up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=350)|
| 0:05:59| and they have a certain way of driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| It was really a fascinating experience, and it really hit me how important it is that we continue to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| particularly as we're going through the accreditation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| and we see the awful things that have happened in other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| how important it is that we have highly trained officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| and that we provide the equipment, the training, and the facilities they need in order to do their job to protect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=376)|
| 0:06:24| We hope that many of these things are not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| They don't have to do chases every day, thank goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| but when that has to happen or you have to have the SWAT team go in or whatever, they need to be trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| That evening, I also went to the PARCC meeting, the Police Advisory Review Committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| where we review and make sure that our police officers do everything properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| that they live up to high professional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| And it was an interesting day to see both the training and to realize that when they go in a high-stress situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=409)|
| 0:06:57| when the adrenaline is flowing after a chase or coming into a scene you don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| then we expect them to always make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| You know, we expect them to work professionally to make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| So it was an absolutely wonderful experience for me to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| And so I've asked Chief Roush to schedule some time so that you all could go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| probably in a couple of different groups, if you would like to go out and experience that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| You can bring your target back in and we can compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| I was going to ask, Mayor, did you start emphasizing the guns because you're here in front of Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| No, no threat implied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| Okay, I wanted to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| No, but I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| I would encourage you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| I thought that you all would really appreciate that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| So Chief Roush is going to be calling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Chief Roush's folks will call you and see if we can't schedule some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| It took me a couple hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| I guess I was out there two or three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| And I think you will really appreciate that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| And then we're going to do some training with the firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| That's kind of next on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| I've got problems here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| So look forward to a call from the Police Department about scheduling that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| And thank you again, Chief Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| And please tell all your training officers that, again, I was very impressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| and appreciated the time they took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Mayor, can I ask a question along those same lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| The accreditation thing, some of us who tried to call today, the line was busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| Is there a way to get in touch with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| You know, today was the day to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Today was the call-in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| Let me check with the assessors and see what their availability is to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| I know if you want to send an e-mail, we've been receiving e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| Just send an e-mail and I will make sure they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| You can send it to my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| And one final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| On this Sunday, the McGee-Tyson Airport will host a celebration to mark the 75th anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| As you know, they've been celebrating that kind of all year with different activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| But this one will be held from 2 to 5 p.m. on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| It will feature a living wax museum and a ceremony to include a time capsule dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=549)|

| 0:17:38| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| I guess Jim's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| There's a reference on the information sheet to 30 sites where they're going to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| these sidewalk repairs, and then the resolution talks about 45 sites, and I didn't know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| there was sort of some room to spare later or whether there's just a discrepancy in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| write-up, but I was trying to understand what we're shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| You caught something that I didn't catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| It's over 30 sites, so maybe 45 is over 30 sites, but I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Pretty sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| In terms of these sidewalk repairs, do you try to space them around the different districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1094)|
| 0:18:22| We have a priority system that's based on condition and use, but it's really not feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1102)|
| 0:18:34| to space them around the different districts because the distribution of sidewalks is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| spaced evenly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| So it's need for repair that's the driver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| You need repair and the amount of pedestrian use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| I sent you all a map that shows the distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| I have a few extra copies if you want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| It was kind of shrunken in the email version, so I wouldn't mind seeing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| You saw a lot of color and flashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1143)|
| 0:19:12| Thanks, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| I'll share it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Yes, I'd like to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| If you've printed them, I'll take that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| We'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| As a practical matter, how do we call these to your attention or how do neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| call them to your attention so you can evaluate them and then prioritize them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| What do we need to do as we get suggestions, complaints, whatever, from people who reside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| Let me respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| Before I pass out the map, I just wanted to note where the concentration is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| It's basically downtown and trolley suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| Anything built after about 1950 basically doesn't have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| That's true even of new subdivisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| A few of the newest ones do have sidewalks, and there's a few connections that have been added later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| But even in the newest areas, you still see just isolated sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| Of course, and the oldest sidewalks are in that inner city area because they were built years and years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| That's where the ones in the worst shape are because they've been there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| What about adjoining landowners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Do they have some responsibility to keep up the sidewalk in front of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| or is that purely a city matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| It is purely a city matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| I mean, if they want to take some responsibility for it, we certainly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| But generally, we do the major repairs, and for the most part, we need to keep it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1248)|
| 0:20:58| because we've got to meet some standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| And, in fact, if somebody wants to take it upon themselves to do some real repairs, they should get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Of course, you've got ADA requirements and everything else that you follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| But you started asking another question, and I didn't want to derail you from that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| You were asking about how do you get information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| You know, because we are on the receiving ends of phone calls, e-mails, complaints, or suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| how's the best way to get this information to your department from someone who's dealing with sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| so they can look at it, evaluate it, and prepare the list for next year or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| 311 or call Civil Engineering at Lorain, which is 215-6100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1302)|
| 0:21:50| Is there any particular person that heads up sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| Yeah, but the best way to handle it is to just get it in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| I mean, there is a system, either 311 or the person who answers the phone at Lorain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| Can take the information down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Can take all the information down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| And they'll send somebody out to take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| It goes in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| It gets prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| But please do bring them to our attention because it is a complaint-driven system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1336)|
| 0:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| So if you don't bring it up, you might not be heard at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| It might not be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| You have here it says the work should be completed within 365 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| If that's not done, is there some type of fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| Usually I guess they do complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Is there some follow-up on them if they don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| It's a they get paid for the work that they did up to that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| It's a not to exceed kind of contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| So if they don't get everything done that's in the contract within 365 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| then we got to start with the next contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| We carry that money forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Well, I'm glad to see some sidewalks being done in some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| Very much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1394)|

| 0:23:39| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| And one abstention, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1421)|

| 0:23:43| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| for the provision of athletic accident insurance coverage for the city of Knoxville athletic program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| There's an abstention on that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents necessary to accept a grant from Senior Service America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| Inc. in the amount of $92,748 with a city match of $12,157 to provide training services for low-income senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1452)|
| 0:24:22| so they can gain marketable skills that they may lead to employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Yeah, just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| I noticed that the period of agreement is July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Is Joe here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| So this has already begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Just clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| This is federal funds, and as you might guess, sometimes it's slow in coming around, but we work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| Actually, we're a subgrantee with Social Services of America, which has a contract with the Department of Labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| So it's slowly moving, and that's traditionally how it usually works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| We don't get our funding until the fiscal year already begins for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| So can we extend it beyond September 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Well, it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Because the federal fiscal year starts October 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| we should be getting a new contract for the following 12 months or following nine months sometime between now and October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1516)|
| 0:25:25| So actually we have, in our case, 24 days less time to complete this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| Right, but we're just operating under the premise that we are going to be performing these duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| and we are going to get funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| And we've had this contract with the Department of Labor for 30-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| so it's something that we just expect and accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| So we actually incurred costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| This is a reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Because we knew this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Because otherwise you'd have to lay people off for so many weeks and then bring them back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| As long as we have Joe, could you stick around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| Yeah, just for folks that might be watching, how do they find out if they can get in this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| and who would they contact and what's the age, starting age limit or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| In other words, how does it work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| Five, you have to meet certain restrictions regarding your income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| Mostly, if you're on Social Security only, you probably qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Once again, 311 is a great number to call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| and they refer you to Adrian Walker who runs this program for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| Just ask for the senior training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Senior services training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Senior services training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Senior aid program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1608)|

| 0:26:52| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all necessary documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| for a permanent greenway and riverwalk easement with Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| and two temporary construction easements with adjacent property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| for the purpose of constructing the City View Riverwalk Extension in South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1630)|

| 0:27:19| Oh, and all the rest are consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| So nobody has signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120724?start=1645)|
