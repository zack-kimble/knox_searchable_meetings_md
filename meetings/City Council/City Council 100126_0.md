| 0:01:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Very briefly on the mayor's report, several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| On the Henley Bridge item, the city is holding a follow-up public meeting on the upcoming closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| and renovation of the Henley Bridge at 530 this Wednesday in the small assembly room next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| The earliest possible date for the project to begin is early next year, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| We're obviously working with the State Department of Transportation and we're dependent upon them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| No date has been set at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| The bridge will be closed for 24 to 36 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| and the construction will widen the bridge from the current five lanes to six lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| A lot of you were at a well-attended public meeting last month at Greystone Presbyterian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| Based on public comment at that meeting and after a lot of consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| the city administration is recommending that the bridge be striped for five lanes of traffic and two bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| We'll talk more about how we arrived at that recommendation and hear from the public at the meeting again Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| A couple of other things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| The Saguaro Drive sidewalk project public meeting, January 28th, Sequoia Elementary School, 7 p.m. in the gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| Again, Sequoia Elementary, 7 p.m., elementary school gym for the Saguaro sidewalk between the Skagena and Southgate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=181)|
| 0:03:10| And success, I also want to thank everybody for the successful recycling event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| We collected eight tractor-trailer loads of old computer equipment at the plug-in-to-your-community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| computer recycling event at Chihuahua Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| And John Holman and his department worked with the county and West Knoxville Optimist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| and the Knoxville Rescue Squad to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| So grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| And one last thing while we're on mayor's report, I'm going to do a quick little point of privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| Stan McCroskey from the Fraternal Order of Police is here and wants to make a brief introduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| and then we will go on to the council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| Stan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| I come before you tonight and honorable members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| Many times we have argued, but we've agreed to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| And I think we've got a lot accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| I've served five years as president of the FOP, and I'm tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| And so, anyway, I want to come to you tonight and introduce our new president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| Hopefully, he'll carry on the rapport that we have built with council and the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| He's a 12-year veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| He's served two concepted combat tours in Iraq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| And he's, I think he's well on his way to great things, particularly if he follows me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| But don't take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| But, anyway, I'd like to introduce Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| He's the new president of the Fraternal Order of Police, volunteer at Lush, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| It's an honor to be here before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| It's an honor to represent the Fraternal Order of Police in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| I look forward to working with each and every one of you in the future in matters of concern to law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Thanks for being willing to serve, and we'll look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| And thanks for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Reports from council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Mr. Mayor, I just want to thank all of the people and organizations that have sent help to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| in Haiti, and I think I'd like for the council to go on record supporting all of the persons who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| suffered great losses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Thank you very much, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Go over some organizational stuff for council, a couple of dates to go over with everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| and some e-mails to watch out for and a reminder about dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| First thing to remind folks of is next Tuesday is the budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| I think everybody's heard of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| It starts at 8 o'clock in the morning, and it will be at the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| It will last until 2 or 2.30 in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| My sense for the newer members that, you know, you don't really need to prepare for this much at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| I always think there's a value if you sort of glance over the budget one more time just before you get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| but there will be a presentation from the administration on the setup of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| and what's involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| So that's next Tuesday, February 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| I want to remind especially the new members of council that there is a training on how we do zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| and codes enforcement, 5 o'clock on February 4th up in room 453.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| I will not be at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| I've asked Ms. Roddy to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| and I'm hoping she can sort of fill in for me on any of the little last minute questions that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| Again, 5 o'clock next Thursday, February 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| We have another workshop coming up at 5.30 on February 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| We're moving it back half an hour because that's an MPC day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| It will be next door in a small assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| and it's going to be on the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| And this is actually a workshop for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| There's some update they want to give and talk about some of the transitioning that's happening there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| and some of the new stuff that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| You should get an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| You should already have gotten an e-mail and get another one for tomorrow, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| Ms. Rojero would like to do our workshop in April on the five-year consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| There's some dates in there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| So please respond to let us know what days you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| And you should also have either gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| or get very soon an e-mail on scheduling the budget hearings in May and early June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=447)|
| 0:07:35| I want to get those set now so everything can work out on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| And I want to remind folks about our dinner next two weeks from today, February 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| We're going to talk a little bit about jobs for council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| You should get the e-mail from staff listing all the positions we have to fill, when they meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| a little more of what's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| If folks can respond with any preferences you have to do or not do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| I'm going to come to that dinner with some recommendations about how we do that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| and people can chew on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| I'm also hoping at dinner we can have a presentation from Mr. Greave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| and Mr. Woodhall on how we move forward on some of the visioning work we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| There will also be a dinner where we'll be doing an agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| which Mr. Pavlis has had a lot of success with when he was an MPC commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| We're going to try that out at a meeting and see how that works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| Also, just on a note, I want to thank Ms. Mitchell for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| She had been sick for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| I understand her voice is a little shaky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| And to say if it gives out on you, the mayor will fill in on anything that needs to be read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| And everything I just said is sort of open to questions if people have or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=532)|

| 0:09:07| I have a question to Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Is an hour going to be enough for that dinner with all that you have planned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| Had we not better start at 5 or 5.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| We're going to try and do it in an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| I think we're asking a lot of time for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| If members want to start earlier, we, you know, we have to settle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| If my tendency was to say we'll make it happen in an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| If I guess what I can ask is Ms. Mitchell to send out an e-mail asking folks whether they're willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| and able to start early and we can take a poll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| and see what folks think because there will be a lot to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| And we do occasionally like to talk sometimes, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| For the record, that's the first time anybody has ever asked Vice Mayor Becker to talk longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| I was thinking about Chris and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=597)|

| 0:11:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| I think, Mr. York, we might have an amendment someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| So let me ask Mr. York what the status is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| You should have a revised budget amendment in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| We have made one change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=677)|

| 0:11:26| and improvements at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| The change in the budget amendment is to increase the capital budget by an additional 420,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=691)|
| 0:11:40| That will be funded by a transfer from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=700)|

| 0:12:04| I'll be happy to answer any other questions if you have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=724)|

| 0:15:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| First of all, I'd like to thank all the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| members for taking time out of their schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| over the last week to meet with me and discuss this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| I guess I'm too close to that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| I'll give you a little history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| I am, by history, a home builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| And like a lot of home builders in these economic times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| I've had to find a different way, or a different avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| to make a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=939)|

| 0:15:44| It's a fixer-upper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=944)|

| 0:15:50| to Forest Brook subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| I think all of you have pictures of the original house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| It was a 40-year-old house that had gone to seed and needed a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| But I felt like it had a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| It was in a great neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| And so I bought it with the idea of fixing it up and possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| make a little profit off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Well, in the meantime, waiting for the house to close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| I came up with a plan for the house and what it needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| what I felt like I could do to it to make it more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| And I came up with a plan, closed the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| And there were a number of things the house needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| It needed aesthetic work, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| I felt like it needed a front porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| It needed more square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| It needed just gutted, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| But one main thing it needed was for it to conform and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| in character with the neighborhood was a covered parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| And I felt like the side of the house was set up perfectly for covered parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| There was plenty of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| It had an existing driveway that ran right up to where I planned to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| And so the minute the house closed, I jumped right in it and started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| And the first thing I did was build the carport and build the front porch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| without a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Your head popped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Without a building permit, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| I got ahead of myself and forgot to get my permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| I got in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| About two weeks in, I go to get my permit, and they permit the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| and all the work that I want to do on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| But obviously, I can't get it on the carport because they informed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| that it's past a setback line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| And that was the first time that I had even considered that I was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| having setback problems on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| I asked them what my options were, and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Well, you need to tear it off or get a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| So I went before BZA, applied for a variance, and it was a new experience for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| Like I said, I built for 25 years, but I've never had a variance before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| I've never needed one or a code problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| And they kept asking me what my hardship was, and I really didn't understand what they were asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| The meeting went on, and I realized that nobody on the board had seen the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| or really knew much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| They just knew what was in front of them and essentially told me I should know better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| and turn me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| In hindsight, you know, if it was today, I'd tell them my hardship was that I had a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1094)|
| 0:18:22| that I had to conform in character and aesthetics to the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| And to do that, I needed a carport sitting in that spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| and that was the only spot that I could put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| And twofold, I had two setbacks, double setbacks on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| which ate up a good part of my yard and really restricted the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| Now, the first thing I want to tell you is this was not done maliciously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| As honest as I can be, I can tell you it wasn't done maliciously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| It wasn't done to beat the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| I just got ahead of myself and made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| Secondly, the carport in question, while it is past the setback line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| it still is 25 feet off the road, sits well below the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| There's no sight line problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| It lines up with the old existing driveway, sits back inside of the fence line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| and the tree line and is in character with a number of properties along North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1162)|
| 0:19:31| I think I put some of those pictures in your packet, too, as far as distance from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1171)|
| 0:19:40| I've got really total support from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| I closed that in your packets also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| I've got a statement of support for my project from the whole street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| They really like what I've done with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| I've improved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Aesthetically, I've brought it up to what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| And I don't go down the street more than every other day before one of the neighbors stop me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| and say, hey, thanks for fixing that house up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| And that's just about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Councilman Grieve, do you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| Yes, I'd like for Steve King to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| Do you have a particular thing, councilman, you want me to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| It's the sequence of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| Well, I think Mr. Ryan pretty much accurately described what had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| He indicated that he started work without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| The inspections office received the complaints and an inspector out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| and determined that there was work going on without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| At that point in time, a stop work order was issued and Mr. Ryan came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| and got the permit like he described that he was able to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| He wasn't able to get a permit for the carport addition because of the setback problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| At that point in time, he was advised he would either need to remove the carport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| or seek the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| And he applied for the variance, was turned down, and has appealed it to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| And that's what brings us here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Mr. Ryan, I believe you invited all the members of council to come out and meet with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| and look at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| And I'm sure some of us were able to go and some not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| But when I came out, I talked with you about how important it usually is to this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| that the neighborhood feel good about variances like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| And you indicated in your petition that you've spoken with a number of neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| But at the time I was out, you hadn't had the opportunity to reach the neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| directly across the street and next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| And I believe I got an e-mail to that effect from you this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| But if you could emphasize again, because at least for me, it was very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| that the folks that are most adjacent to this property have met you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| and understand your plans for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| I tried to obtain or meet the folks across the street and next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| When I got the other signatures, we missed each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| And but since then I have talked to both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1347)|
| 0:22:37| Eric Backus and Sarah and Adam Wilch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| Wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| I can't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| I can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| But anyway, I've spoken to both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| And they're, like I said before, they're thrilled with what I've done over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| And they supported it wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| I gave them the petition or the letter of support that I made up, and they read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| And they were more than happy to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| And have you encountered anybody in the neighborhood who is opposed to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| When I first read my packet and I looked at this, I thought, oh, this is easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| But then after coming out and really looking at your circumstance, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| and I appreciate you meeting me and showing me around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| And also, I don't like the fact that you did not pull the permit and we talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1409)|
| 0:23:40| I think where we're at right now is that you do have a good house and it does fit into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1420)|
| 0:23:48| And it's very important to me also that the neighbors feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| We didn't land here the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| It does feel a little bit like doing the right thing the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| But this is where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| And I'm inclined actually to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| Be curious to know what other people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Mr. King, you were asked a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| And I was wondering, looking at the map that's in the package of the parcel, it shows the carport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| And then it shows the setbacks from North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| Would you explain to me the difference between I guess we have a photograph here showing the paved surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| and the width of the actual right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Does North Shore have more right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| How close does it come to this carport?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Are we ever going to widen that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Where does that leave us if this carport stays there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| Are we okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| There's a reason for the setback, and I'm trying to understand that in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| Well, I don't have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| I don't think of what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| I'm looking at what's in the council package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| It may be similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| The setback is measured from the North Shore Drive right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| And as you can see, there's a dimension of five feet from the North Shore right-of-way to the edge of the carport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| And there's also a dimension on the one I'm looking at of 24.4 feet from the North Shore right-of-way to the existing house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1519)|
| 0:25:28| And what you're being asked to do is to vary the required setback from 25 feet to five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1528)|
| 0:25:37| In regards to your question about improvements to North Shore, as I recall, in the late 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| TDOT did a feasibility study that looked at widening North Shore to four lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| Since that time, there hasn't been any additional work done on design or any additional feasibility studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1552)|
| 0:26:00| There's nothing in TDOT's work program for North Shore at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| But technically, we'll be five feet from the actual right-of-way, not the pavement, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| That's the right-of-way, not the pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| So if they widen and use that right-of-way, then the house will be up against the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| If they used all the right-of-way, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| There are some pictures beside you that do have the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| The photograph shows the property set reasonably far back from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| The question is, is there a difference between the technical right-of-way and the pavement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| That's what I was trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| There is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| I don't have that information with me, but I looked at the site myself, and I would estimate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1598)|
| 0:26:47| it's probably 15 to 20 feet from the right-of-way line to the edge of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| That's an estimate on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I don't have a drawing to give you that information precisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| Well, as the city engineer, how do you feel about this kind of structure moving closer towards the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| I guess the question I'm trying to get at, and I'm not sure how to ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| Well, I'm really not sure how to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| I don't mean it as a personal gut feeling, but the idea that you're in charge of roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| and things that are going to be affected in the future should some of your plans come to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1642)|
| 0:27:31| Well, in any situation where the city or the state may have a road improvement project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| obviously additional right-of-way will have to be purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| It's difficult to say whether that carport would have to be purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| or if the road widening would become so close to the carport that it would damage the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| I guess your question is, would this addition cause a road project additional expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| And there's just really not any way to know at this point because the design hasn't been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| One of the most ---- I had an opportunity to go out, I believe Saturday, and visit with Mr. Ryan and his wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| and got to firsthand see the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| And the most ---- one of the most important questions that I had for Mr. Ryan was he's been a builder in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| And, you know, quite honestly, I just asked him, had you been habitually, has this been a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| And he assured me that it had not been a problem, that this was a first-time offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| or oversight or whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| So that ---- and I want confirmation of that on record here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| So that made me feel a little bit more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| Another comfort level that I got to is it's not dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| It doesn't block any sight, line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| In fact, if you look down back towards town, I mean, there's a lot of property out exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| And then lastly, I mean, I do tend to probably favor this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| It does blend and enhances the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| They did a fantastic job on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| So, Mr. Woodhull, you ask and that's your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| I guess since Mr. Woodhull asked, I was just going to say I kind of in a lot of ways I agree with so much what Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| Woodhull and Mr. Pavlis said, and I'm inclined to support this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| I had the opportunity to also go out and talk with Mr. Ryan and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| And from my perspective, where I'm coming from, I really have a difficult time with the fact that one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| reasons that we have codes are to abide by those codes and to honor what the setbacks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| And what we have here is a situation where had a building permit been asked for early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| the situation wouldn't be at our desk right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| It is possible, and Mr. Ryan and I talked about this, that I had the opportunity to go out and also spend time with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| and at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| And it is possible that the carport could have been put at the back of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| and the driveway to where this would not be an issue today on that, had the proper procedures been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1818)|
| 0:30:27| Again, what I struggle with is the fact that one of the reasons that we have codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| and one of the reasons that we have zoning is to protect neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| I did mention to Mr. Ryan that it would be a good idea for him to contact his neighbors and get their response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| and also the neighborhood association out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| But I think that we also have a responsibility to see to it that codes are upheld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1848)|
| 0:30:56| and that situations like this really shouldn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I have a concern about if and when, and we don't know when North Shore is going to expand, but what happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| I do believe that what they have done to the house is definitely attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| It's really enhanced the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| But I also think that they could solve the problem another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| And had procedures been followed correctly, I think we would have that solved in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| So from my standpoint, I would have to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| I'll afford to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| And I'll come back to you, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Mr. King, I wanted to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| There are no plans currently on the books to widen North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Mr. Ryan, I just want to compliment you on the work you've done here and reaching out to your neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| and to us council members and the information, the pictures, the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1920)|
| 0:32:08| It's almost like there's 18 households worth of people standing back here, which normally they do come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| Generally speaking, I don't ever recall myself or really the council in the six years I've been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| having any problem with a variance like this when there's no safety issues or no sightline problems or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| no neighbor complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| I mean, this increases the property values of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| It's at the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| It's a real compliment to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| And I don't recall that we've ever had a problem when it wasn't brought to us by the neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| or by the neighbors themselves complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| And I think you've taken a pretty bad piece of property and turned it into an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| And it's consistent, like Councilman Pavlis said, with the other homes that go up and down along North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1975)|
| 0:33:03| When you look at the property, which I did, it's inside the tree line, way inside the tree line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| It's way inside the fence line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| And the thing that I noticed is that the neighbor next to you, above you, his property is even closer to North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| And so while, like Councilman Woodhull, I don't agree with, you know, not being aggressive in getting the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| but yet I would say that our codes department could spend all of their time going around in different neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| finding violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| It's not hard to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| And I know Mr. Ryan, and I know he's an honorable, credible, respectable businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| And this would never happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| And so I forgive you for the lack of the permit, and I'm going to support your appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| I would just also like to say that I want to be sure that Council has read the Board of Zoning Appeals minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| Be sure to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Seeing no further lights, the motion on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| So we'll try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Actually, why don't you just go ahead and call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| So a no vote is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| I means you're agreeing to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| The motion fails two to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| We will need an affirmative motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| I'll make the motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Just a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| And I do appreciate Mr. Ryan's efforts here and to try to show us that what he has is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| compatible with the neighborhood and that the neighbors find the improvements acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| I am concerned, and I think we've already crossed this bridge, but I am concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| the moral hazard that somehow we're going to give the message that it's easier to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| forgiveness than it is to get permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| And I am concerned that, of all people, you at least knew the ropes about how to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| as a builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Well, I will speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| I know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| I know I need a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| I'm not making excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| You never presented it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| And as I said before, I keep bringing it up, I've built in this town around here for 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| years, and this is the first issue I've ever had with codes or a variance, the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2141)|
| 0:35:49| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| And I just wanted to make the comment that I don't want to start setting a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| where if someone does an end run around the codes and the rules and the permit requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| that you automatically get forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| And I know that that's not your habit, not your style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| But I just wanted to say that because I think it's important that this council at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| send that message, even if we do approve this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| Councilman Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Once again, I do want to be sure to go on record with the fact that I do appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| what Mr. Ryan has done and what he has done for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| But I'd also like to ditto what Mr. DellaVopi has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| The concern that I have is that it's extremely important that we support the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| and it's extremely important that we don't set precedent on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Councilman Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Well, again, I mean, I hear what my fellow council members are saying and I can appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| But even at that, and Mr. Ryan would, you know, back me up and say the first thing I asked him is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| you know, how many times, you know, has this occurred before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| And, you know, and if it had, then, you know, I'd have a real problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| But, you know, he made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| He's admitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| He hadn't tried to hide anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| And the enhancement of the neighborhood and, you know, the safety factor, I want to go ahead and support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| But I agree that doesn't mean that we give people a free hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| You know, you're going to get spanked one time and, you know, the next time you're not going to get what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| So I don't want to send that message either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Yeah, I guess two thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| One, I agree with Mr. Pavlos about what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| I guess, Mr. DellaVoppe, I think that the unfortunate truth is it is easier to ask forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| You know, we don't really punish people for not getting a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| The unfortunate part is lots of people don't get permits and don't need variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| And there's nothing that gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| So, you know, the issue of punishing somebody for not getting a permit isn't what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| We're actually talking about a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| The second thing I want to say, we had – I don't know if the folks who weren't here before were very up on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| gentleman we had at the end of Beer Board trying to build the restaurant in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| And sometimes we can fall into something while we appreciate the codes and the laws and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| Sometimes we fall into something where we just got laws that don't let people do things that make a whole lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| And that was a little better case than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| And I don't think – I don't think we can afford to fall into something to say, well, the law says X| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| and we have to let that happen because the laws, as you'll learn, as you sit on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| laws are not always made thinking about all the possibilities that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| So as a policy, I think it's important for us to keep some of that openness to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| and I think the Mechanicsville restaurant is a really good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| I mean, there was somehow he's not allowed to put a restaurant in a building that would be great for a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| because we put a lot of laws and conditions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| And we need to be very clear about how we don't let the laws we write with good intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| keep us from fulfilling other good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Councilman Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| I was essentially going to say just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| And it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| You were going to say it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Yeah, much more eloquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| I want to go on record as saying that I appreciate and agree with everything that Councilman Grieve is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| But this is why there are these moments when we have to make a judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| And this might sound like an odd thing to say, but sometimes the facts get in the way of the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| especially when you go out there and you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| But I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| I also went down and looked at the property, and it looks all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| But I wanted to ask Mr. Swanson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| If we approve this variance, will that set any kind of precedent for anyone else coming with the same situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| Well, variances are all considered on their own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| The whole concept of a variance is it's something that's different than the usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| That's why you're asking for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| In terms of setting a precedent, my response to that would be mostly no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| There are certain parameters within which you're permitted to consider variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| I can read those for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| They're in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| If you would like me to read them for you, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| I've got them up here on the computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| But, in essence, you should not grant variances outside of those particular parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| And it's up to you to decide whether you are or whether you aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| I don't think you need to worry so much about setting a precedent in terms of granting variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| because they are each considered on their own merits with respect to the situation that's come before you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2438)|
| 0:40:47| Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| I want to address what Vice Mayor Becker had to say about the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| I think what we're looking at here, and one of the things that I think we need to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| when we talk about codes is that we're also talking about process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| And that one of the things that we have, and part of the reasons that we have a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| is that we have folks who are to get permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| They take their plans to the building department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| The building department looks at them, and then they flag whether or not there's problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| So it's not a matter of necessarily just looking at the code and saying, well, something's happened here or it hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| So one of the things that I want to be sure that we don't, whether the words tamper with or misconstrue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| is the fact that there is a process that we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| And, again, not to penalize Mr. Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| And as I told him when I was out there, I certainly appreciate what he's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| and I certainly appreciate the upgrade of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| But had the process been followed, then, as I said earlier, we wouldn't be here talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| because there are other ways in which to handle the situation with the carport on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| And so, again, part of what I'm looking at is not only the code and what's required by the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| but the folks that are in the city who support the codes and look after the codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| they have a process also in which they have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| And that's really what I personally am looking at in this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| And I'm certainly not interested in penalizing Mr. Ryan for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| But I do think that we have to be careful in terms of whatever the variance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| when it comes before this body on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| So I just wanted to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Yes, Mr. DelValle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| And I will apologize to all of you for speaking again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| I said in my piece, and it's not this particular application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| but the reality is that a variance normally is given where the property has physical limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2561)|
| 0:42:51| that don't let you live with inside the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| And this is sort of a different beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| We got the cart ahead of the horse in terms of how we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| That doesn't change the fact that the surrounding neighbors have supported this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| and that means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| But the normal variance, and Charles, you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| usually looks at we're trying to make this particular piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| that has physical limitations not, you know, you can't build there and follow those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| So we're trying to apply a law to an unusual set of facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| I guess this is a form of variance where we're concerned that there will be some loss of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| or whatever that's going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| That's enough said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Ms. Mitchell, if you'll call the roll one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2620)|

| 0:43:44| Abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2635)|

| 0:46:26| I'd like to call on Deputy Mayor Martin and ask if he could go through a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| the process involving the cemetery relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| I know we have some people from the State of Tennessee here from the Department of Veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2800)|

| 0:46:45| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Let me do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| I would love to talk about it first in terms of we'll explain the process of how we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| how this location came to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| And then we'll have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| And maybe, Larry, unless you want to, I'll go ahead and call on Commissioner Keyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| I'll ask Commissioner Keyes to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Commissioner Keyes is the State's Commissioner for Veteran Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| His deputy, Chuck Taylor, is with him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| And I will turn the podium over to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| And then you all are obviously free to ask him questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Good evening, Mayor and members of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| It's a pleasure for me to be here with you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| And thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak on behalf of Resolutions 11C and 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| As you said, I have my Assistant Commissioner with me tonight, Chuck Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| who is over at the Cemetery Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| We've also got with me this afternoon Mike Fowler with Fowler & Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| our consultant, and Ms. Helen Henning with our QE2, our environmental consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| If I could, just let me, a few moments, just share a little bit of brief history with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| as how we got to this point and at this time, if you would please bear with me just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| A little background information on the cemetery site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| The cemetery on Lake Shore had its first burial on August 2, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2876)|
| 0:48:04| As of January 20, 2010, there are 5,001 veterans buried in East Tennessee Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| Based on the current burial levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| East Tennessee Veterans Cemetery will reach its capacity in late 2011 or 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| In preparation of closing East Tennessee Veterans Cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| we reviewed the 1988 master plan for cemetery expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| Our architects and our designers developed and required plans to accommodate the expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| of the Lake Shore site and forwarded the plans to Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| As you know, we had originally planned to just move an expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| across Lake Shore to the other side of the Lake Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| And because of certain anomalies that we found when we went in to do these kinds of site visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| and that we sent these plans to Washington, that property was disapproved for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| At that time, we began the process of looking at an alternate site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| and we came to Knox County, the mayor, we were talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| and we began to look at that and looked at the money that it was going to cost us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| to do this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| So we decided to ask, will we consider an alternate site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| And initially, my thought was an alternate site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| and I'm looking at it in terms of an expansion being a piece of property adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| or contiguous to our current property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| But when we looked at that and the property on the new site was presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| it came out to be a beautiful site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| This site would provide us burial plots that would allow us to probably be in existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| for another 60, 65 years, as opposed to the current site that we had planned to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| which would have probably given us enough burials for the next 15 or 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| And really, when we looked at it from that standpoint, from a practical standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| but from an economical standpoint, it was really, to me, it was a no-brainer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| that this was an ideal site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| It's a beautiful site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| When developed, we'll continue to provide the veterans in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| with a beautiful site to take care of the burial needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| and as far as providing veterans that last, final benefit that they are entitled to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| and that is being buried in a veteran's cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| We have done due diligence in bringing it to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| We have been doing our assessments, doing our QEQ, the site assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| All of it has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| The approvals have been sent in to Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| In fact, we had the gentleman who is the secretary over the state cemetery grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| come down and look at the site and has approved that site for expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| for the new site for the East Tennessee Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| We are in line to, and in fact, not only did they approve the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| but we have also been approved for $2.4 million for the expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| as far as the development of the site on the new site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| We are looking at right now, the final steps that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| as far as the approval from the city council in terms of the land swap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| as far as your service to that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| We appreciate all that you have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| We appreciate all the work that the mayor has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| in terms of cooperating with us in terms of all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| in order to bring about final closure on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| The only thing I would say is that we are in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| If we are not, any grievance, in fact, if we lose our place in line for the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3093)|
| 0:51:41| I am afraid that at the time that this cemetery closes in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| which is proposed to the client, it is going to bring a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| on the veterans in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| The bottom line is that if we do not have this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| in time to make a smooth transition to the new site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| that hardship will mean that veterans will either have to be buried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| at our other two current state veteran cemetery sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| that being in Nashville or in Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| or they may choose a national cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| and the closest national cemeteries will either be Johnson City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| or Chattanooga, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Other than that, if they want to be buried locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| they would have to go to a private cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| where they would incur additional costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| Really with that, Mayor and members of the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| again, we thank you and we appreciate all of your due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| and your support for this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| and we look forward to moving this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| whereby we will be able to meet the needs of the veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| at the time that we close the current site in 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| and transition to our new site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| We do have a couple of people sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| If you want to ask Commissioner Keyes a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| this is a fine, but we have a couple of people that I know want to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| so I'm going to call on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| But you're welcome to ask Commissioner Keyes something now or later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| either one, your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| Well, I think Commissioner Keyes may have just hit on the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| in his last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| This is the only area short of going to Johnson City or Nashville or Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| for an East Tennessee veteran to be buried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| To be buried in a veteran's cemetery, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| And the existing cemetery is order of magnitude 18 or 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| The one that's filling up, and we're talking about 68 acres now of expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| So you have a lot more capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| We've got a lot more capacity, and it will take us way out into the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| as far as being able to supply that need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| and meet the need of the veterans in this East Tennessee area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| Correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| I read the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| I understand that the Lakeshore site would be a much smaller cemetery addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| by comparison to the Old French Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| That's all I have for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Commissioner, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| And last night you mentioned, and I don't believe I heard you mention this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| how many sites you actually looked at here in East Tennessee and narrowed it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| Councilman, we looked at, I believe it was 32 sites before we came up with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| ideal site that we are looking at currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| And then there were, I think you said last night, there were six finalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| There were six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| And I can, I've got, we can have some others that can help me with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| There were six finalists, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Yes, sir, there were six finalists in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| And all those, due to certain circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| a lot of them were weeded out because of accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| inability to acquire their land and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| And we came up with this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| And then also I think you mentioned last night that the Veterans Administration has said that the present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| or the new, the expansion to the Lakeshore site would be unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| The current plans to move across the Lakeshore Drive are unacceptable to the federal VA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| who is funding this project at 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| So if you didn't, if we didn't proceed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| then it's definite that the land across the street would not be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| You'd have to find another site, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| And that's really, that's coming from the feds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| That is coming from the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Based upon all of the internal investigation, the site preparation kinds of things that have been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| it is not acceptable to them to fund as an expansion site for our current cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| And the other question I asked you last night, I've gotten several telephone calls since this is in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| several telephone calls from veterans who had requested whether or not, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| they could reserve a space there because of relatives and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| And you had an answer for that, if you'd care to share that also so that it would be on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| In terms of the current site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| We do not make reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| However, if they want to be interred there prior to its closing, they would have to make an exit at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3354)|
| 0:56:06| You'd have to make a specific appointment, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| Well, I think the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| It's a bad trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| The concern that was addressed to me on several telephone calls was the fact that some people were upset that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3371)|
| 0:56:19| quote, out-of-state, out-of-area, out-of-region folks were being buried there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| And you addressed that for me last night, if you'd care to say what the federal rules are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| The federal rules basically, if we are in compliance in terms of you're talking about a residency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3390)|
| 0:56:38| you know, from veterans of veterans of veterans, they have no residency in terms of where they are serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3398)|
| 0:56:47| They go where they're asked to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| And the federal regulations allow any veteran that's honorably discharged to be buried in any veteran cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| throughout the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| And so in order for us to be in compliance with that, our regulations have changed back in 03 to meet those federal guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| And so we are in compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Thank you for being here, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| Good to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| I wanted to ask you about the availability of federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| You said that if this is voted down, when would funds be available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3438)|
| 0:57:26| And how would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| I know you have to go look at other sites and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| But how long would that take if this was voted down and you had to look at another site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3452)|
| 0:57:40| The availability of federal funds, will it still be available two years, three years, four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| What's the deal on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| The process, Councilman, is that if we say if we get out of line and lose our place for funding currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3468)|
| 0:57:58| we would have to reapply, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Now, as to when would the funds be available, it's based upon the availability of funds on the federal level for a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| Our priority level right now with Tennessee, we're at number nine on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| We would go to the bottom of the list in terms of priority, in terms of application processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| And we'd have to start the whole thing over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Now, when we would come up with funding, it would be determined as to when we would send the next application in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| and the availability of funds that would be there based upon what we would need for the total application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3507)|
| 0:58:36| So that could be two or three years down the line, somewhere along in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Thank you very much, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| There might be some questions later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| I'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| We have two other folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| First is Dick Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| Mr. Morgan, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Dick Morgan, 2217 Dawns Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| I want to speak on the Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| I live right near Lake Shore, and that is where I intended to be buried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| But it's going to be filled up next year, and I hope I don't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| We have two issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| The city wants a piece of property in Lake Shore, and the state needs a piece of property for a new Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3559)|
| 0:59:26| I think the state can give that 17 acres to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| The other proposal is for the city to buy 68 acres on John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| and trade that 68 acres for the 17 acres in Lake Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| And the 68 acres will become a new Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| If you've never been out there, it is a beautiful piece of property, but not for a Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| It's an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| I have pictures here to give to all the councilmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| It is last night at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| There was not one veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| There was not one veterans group endorsed this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| It would be a great piece of property for the state to put in their back pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| When a company comes in and needs to build a place to employ our friends and neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| we can give it to them or sell it to them at a low price, but not for a Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| We can use it for wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| We can use it for UT can use it for an agricultural experimental station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| It's right there on the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| Great dirt, all rivered, but not for a Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| I do have a site for the Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| The state of Tennessee owns a farm here in Knox County, 425 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3644)|
| 1:00:51| Now there's like 25 cows, I counted them today, residing on that 425 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| It is a beautiful piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| I have a picture here to give to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| The downtown skyline is right on the Tennessee River and the Holston River at the forks of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| It is a gorgeous, gorgeous piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| If the agriculture department needs to take that 68 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| there's plenty of room there for a Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| Lakeshore and this UT farm, it's right past the corner of Holston Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| Holston Hills Drive, and Riverside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| It will make the most beautiful cemetery you'll ever see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| Lakeshore Park and this farm is the two most beautiful sites in Knox County, in Knoxville City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3701)|
| 1:01:50| It will be a place that the veterans will be proud to be laid forever, not in the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3710)|
| 1:02:02| You need these pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| If you want to bring them up, I think council would be glad to pass them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| Judge Ken Urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Yeah, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Councilman Brown has a question for you, Mr. Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| That location, Mr. Morgan, Holston Hills Drive and Riverside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| Is that where the prison used to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| It is a gorgeous piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| Mr. DellaVolpe had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Mr. Morgan, I think there's one more question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| Sorry, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Mr. Morgan, I guess I'm a little confused because I know that there are sections of an industrial park off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3768)|
| 1:02:56| John Sevier, but I understood from looking at that property that when you cross the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| you are in a combination of agricultural land and residential land that surrounds that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| and that there is no industrial right in this sector that you have to go north on John Sevier to get to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3789)|
| 1:03:17| part that has the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Isn't that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| When you see these pictures, the industrial park, there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| All the used to be called bulk materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| It's got a new name now, the rock quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| All the crushers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| The rock quarry, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| And it's just very, very ugly to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Now, that side of the river, there's a church there and some residential homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| but you're looking at the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| You're not looking at something nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| You're looking at a place where we work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| I work there every day in that industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| It's not a place for fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| It's not a place you go walk your dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| It's not a place that you go take your kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| It's a place to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Nick, you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| I was just going to ask him or at least tell him that it's been my experience that when at least I have talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| to the University of Tennessee about getting some of their agricultural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| whether it's for a park or a greenway, that they are very jealous of giving up even an inch of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| And we have spent time in years past talking about a greenway on the very property you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| and were turned down by the UT Ag School as not in their plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| and they're not making any more ag land as far as they're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| And they think that that's very precious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| I know that that doesn't answer your question about the beauty of that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| and I will agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| I think that's one of the prettiest pieces of land in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| I certainly wondered whether it was better to go to prison and get assigned to that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| than be out in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| And I appreciate your selecting that piece of land as something that's attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| But I will tell you that UT Ag School has been very, very jealous about giving up an inch of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| Well, I agree with them, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| But we're here as the best for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| We're not here just the best for one cow or one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| We're here as a society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| We're here to do things the best for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| Can you give us your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| My name is Ken Irvine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| My address is 942 Luttrell Street in the historic Fort McGill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| And I'm here tonight as the commander of post two of the American Legion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| Our post is 650 members here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| We are but a small fraction of the veterans, though, that live within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| There are thousands of veterans that are here and live and work in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| There are not many issues that are closer to people than where their loved ones are going to be buried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| And this issue has sparked a lot of interest in the last few days among the veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| And I can tell you at our post that I have been called repeatedly from members that want answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| about how did we get to where we are today, because we were not part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| We have questions, and I want to make clear also that we're not saying there's not a need for another site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3973)|
| 1:06:21| We need a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| This is a very important benefit for veterans and their spouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| And often their children can be buried also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| So we're not opposed to a new veteran cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| And at this point, we're not opposed to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| But we have questions that we'd like to have answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| And you heard questions about the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| It is very close to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| The traffic that goes in front of this site has a lot of the vehicles from that industrial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| This quarry has been the one that we've heard the most about from the people that live out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| The site, the 68 acres, has a border of the river and directly across the river are bluffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| and that's where the quarry starts right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| We have been receiving calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| I have had people stop me here in the city county building to say that they live out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| and that they have had problems with foundations that have cracked from blasting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| pools that have cracked, things of that nature, wells that have had to be replaced due to damage from blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| And I'm not an engineer, so I can't tell you how that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| and I don't know if it's a single blast or the cumulative effect of blasting over a period of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| But it's a concern when you're starting to talk about where you're going to bury veterans and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| Some of them will be buried in concrete burial vaults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| and if foundations or pools will crack, those can crack too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| What we are concerned about is those kinds of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| Now, there has been an environmental impact study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| It was finished about the middle of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| and for the first time this afternoon I was able to get a copy of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| and they were generously provided by the engineers that did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| It's 300 pages long, and I can tell you I have not finished reading it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| But we have questions about even the process that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| I'm here today not to ask that this project be disapproved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| but to ask the city council to slow the process down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| that there's, in 30 days, there are things that we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| that could potentially satisfy the concerns of our veterans in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| As a leader of our organization, I could commit that we would go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| and pin people down about exactly what damage they're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| when it occurred and what the circumstances are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| and present statements that could be verified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| I don't believe that there's been people that are involved in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| that have been on that site when an explosion or a blasting has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| I have been out to the site several times, and it's not occurred while I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| I'd like to be on that site at a time that blasting occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| so we can know what the impact is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| The studies that have been done dealt with data from a company that works for the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| That causes us some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| It was quoted in the paper today that there wasn't time for independent verification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| because the study had to be done by this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| Independent verification should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| It may all turn out to be accurate, but it needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| So those are the kinds of issues that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| At the meeting last night, several of you council members were kind enough to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| I think you could all agree that there was some pretty strong emotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| and the emotion last night was directed somewhat at the site itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| and some was at being left out of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| I can speak to the American Legion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| I can't speak to every veterans organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| We were first contacted around October 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| and we were asked from Nashville to attend a meeting in front of your organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| that was going to occur I think on October 28 at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| The call went to the district commander, Marty Everett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| who then sent emails out, and he sends out hundreds of emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| and we had a group committed to come to that meeting so we could learn about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| We didn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| We didn't know what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| We could start to ask our questions at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| Either the day before or the day of that hearing, we got another call from Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| saying that Commissioner Keyes was no longer going to be appearing for the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| that the project was not going to be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| and that we would be needed about three months down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| which I think is today, and we were told not to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| We did not come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| I had it on my calendar to be here because we were interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| That's the contact that we've had from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| I learned last night for the first time that the environmental study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| tried to reach us maybe in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| and they have a list of veterans groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| They sent out letters asking for comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| Our post is on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| They got addresses off the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| The address they got is our street address where we don't get mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| So we never got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| If we'd gotten it, we'd have responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| This is an important issue to all the veterans in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| It's the veterans that are going to be buried in that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| The veterans should be involved from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| I can't tell you from what I've learned in the short period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| when this process started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| All of you are much more involved in governmental process than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| and you know these things happen over a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| We first learned very late in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| and we have never, these 30 sites narrowed to six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| we have no idea where any of those are at because we've never been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| We believe that it's in the best interest of the veterans of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| the citizens of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| to slow this process down just a very short time, 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| let us do certain things that we'll bring back to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| We'll share them with the engineers, share them with the people in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| and get the answers so that there's a good chance that the veterans will join and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| This is very nice because it is a beautiful piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| but there are concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Further questions from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| I have two questions, and the first one is for Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| To address Judge Irvine's question about a 30-day postponement of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4332)|
| 1:12:20| what does that do to the possibility of this situation being resolved in its current form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4340)|
| 1:12:31| Councilmember Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| you would create a difficulty not only for the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| as Commissioner Keyes has talked about from the standpoint of their federal timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| and being ready with an expansion area for the cemetery by August of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4361)|
| 1:12:49| To our situation, our option expires, I believe, March 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| and so we're now really beginning to squeeze the time frame that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| in order to get everything done to have the closing relative to that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| and get the state free to move forward with their plans as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| So it would be a pretty significant complication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| And my second question is for Commissioner Keyes, if you would, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| Could you ultimately, I think everybody on this council wants to do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| to honor our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| All of us are incredibly thankful and respectful of that service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| and sacrifice that these individuals have given to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| And ultimately, the decision about locating a piece of property to honor our veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4415)|
| 1:13:43| and its suitability is up to your department within the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| So can you tell us a little bit more about how you came to this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| and then how you utilize public process with the veterans groups in making a site selection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| Is it something that you can involve the groups in when you're down to six finalists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| or is the reality that the involvement comes at a different juncture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| What are your criteria for an appropriate and honorable site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| and then how do you go about involving the public in those decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| Councilman Dee, the process, and if I could be perfectly frank with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| the process really began for this expansion in 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| If you want to talk about it, this is when we acquired the initial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| where we currently are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| So the process, we knew that one day that we were going to be expanding this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| because we knew that the current site had a life expectancy in terms of first-time internments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| approximately 20 years from where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| And we will be, say, at August of 2011 or late 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| So that's actually what's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| And when I look at it, when I came into office in 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| this is something that I knew that I was going to have to be faced with probably before my term was up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| And so in terms of the process, it is something that I look at my cemetery director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| my administrator, maybe every few months I'm looking at where are we in terms of burials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| How has our rate of burials been through this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| What are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| We need to be starting the process of expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| We can't wait until the end of it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| because there are a lot of steps that we're going through and we've been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| in order to make sure that when this cemetery closes, we make that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| We want to close this one day and we want to move the next day into the new site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| without losing any time at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| And that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| Now, as far as having input, you will not find a greater advocate for veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| than I am for the veterans in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| I've been in this business a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| I've been involved with all of the cemeteries from my previous work on through now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| As far as involvement with them in terms of I think our QE and doing the environmental studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4567)|
| 1:16:18| that's really at the time that they sent out the notice to area veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| to inform them of what was going on to solicit their input in terms of if they had any suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4584)|
| 1:16:32| or whatever about what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| Let them know where we are, what we're doing, and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Now, as far as having them in from the beginning, no, they were not in from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| because that lies within my purview in terms of what I do and what the department does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| and making sure that these are just day-to-day kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| And veteran organizations, as much as I work with them, they are not in on my day-to-day operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| You know, that's part of what I have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| And the worst thing that I could have done when I found out that the site that we were trying to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| and had been expecting to move to all the time was sit down and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| excuse me, and rub my feet and come to Knox County and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| ladies and gentlemen, veterans of this community, at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| the cemetery on Lyons View is going to be closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| We do not have an alternate site in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| and the veterans of East Tennessee will not have a place to bury their loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| Had I not done what I felt was within my purview to do in terms of looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| and moving forward with finding an alternative site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| working with Washington, going to Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| to secure the approval for the new site, which we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| and which really I was surprised to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| normally they do not approve two cemeteries in the same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| Now, this is a totally new site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| We started off, we thought it was an expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| This is not an expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| This is a new site altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| We will have everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| This is a whole new cemetery just like the one on Lyons View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| The only thing that we will be doing on Lyons View once this site closes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| would be second internments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| On this new site, all of the internments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| everything will be handled from that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| So that's really a totally new site, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| I do not know of another city, another state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| that has two state veterans' cemeteries in the same city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| It is unprecedented as far as I know, and I've been around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| So that process, now as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| and if my fellow veterans somewhat feel like they've been left out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4721)|
| 1:18:49| they were not left out of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| They were afforded that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| If the mailings went out to an address that was inaccurate on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| that's the, it is their responsibility to update their website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| to make sure we have the proper location, the proper timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| and the proper way of addressing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| And, you know, I'm sorry that they feel that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| but we are at a process, we're at a point where we are looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| as this is something that's good for the city, it's good for the veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| and I think once we get past this juncture tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| and once this area is developed, I think it will be pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| I think everybody, all veterans in this area will be totally pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| with what we have been able to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Commissioner McGreeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| In response to the letters that were sent out, how many responses did you receive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4775)|
| 1:19:44| Let me ask Ms. Henning to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| Could I ask Ms. Henning to respond to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| If you just, for the record, give us your name and address, too, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| My name is Helen Henning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| My address is 7919 Bell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| I live in the Halls community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| My company performed the environmental assessment that was done in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| to the National Environmental Policy Act because of the federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| As part of that process, we notified 32 different veterans' organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| in this local region, Knox and surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| In fact, we have brought a list of them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| We've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| You have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Anyway, what I have put in that little package is a copy of the template letter that we sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| to those various veterans' groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| I think it's the last one in the package because I wasn't sure what all I would have to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| But of those 32 groups that we sent those letters to, we had three written responses back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4843)|
| 1:20:53| and a total of six comments altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| We had three of those get returned in the mail because we had a wrong address that was incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| on a website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| But in general, I feel like the veterans were notified in mid-November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4864)|
| 1:21:13| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| Councilman Roddy asked my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| I'd like to make a comment that I am a veteran and I will probably be buried in the Veterans' Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4881)|
| 1:21:29| I hope to live long enough to be buried in the new cemetery wherever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| But my question is directed to Judge Irvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| I want to ask him a question while he's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| If you have requested a delay to slow the process down, you've heard the commissioner say if that's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4901)|
| 1:21:49| it's going to be some years before a new cemetery exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| And people who die will have to go to their bodies will be sent to Chattanooga, Johnson City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| or wherever, or a private burial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| Are you all right with that process if this is voted down tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4925)|
| 1:22:12| How do you feel about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Well, again, we're not asking you to vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| We're asking for a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| If you have a delay, that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| How do you feel about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| I feel about it that I can't respond because the first time I heard that was at the meeting yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| when we were told, we're here to listen to you, but we're not going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| We don't have any way to look into that like the entire rest of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| I've had my involvement with government and you're involved with government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| The project this magnitude, a 30-day delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| it could be delayed for any number of reasons for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| There's very few projects that money disappears based on a 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| We think that it's very possible at the end of the 30 days we would come back to this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| and to the commissioner and say we support this project 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| But right now, you were at the meeting last night, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| and you saw the reaction of each and every group there as far as the commissioner says it's not their fault,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| that addresses are wrong on a website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| Our address is not wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| We have our street address and our PO box on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| so that people can find out where we are for meetings and can send us mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| We don't think this was an intentional thing on the people that did the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| We don't think it's an intentional thing on the commissioner's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| Commissioner Keyes is a friend of Tennessee veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| We're not trying to make this about Commissioner Keyes at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| But we believe that there's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| It's nice to hear, and I hear it all the time, that we want to honor our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| We'd rather be honored a little less and listen to a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| If you want to honor us, get us involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| This has been going on since 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| We should have been involved since 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| We do it with lots of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| It's not a day-to-day operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| We don't want to micromanage what the commissioner does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| He's got plenty to do without worrying about us looking over his shoulder on everything he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| But this is a long-term project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| And in this project, and if there's other projects in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| they're going to have this kind of impact on Tennessee veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| Part of the process should begin very early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| Certainly not so late in the project that we have no impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| that we're told, take it or leave it, or we won't bury you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| And we want a chance to look at it and be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| Well, thank you for your comments, but in listening to what the commissioner said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5082)|
| 1:24:50| and what Mr. Martin has said, if this is not voted up pretty soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| there's going to be a period of time where people will have to go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| This is one of the problems, so to speak, as I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| Mr. Brown, we take two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| I heard you make a special meeting when I sat here and listened to the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| decide about somebody's beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| We'd ask for the same consideration to have time to be heard and ask for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| And we'll do the same work we do in 30 days in a period of two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| I have two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Well, it's me, so they're probably not quick questions for Commissioner Keyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| I actually was driving out to the site on Saturday and went through the industrial park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| and thought this is really kind of ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| I know when we buried my dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| I don't think I would have wanted to drive through that or to go visit him there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| The city's had some success in our Broadway central corridor doing grants for facade improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| saying, you know, if a property owner is going to put a little money up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| we'll put some money up to make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| Do you all have anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| Or is that something you could even consider for making what is now not a very pretty highway better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| Could you even work with the county about getting something like that done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| We're open to suggestions along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| I think when we finish with the property, it's going to be a beautiful site in terms of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| As far as the ingress along certain lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| I think probably a landscape architect would look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| I can be dealing with city, I mean the county, whomever, in terms of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| and trying to beautify the interests along some of the exterior parts of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| But the property itself will be something that all can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| I mean, it's an interesting thing to think about because it's not a pretty stretch of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| My other question sort of goes to this level of a delay right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| And I hear you when you talk about a delay on our part is not productive to getting this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5218)|
| 1:27:05| But I guess I sort of have a question of bureaucracies don't move particularly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| And all we're voting on tonight is, as I understand this, Mr. Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| we're going to buy the property and sell it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| And my bet is that until all the paperwork gets signed on that, it's a little ways from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| And I'm wondering, you know, what happens if Mr. Irvine does his study and they go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| and they find an engineer who comes back and said, oh, my God, this whole site is a giant sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| Do you all have provisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| Are you sort of stuck putting a cemetery there if we know it's unusable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| Is there anything between now and, you know, two weeks from now that if somebody gave you information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5262)|
| 1:27:51| that said this is an absolutely horrible site, would you be able to put the brakes on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5271)|
| 1:27:58| Would I be able to put the brakes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| We've already done all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| We've already done all the assessments we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| We know what the property has on it, all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| We've taken measures to work around those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| So we know what is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| We know what we've got to look at in terms of maybe unusable areas within floodplains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| and possibly all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| So really, I don't know that a study could be done in two weeks from today by any environmental assessment team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5300)|
| 1:28:29| to do that because I don't know what time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| How long did it take us to do currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| It took us two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| It took them two months to do the study for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| And that's quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| And we don't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| We don't have two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| I'm not sure who it was, so I'll just work my way down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| I guess I'm not sure who this is addressed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| I don't think it's Commissioner Keyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| It may be Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| It may be you, Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Go ahead and ask, and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| The question is about process as well as deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| And I hear Judge Irvine saying, we'd like to be more engaged than we have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5346)|
| 1:29:13| We're playing beat the clock with our option, which we don't want to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| Is two weeks critical or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| Because if it's not, it seems like some ability to be engaged is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| If it damages this, then I see the city, in essence, almost wasting a million dollars on things we're going to do at Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5366)|
| 1:29:35| to tear down buildings and everything under our existing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| That seems like a terrible decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| But if we have two weeks of fat in this, can we accommodate more engagement by the veteran community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5381)|
| 1:29:50| And someone who knows the logistics has to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| Larry, you want to take a swing at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| The logistics of this are, one, from what we understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| and having worked with the state now for several months in regard to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| that this is a process that's behind today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| They've got a very, very narrow window in order to accomplish this and have a cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5412)|
| 1:30:19| whether it be an expansion or a new cemetery, opened August of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| And so time is of essence here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| The second part is that our option on the property, the city has the option on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| The option expires March 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| This is our third, I guess, extension of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| The owners have been very patient with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| They have worked with us along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| They're excited about this property being a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| But I would be remiss if I didn't remind council that our role here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5456)|
| 1:31:03| and our objective here is to obtain and to keep for Lakeshore a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5463)|
| 1:31:10| That has been our objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| That has been the responsibility that we have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| In trying to fulfill that responsibility, we were asked by the state to assist them in an alternate site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5475)|
| 1:31:23| And I can tell you that work was pretty exhaustive because Lee Miracle was involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| I was involved in it to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| All heavy lifting was done by people like Lee Miracle and Mike Fowler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| and others who looked at a multitude of different pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| And this is no easy matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| There are lots of requirements, restrictions, things that are necessary for cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| You can have only a certain amount of slope to it, all of those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| Sinkholes around here are very common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| So trying to find property that didn't have sinkholes, those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| Finding property that was of sufficient size that was affordable was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| We also knew we had a tight timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| So if the property wasn't on the market, then that was going to be an added complication as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5532)|
| 1:32:20| And as far as big tracks of property, those are difficult to deal on a 400-acre track of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5540)|
| 1:32:27| when you're only looking for 50 or 60 acres of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| So there are all of those sort of things that went into this that led to this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| Once we got there and turned that decision over to the state, that's been the state's project from that point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5558)|
| 1:32:48| Once they made the selection that this is their property, they went through the testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| We couldn't move forward on negotiating the deal, the transaction, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| until they were in a position to feel comfortable from an environmental standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| which took a good bit of time, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| But that's just the nature of the beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| It wasn't a case of anybody dragging their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| It's just that it takes that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| It has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| This is an agreement that goes back to the 90s that has lots of moving pieces to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5594)|
| 1:33:22| I can assure you Debbie and I have spent and Sharon Boyce have spent a good bit of time going through the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5602)|
| 1:33:30| and making the amendments to this document to make this transaction work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| So I think we're at a good spot, a spot that everything that needs to be done has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5614)|
| 1:33:42| And we have time now to get this finalized, get it closed by the March 1 date so the state can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5622)|
| 1:33:49| And I think the state has done a really good job in their due diligence with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| And I think if you've been out there and seen the site, it's a beautiful location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| I don't see the industrial issue of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| It's not, you know, John Sevier Highway has areas that are not as pretty as perhaps you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5645)|
| 1:34:14| But when you look at this site from across the river, it's a beautiful site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| When you're on the site and look back toward the river, I didn't see a rock quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| I saw a rock bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| And it's a beautiful piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| So I've gone to editorializing and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| It was a great statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| And I guess the question is, and I realize the key point you made to me was that we're not in the veteran cemetery business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5673)|
| 1:34:41| that that's something that the state agency is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| I guess the only question I had was, what happens logistically if you lose two weeks on your timetable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5685)|
| 1:34:53| recognizing that we're not, I don't think people making this decision can make everyone happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| no matter what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| And I think we have to be prudent about the city's fisc and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| I'm concerned about this piece of property leaving our hands and getting the job done if we go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| If we lose two weeks, what does that do to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| Well, it, Councilman DeLavope, it just creates a real crunch time to get everything done from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5713)|
| 1:35:23| that would be February 9th if you're talking about postponing it two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| Postponing it two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| Three weeks left to get the closing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| To get the closing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| And you know how many moving parts there can be in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| And that could be risky relative to the property and the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| Vice Mayor Becker, one of the things to consider when you go out there is to go the other way into the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5745)|
| 1:35:52| It's a much different environment as you drive into the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| It seems to me after listening to the folks last night at the meeting and listening tonight that it seems to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5757)|
| 1:36:05| one of the biggest problems we have is that we have a group of people who feel disenfranchised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| that they weren't made a part of the decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| Now, granted, there was an effort to try and contact people by letters and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| And part of my question, Mr. Martin, is the fact that can we proceed with the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5779)|
| 1:36:26| because I realize what we're interested in is the park and not losing that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| But I would ask the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| The one gentleman said that they probably would not be against or opposed to that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| but they would at least like the opportunity to discuss it maybe further with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| and maybe do some of their own checking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| Is it possible that we proceed and that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| and whoever have several workshops that you really sit down with the veterans and talk to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| I know in dealing with neighborhoods, a lot of times if we present the issue up front and early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| and bring the people on board, it certainly makes it a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| And I don't know whether in the next couple of weeks this could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| I think it's part of what Councilman Della Vope is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| So would that be possible and would that be agreeable with the folks from the standpoint of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| again, getting more input into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| And I also, the other part of my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| I'd be curious as to the three responses, Helen, that you did get, what those three responses were on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5845)|
| 1:37:36| In two weeks' time, first of all, I don't know what's going to be done within two weeks' time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| that has not already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| If they are talking about doing a study, who's going to pay for the study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| What we've spent already is a couple hundred thousand dollars on our study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| We've done an archaeological study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| We've done a geotechnical study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| We've done a wetland floodplain study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| We've done a threatened and endangered species study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| Now, is that going to be done in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| I mean, so I'm not opposed to inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5887)|
| 1:38:15| I very much agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| But I just don't see what two weeks is going to do other than set us back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| and possibly put us in a position to lose this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| The worst thing that can happen, Councilman, is for this cemetery to close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| if we not have a cemetery to bury our veterans in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| Now, if they are willing to accept this, you know, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| I don't want to be saying that because I did not do my due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| in ensuring that the veterans of East Tennessee had an honorable place to bury their veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5928)|
| 1:38:55| I don't want to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| So, you know, unless someone can assure me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| Really, I'm trying to see what would be done in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| Well, I think what I got a telephone call this afternoon from a veteran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| who's also very much involved in cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| And his questions were asked in terms of geological studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| and this sort of thing, what had been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| And my understanding is this has been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| Same thing with archaeology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| And he was satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| He just had some questions that he wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| And then he said, well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| And so what I'm saying or possibly proposing is that we can still move along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| if the group's agreeable and yet still spend some time with these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| to let them know what has happened with the geology studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| and the archaeology studies and the concerns that they do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| In other words, just have them be more of a part if it's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| within the next couple of weeks on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| And I guess the question would also go to them in terms of whether that would be, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| In other words, I'm looking for a way that they can really buy into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| Now, again, I realize it's not our responsibility in terms of a cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| but we do have a responsibility to our veterans and the people and the citizens here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| to be concerned about what the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| So I'd ask the same question to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| Judge, would you like to make a quick comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| The question asked is what can we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| And I tried to lay out some of the ideas we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| as far as we can go out and find hard evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| We can't do a geological study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| It's not what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| But we can go out and the people that are giving us these stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| about what happened, we can pin them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| Are you talking about something that happened 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| when somebody else was doing a different kind of blasting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| Or is it going on now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| And, you know, make sure they're willing to come forward and say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| We can go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| Mr. Gamble is here with AgriUSA, the company that runs that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| I talked to him earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| He's willing to let us come out there when they blast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| so we can see for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| Those are the kinds of things we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| We certainly are interested in whatever time we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| to have some input in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| What concerns me is what I heard last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| and what I'm hearing here today from our people in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| is that, you know, it's going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| And your only choice is you want to have a place to bury people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| or you'll take this site and be happy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| The problems that will arise will arise in two or three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| because there are problems with the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| and the veterans have been listened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| And it will be the next governor that has to deal with the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| of people that are unhappy being forced into a cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| that we opposed and weren't listened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| And then could we get the responses, Helen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| Excuse me, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| I didn't mean to be so informal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| You're doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| We've worked together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| The three letters that we got for responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| are from Sevier County American Legion Post No. 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| These letters are short, so if it's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| I'll just read the pertinent sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| After the introductory stuff, this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| which is from Jim Miller of Sevier County American Legion Post 104,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| says, Speaking for the veterans of the American Legion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| of Sevierville, Tennessee, we fully support this new cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| Time will wait for none of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| and the need for additional cemetery space in our area is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| We wish you success in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| The next letter is from the Veterans of Foreign Wars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| Blount County Memorial Post 5154 in Louisville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| And this one says the members of this post strongly support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| While this location seems to offer a beautiful area for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| an area closer to the populace would be a better site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| Having said this, we also understand that modern-day commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| and residential development probably makes this site the most ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| Again, we fully support this project and your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| The last letter is from the Office of Veteran Services in Scott County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| And this letter says, he apologizes for his late response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| but he says, Please pass on to whomever needs it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| my wholehearted support for this much-needed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| I only wish it were located in my county, Scott County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| As we know, the death rate for World War II veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| is at an unfortunately high rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| and a lot will request burial in our state's veteran cemeteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| to which they are already or soon will be at capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| Then will come our Korea and Vietnam veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| who are also deserving of these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| As an outlying county to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| approximately 75 miles one way from county seat to county seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| Scott County to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| this cemetery would undoubtedly be utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| for our veterans and families for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| Also, I am very familiar with this proposed site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| and think it would be a beautiful and serene area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| We also have in the audience Mr. Charles Staley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| who is the service officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| with the Department of Veterans Affairs from Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| and he received our letter as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| if you care to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| Was that a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| You would like to hear from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Okay, Councilman Grief would like to hear from you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6275)|
| 1:44:41| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| I'm Charles Staley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| I live in Maryville, Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| Let me make myself a Knox County person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| I was born out here off Island Home Park in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| Welcome home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Started the school in 1939 at the old Perkins School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| down in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| so that makes me a city of Knoxville person, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| So I'm not altogether a Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| I've lived there most of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| I was 11 years old when we moved to Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| Formerly, we were in the monument business, tombstone business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| and my family spent 47 years, 32 of those 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| I ran the monument company myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| and I'm very familiar with cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| Now, most of the cemeteries are not put in like on a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| They don't put the cemeteries out in the plant land that is fertile for crops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| They generally put it over in the poor section of the place, which is not for crops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6338)|
| 1:45:45| Now, this is the old tradition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| and, of course, the new traditions probably wouldn't be a whole lot different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| if the cemetery can be put in a spot like that and be beautified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| which I understand this property can be beautified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| In the case of this land in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| evidently it has the approval of the zoning that would be necessary in any case for the use of this cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6364)|
| 1:46:13| What has to be considered in more desirable property would be taking off the property tax road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| forever this land to be used for a cemetery versus the desirable land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| for property that would increase the property tax on any improvements made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| and to which the city or county or both base their funds to operate their government expenses for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| Now, I ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| If you owned property with a very nice home out in any residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6401)|
| 1:46:49| and someone planned to put a cemetery right up against your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| what would your reaction be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| Think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Probably not very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| I was at the legislative meeting when an understanding representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| I think his name was Ray McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| had in the old city county or the old building prior to the city county building being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| which was just adjacent to this, in 1975 or 76.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| That's when this all started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| when we first had notification that the National Cemetery over on Cooper Street was filling up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6443)|
| 1:47:32| and they needed to involve the state in securing a new cemetery for that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6452)|
| 1:47:40| It took 15 years from 1975 to 1990 for the first burial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6460)|
| 1:47:48| Now, that's what you're faced with, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| if we lose the rights that the federal has already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| And should they back away from this and start anew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| you're looking at 10 or 15 years with no place to bury us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| And by 10 or 15 years, I'm going to be deceased more than likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| and probably most of us will be deceased that are veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| Where are we going to be buried?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| We sure won't be buried in a veteran's cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| if we have to back away from this after two years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6494)|
| 1:48:25| Give me a moment to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| You have about 30 more seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| What we have here is a go-ahead situation without having to wait another 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| which was already stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| Most of us will be deceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| We're asking the city to actually approve this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6520)|
| 1:48:46| and go on with it while it's fresh on the board without any delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| As far as some of the complaints of last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| I was at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| I said nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| I did listen a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| and that's what I'm supposed to do as county veterans affairs service officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| for the last 24 years in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| As far as the blasting from the quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| I used to live next to a quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| I lived at a meat quarry where they used to do a blast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| and occasionally you would hear a boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| It wasn't all that noticeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| The 21-gun salute would make more noise at each of the funerals out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| than that one boom would make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| The land out there that is now vacant without any greenery around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6565)|
| 1:49:32| you know there is a used car or a big car lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| a huge car lot out there on that highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| that you would never know that there was a car lot out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| due to the fact that they have greenery around it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| and that's planned for this cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| If you all would notice the plans for the outward area of the cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6586)|
| 1:49:52| the highway is big enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| There's nothing wrong with the Governor Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| It's very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| The noise of the trucks were going to be hidden partly by the greenery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| and the barrier around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| The dust off of the quarry is limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| It's pure lime, and lime sweetens the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| There's nothing wrong with a little bit of dust occasionally getting over in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| You're just about out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| You probably need to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| Please pass on this and go ahead and approve it tonight, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| This won't take very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| Commissioner Keyes, I wanted to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| First of all, I want to thank you for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| and being an advocate for the veterans and thank all the veterans for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| You do these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| You have a lot on your plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| and I'm wondering when you get to this stage where we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| is this similar to what goes on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| I mean, you know, when this first came to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| here we are sitting sort of in almost an appeal setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| and I asked the question, are we discussing this with our local veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| And I know I've heard all the things that have gone on, the mailings and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| and there's still a few veterans out there that have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| But from your standpoint, you do these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| You're down to the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| Is this similar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| In terms of I haven't had to do a cemetery expansion in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| In fact, this is the first really cemetery expansion we had to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| because we've got adequate land in Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| We've got 250 acres in Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| In Nashville, I think we've got 220 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| and we have segments of that developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| So normally these are the kinds of things that when we do, we involve veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| It's not, like I said, we want to have their input because it does affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| And like I said, being a veteran myself, I understand their concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| and if they feel like they have been disallowed in this whole process, I apologize to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| And I think they understand that it was not, if it was perceived that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| it was not intended to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| This is just a process that we've been moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| The attempts were made to contact them through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| and many of them, they did not receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| It is unfortunate that they did not receive those correspondence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| and we really look forward to their input and look forward to their support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| as we move to bring this into fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| Well, you know, this is such a beautiful piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| and it should be just a totally 100 percent completely positive experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| and I'm just sort of sad to see a few folks are not happy that they weren't informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| At the end, I think they will be pleasantly pleased with everything that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| Thank you very much for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| I wanted to see Harold Woods standing up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| and I just wanted to recognize him real briefly for whatever comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| whatever wisdom you can give us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| My name is Harold Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| I live at 412 Moody Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| I lived in Knoxville all my life, south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| I was born and raised in a place called Meade's Quarry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| where all the blasting was taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| I lived there almost all my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| and I will say that anyone that thinks blasting don't affect the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| it certainly does by living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| And to not give veterans, and I'm a veteran, but not give veterans two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6806)|
| 1:53:33| I know that they're on the crunch and the push and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| but two weeks for us to take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| and if that company decides that they don't want a blast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| some of us will go to that company and say, give us one blast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| Let us feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| Let us see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| And I guarantee we'll support that place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| but we want to know exactly what is going to affect the veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| We deserve that, and we should have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| So to give a—I was for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| I wasn't going to speak to that, but I was for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| But I'll go with two weeks, but that don't change the whole world in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| but you give us veterans an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| I'm going to move the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| Mayor, if I'm not out of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| I know that the general manager of the place that does the blasting is sitting out there in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6867)|
| 1:54:34| Would it be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| If you would like to do that, that's perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| Sit down and give us some comments on the blasting, how often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| and just a few brief comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| If you could give us your name and address and maybe your affiliation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| Eric Gamble with Aggregates USA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| We're at 2209 Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| We generally blast on average about once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| In our busier times, obviously, everybody knows the economy is not good right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| so we're basically about every other week in this current state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| When things pick back up, summertime or busy time, we may be twice a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| but on average throughout the year, about once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| I feel that we can work with the cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| that if there are services to manage our blasting around those services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| so we're not disrupting those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Obviously, we do have to blast to do our business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| so in those times, we're going to have to pull shots to break the rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6925)|
| 1:55:31| In my experience with our seismograph that we use a third party to take readings for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| we're under a lot of restrictions from the state as well as, you know, the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| We're well below those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| We pride ourselves on being below those standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| and those readings were provided through the environmental study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6947)|
| 1:55:54| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| Councilman Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| I have a question concerning the rock bluffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| When I was out there, I noticed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| of course from the site looking across the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| and the rock bluffs are really quite natural and beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| Will the bluffs stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| I mean, as far as where your quarry is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| I mean, I couldn't tell when I was out there looking at the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| I mean, there's no intention of taking the rocks down at the river?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6972)|
| 1:56:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| With our current permits, we cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| We have a – I believe it's at least a 200-foot offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| It might be a 300-foot offset on those bluffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| On those bluffs, so we have to stay that far back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| We have a general – our permit boundaries are 200 feet off any property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| And then a question to Helen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| Did you actually do a test when they did a blast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| What was the results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| We started our study in November, about November the 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| and when I told you that we worked for two months to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| that was absolutely night and day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| And anyway, by the time we got to where we recognized that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| the quarry was an issue, both for noise and for vibration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| we contacted the quarry about the 1st of December for a blasting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| And just because of the condition of the economy and the Christmas season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| they did not blast at all in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| So we were not able to do independent monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| At that point, they informed us that they used a company called Sal's Seismic Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7038)|
| 1:57:24| to do their third-party monitoring, and we contacted that company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| and got any data that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| They had data going back to March of 2009, and both from a vibration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| and from a noise standpoint, that data is completely acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| Were there any interviews of the neighbors in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| While we were out there in the course of performing the archaeological work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| and wetlands and floodplains, the other studies on the site, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| we took the opportunity to talk to some of the particularly adjacent property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| as well as a couple people from across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| By no means can we represent that we spoke to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| but essentially the people that are out there have lived with that for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| And while I heard stories that the windows used to rattle, you know, and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| there were no complaints within recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| And one thing that the seismic company informed us of is that they were actually brought on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| in March of 2009 to help Aggregate USA tailor their blasting plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7108)|
| 1:58:36| so that they would be more effective while minimizing offsite effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7116)|
| 1:58:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| I was going to move the discussion to the second part in terms of the city's agreement with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| because, like I said, they're – but if somebody would like to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| go ahead and make a motion on this, obviously you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| but the intention was to discuss both of them and then vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| So later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| So that's where I'm going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| There are some proposed amendments, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| Ms. Poplar, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| In terms of representing the people in the 4th District and the people of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| I see this proposal as a wiser use of the money that's involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7160)|
| 1:59:28| and that we gain from that the land at Lakeshore that is very hard to come by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7168)|
| 1:59:34| and is in the center of our population and providing a great park resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7174)|
| 1:59:40| And to think that we might be spending this money to tear down a building just to make way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7180)|
| 1:59:46| on a rocky slope for a cemetery doesn't make much sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| And then we heard statements to the effect that maybe the National Veterans Affair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| wouldn't even want that site at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| So in terms of economics, this is a smart deal for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| And if we're talking about the second part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| it's certainly something I think that warrants our careful consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7204)|
| 2:00:10| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| In response to your question, Mayor, my preference would be to consider this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| and vote on this and then move to the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| But I don't know what the preference is of the rest of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| Anybody just want to chime in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| We can handle it either way, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| It's obviously your prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| I guess we'll go ahead and move approval of 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| There are some amendments that have to happen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| And just we can come back to the discussion, but I just want to be clear, as Ms. Poplin said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7238)|
| 2:00:48| David, would you like to read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| I'll go ahead and address these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| The first amendments are actually in the resolution itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| and it's being proposed just for a clarification for the 17 acres surrounding the cottage properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7256)|
| 2:01:08| I didn't know if Mr. Martin wanted to address this portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| There are we have, as you know, the two resolutions, 11C and 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| 11C deals with the actual purchase of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| It references, though, this additional or second 17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7285)|
| 2:01:32| That's also part and parcel of the amendment to the 99 agreement that's covered in Resolution 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7292)|
| 2:01:41| So what this represents is really this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| I didn't think about the fact we'd have to, Debbie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| talk about this section first before we got into all of the other amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7308)|
| 2:01:54| So it might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| I don't know what the protocol here is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| If we could talk about what are the amendments to the original amendment to the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7318)|
| 2:02:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| If that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| And the bulk of those are associated with 11D, not 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| I think that's probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| Ms. Pubby, do you want to give us some guidance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| That is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| And what I can do, I can just go through the changes that I've put in your revised packets this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| and go through the changes from what you saw from Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| On D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| On D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| Would it be helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| And, Mr. Swanson, let me ask your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| To amend my motion to approve 11C to do an approval of 11C and 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7356)|
| 2:02:42| I mean, I know that's a possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| Would that help move things forward to get us considering them all together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| It's possible to consider them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| Although, if somebody doesn't want it to be done that way, they could move to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| And that would have a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| Generally, under our rules, a question should be divided if someone wants it to be divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| So the answer to your question is, yes, they can be considered together if you want to make a joint motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7383)|
| 2:03:10| But if anybody wants to do it separately, then it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| Well, it almost seems that the idea that Mr. Haslam had of talking about them together makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| knowing that what we've got on our plate is C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| We're talking about we're getting into talking about D now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| So we're getting into the use agreement a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| If everybody understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| I'm going to probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| That was the direction I was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| And I know Ms. Roddy said she'd like to maybe go ahead and separate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| And anybody else want to express, just to prep without a long discussion, express a preference for how we deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| Is there a reason not to go ahead and vote on 11C before we get into the various amendments in the NIAID agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7430)|
| 2:03:59| that are contained in 11D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| And I understand that they are intertwined, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| I mean, bottom line, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| There's nothing legally that would stop us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| I can't think of any dangerous territory that takes us in, if that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7449)|
| 2:04:13| That was my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| And we have a motion on the floor for 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| We do have a motion on the floor to approve 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| Well, I guess we also need a motion to amend 11C as reflected in the black line version we were given today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7461)|
| 2:04:28| which is some changes that actually reflect how it relates with 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| So was that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| There was a motion to amend 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| It might be my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| If we approve 11C, which is to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| And turn down 11D, we're stuck with farmland, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7494)|
| 2:05:01| Well, I guess technically it's just authorizing me to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| So we wouldn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| I mean, it's authorizing the mayor to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| And so I hopefully would have the prudence not to buy it if we turn down D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| Well, I would assume so, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| But you don't want to give me too much credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| Technically, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| If we turn down D, I will not sign the contract to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| If we turn down D, I will not sign the contract to buy C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| Then there's a motion to amend in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| It's amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| Back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| Councilman Grieve, that's an old light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| Then there's a motion to amend 11C as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| Councilman Brown, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| Just a little clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| We're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| No, we actually approved the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| Now we're going to vote on the motion as amended with the black-lined copy that you got in 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| The motion carries 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| Now we'll move to 11D, which has already been read by Ms. Mitchell, if I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| So we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| We can move to discussing 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| I'll make a motion to approve to get things started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| Ms. Poplin, do we need to make some amendments here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| Yes, there are proposed amendments that were in the package you received this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| And I could just go through quickly the changes you will see from what you received Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| and what you received this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| Mainly they're for clarification purposes, but there are a few substantive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| Beginning with what's numbered as paragraph 8, you will see on that change the clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| is that if the state builds a new mental health facility, then we will relocate the walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7633)|
| 2:07:20| trail to an area within Lakeshore that will be mutually agreed to by the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| and that will reasonably connect these certain two tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| Moving to paragraph 10, this eliminates the city's responsibility to widen Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| and to add a traffic signal, but it maintains the city's responsibility to construct an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7658)|
| 2:07:44| entrance road from the North Shore Drive area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| Paragraph 13 reflects a similar change that you will see back above in paragraph 8 regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| the relocation of the walking trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| It was just recited in that paragraph as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| In section 14, this changes the time frame within which the city would demolish the Waterside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7681)|
| 2:08:09| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| It was originally six months, and that has been extended to one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| Moving to section 15, this is clarification on the demolitions of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7695)|
| 2:08:24| The reference to the steam plant and Keller buildings have been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| It maintains the responsibility for demolition of the maintenance buildings within a year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| time of notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| Moving to section 23, this is actually a more substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7717)|
| 2:08:45| In the original 1990 agreement, there was not a specific process as to how the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7725)|
| 2:08:55| would act once it's abandoned by the state, how it would be conveyed, and how much of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| the surrounding fee simple property around the buildings would be transferred to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| So we had worked on clarifying that process with this language, and what we came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| that you see here is that once the state provides notice to the city that they will be abandoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7751)|
| 2:09:18| or vacating a property, the city will then survey the building along with surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| areas so that the property will be feasible for the city's proposed use, and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| will submit that survey or property description to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| The state will not unreasonably withhold their approval of that, and then they will quit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| claim that property to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7780)|
| 2:09:46| In paragraph 25, this looks like a major change, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7786)|
| 2:09:50| It's actually just one word, and I apologize for striking the whole section and repeating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7790)|
| 2:09:55| it, but there was just some negotiation on the word of to provide and to propose an alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7795)|
| 2:10:03| site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| So it looks like originally the state had requested provide and then changed it to propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| and then they were back to provide now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| So that's the way the language will be in the final agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| Section 21 is another substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| There's a building on track 10, which is where the cemetery expansion is to be relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7821)|
| 2:10:27| The state still has some use for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| It's referred to as the laundry building or property warehouse, and they've asked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| continue use of that property until the end of this year, and that seemed reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7834)|
| 2:10:40| so we've included that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| At the end of this year, that property will be conveyed to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| Paragraph 28, this is to further clarify the procedure for the conveyance of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7848)|
| 2:10:56| because the state has already given us notice, as you'll see, back in 2008, that it intends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7856)|
| 2:11:02| to convey four buildings in track 13 to the city, and this is at the time we realized that the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7862)|
| 2:11:09| from 99 was not clear as to how much property around the building they would convey to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7869)|
| 2:11:16| So we've just recited in this that for these properties, we will go along with the procedure as contemplated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7876)|
| 2:11:23| and we will survey the property and submit the request to the state for what we desire to make it usable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| and they've agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| So those are the changes that are in this document from what we sent you on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7891)|
| 2:11:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| I see several lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| I'll start over here with Councilman Dalgopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| Debbie, do I understand the changes to 14 and thereabouts that we don't have to tear the water side building down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7905)|
| 2:11:52| unless the state decides they need that spot to build a new mental health facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7912)|
| 2:11:57| We're talking about the timing of the change and not the decision to tear it down like right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7917)|
| 2:12:03| We're not going to do that now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| I can, if I may respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| In the original agreement, the 99 agreement, it was required of us to take down the water side building in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7929)|
| 2:12:17| This postpones until and if and when they build either a mental health facility or another state facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7937)|
| 2:12:27| But it's contingent on them deciding to do something with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7947)|
| 2:12:30| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| Take the obligation off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| And then they give us notice, and we have a year to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| Ms. Poplin, does this agreement, this 1999 agreement as amended tonight and going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| does it have an expiration date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| Is there a time at which all of this unwinds, or is that completely dependent upon the state exercising their options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7968)|
| 2:12:57| And do they have a deadline by which they have to let the city know that they are exercising these options or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7977)|
| 2:13:04| Their deadlines are built within the different projects of the time frames of the notices that they have to give us and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7984)|
| 2:13:11| But there are not any hard and fast timelines for most of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| It's usually within so many years or months of notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| And within months of notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| But, for example, their ultimate decision whether or not to construct a new mental health facility or, I believe it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8001)|
| 2:13:28| or other state facility is an open-ended time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| So they have an unlimited time to decide how ultimately they would like to use the portion of the Lakeshore property that they are retaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8014)|
| 2:13:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8022)|
| 2:13:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| We did, Council Member Roddy, we did try to discuss that with the state and to set a time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8024)|
| 2:13:50| and they were not agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8030)|
| 2:13:54| If I could interject, I think I read somewhere in this packet that they've had this land since about the 1850s or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8034)|
| 2:14:00| It's not a new track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| I mean, they've had it and built upon it, but it's been a longstanding state property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8042)|
| 2:14:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| I've got two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| The first question is probably the easier one, which has to do with how many acres are actually located on the grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8053)|
| 2:14:20| and how many acres will the city actually own and how many do we lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| and what's the possibility of eventually having full ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8065)|
| 2:14:30| Larry, do you know the exact break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| I don't know that acreage breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| That's a good we can figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| The possibility is to have a full ownership at some point in time, I think, is I don't think anybody can know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8077)|
| 2:14:44| We still lease certain amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| We still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| I mean, I think the state obviously is, you know, making decisions all the time about what they're going to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8086)|
| 2:14:52| mental health facilities, where they're going to grow, not, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| They obviously have funding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| I think for any of us to even make an educated guess right there, it would just be a wild guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8097)|
| 2:15:04| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8104)|
| 2:15:05| We, of course, got 17 acres involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| They'll be ultimately land that would be conveyed with the cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| I think there was an original 59 acres or something like that when the first was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| There's been property transferred since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| And it would be just beyond that would be a guess as to how much we actually have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8122)|
| 2:15:30| But I have that on a chart somewhere, but not in this particular folder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| And maybe the more difficult question is for Mr. Martin to address item number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8135)|
| 2:15:41| So the first one was your easy question, and this is I didn't do well with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8141)|
| 2:15:48| This one has to do with the addition of including the permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| Thank you for asking that because I did want to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| And in all the discussion we've had here, we've gotten sidetracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| But we did add that there is a Paragraph 7 of the 1999 agreement that speaks to the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8162)|
| 2:16:13| And, as you know, the primary purpose of the property is for recreational use, public recreational use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8173)|
| 2:16:21| But Paragraph 7 anticipated the city having a desire to use it for other purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| And so it allows the city to use up to five acres for nonrecreational but public purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8188)|
| 2:16:38| as long as the noise or sound is not inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8198)|
| 2:16:45| It was our feeling that it's clear what public purpose could mean relative to a police station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8205)|
| 2:16:54| or something along those lines or the office for parks and recs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| But permanent supporting housing might not be obvious as a public purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8218)|
| 2:17:04| And so we thought that this was an opportunity to clarify that in this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8224)|
| 2:17:11| and ask the state to acknowledge that as an accepted public purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8231)|
| 2:17:16| And that is all we have done at this point is to get that acknowledgement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8236)|
| 2:17:21| and incorporate that as an accepted use for public purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| Now, if that is pursued by the ten-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| obviously that would be required to go through the public process that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8249)|
| 2:17:34| All of the due diligence and anything related to that ultimately would have to come before council for council's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8254)|
| 2:17:41| Well, I think that was the concern that several folks had was the fact that the process would still continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| that this is not necessarily a done deal that says that's going to be the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| and that they just wanted verification of that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| I think that's very accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| One of the footnotes of the conversation that's been going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| the first page of the 1999 agreement says there was 159 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8283)|

| 2:18:11| So that's the total triangle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8297)|
| 2:18:18| Then we're going to excuse me, Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| I'm going to make a motion to amend all the language that Ms. Poplin gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| We need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| No, I want you to say it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| And you know how quick I talk, so you want to stay up late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8310)|
| 2:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8314)|
| 2:18:35| There's a motion to amend with the language that Ms. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8319)|
| 2:18:48| I guess I understand the change in the language of this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8328)|
| 2:18:58| to clarify the public uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| I'm thinking out loud that we have a workshop already on council's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| relative to the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| and the use of permanent supportive housing to address homelessness in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8349)|
| 2:19:15| And I'm wondering if it would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| given the number of new members that we have in our body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| to delay adding this amendment to the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| until we have a chance to brief everybody on the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| and then go back and add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| I don't think ultimately it makes a huge difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| because I think a full public process will be conducted at such time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| that a specific plan is proposed for this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8383)|
| 2:19:48| and funding is obtained and there's all those hurdles to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| But given that we have five new members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| and that we have this workshop already scheduled for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| I see the urgency to go through with the other amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| that are presented to us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| But I'm wondering if there's not urgency on this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| if it would be prudent to allow that workshop to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| and then come back and add the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| which still doesn't obligate the creation of permanent supportive housing in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8415)|
| 2:20:21| It just opens that up as another site in our scattered site approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| to accommodate our priority for taking care of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8425)|
| 2:20:31| And I don't know if Larry or Debbie want to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| I think the issue is now while the agreement's open with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| to try to negotiate the contract and finish the contract with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| rather than go back and then ask them will they reopen it at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| Larry, Debbie, do you all want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8449)|
| 2:20:50| That's a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| That's a fair observation of where we are with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| I think there is some because of what we said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| because there was the time issue with the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| and I'm not going to sign the first until we agree on the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8459)|
| 2:21:04| We need to know we're back to the same time issue with the land purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| if we delay solving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| I think all that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| Mr. Mayor, I might add that 36 years of practicing law tells me that you negotiate a deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8473)|
| 2:21:19| when all the issues are on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| And if you put it off, you almost have no bargaining leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| Since this provision doesn't require any particular use but just permits it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8486)|
| 2:21:31| it's smart to get the option in there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| and trying to piecemeal negotiate little clauses ain't going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8494)|
| 2:21:39| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8499)|
| 2:21:40| I was just going to say that being a new council member that I don't have a problem with that going in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8500)|
| 2:21:45| especially with what Mr. Martin said in terms of the public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| that we would have to go through in order to have that actually happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8513)|
| 2:21:54| I agree with Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8514)|
| 2:21:55| I have no problem with going forward with this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8518)|

| 2:22:01| I feel very comfortable moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8523)|

| 2:22:10| We're back to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| I don't think we've done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8535)|

| 2:23:18| Just very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| We've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| You know, I know as we all campaign and what have you, we always say, you know, we support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8600)|
| 2:23:25| the city schools or the county schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8605)|
