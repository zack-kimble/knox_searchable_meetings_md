| 0:04:30| The Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| First, some of you probably saw this announcement, but I want to make sure everybody knows that Knoxville is now officially a playful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=273)|
| 0:04:42| Hoops will now be mandatory at all council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| So last week, KABOOM!, the non-profit organization that helps build playgrounds across the country, announced that Knoxville has been selected as a playful city USA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=285)|
| 0:04:55| This is an initiative to recognize communities that are offering innovative forms of play to youth, especially in urban settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| You probably remember that a few years ago, KABOOM! awarded Knoxville a grant to build a new playground at The Muse in Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=303)|
| 0:05:11| They're also closely involved in the Let's Move program, which you all know we're very involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| So this new playful city USA designation will give us access to more grants related to creative play opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| and it's another feather in our cap for all the work we and our partners in the community, including the health department who's out there tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| all that we're doing to make Knoxville a healthier, more active community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| Next item, this Thursday, May 26, there will be a public meeting at 530 p.m. at the East Tennessee Historical History Center to present our updated downtown parking strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=337)|
| 0:05:50| Deputy to the mayor, Bill Lyons, will be celebrating his birthday that day by giving a presentation along with our downtown coordinator, Rick Emmett, and other city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=350)|
| 0:06:02| That's what you do in a playful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| In a playful city, you spend your birthday talking about downtown parking changes, strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| So Rick Emmett and other city staff will join him to celebrate his birthday at that parking meeting and to answer any questions anybody might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| As council knows, we have recently purchased new parking meters, which will be installed throughout downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| And along with that installation, we have taken a comprehensive look at how we manage public parking, both on street and in our garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=384)|
| 0:06:32| As downtown has grown and evolved during the past decade, we have seen increased parking demand from residents, employees, and visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=392)|
| 0:06:40| So this meeting on Thursday is to talk about our strategy to balance all of those demands and make sure we are managing our resources effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=400)|
| 0:06:50| So join us for Bill Lyons' birthday party at 530 p.m. Thursday at the East Tennessee History Center, 601 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=410)|
| 0:06:58| Another meeting I want to make sure that's on everybody's calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| The annual business breakfast, which is organized by our purchasing department, will take place on Tuesday, June 14, from 730 to 1130 a.m. at the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=422)|
| 0:07:14| If you're a business owner interested in bidding a contract with the City of Knoxville, but don't know exactly how to get started, this is a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=434)|
| 0:07:24| You can learn about City projects and purchases that we expect to put out for bid or contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| Not everything is bid out, so there's other kinds of opportunities besides just the bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| But you'll hear what we plan to do over the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| We have about $55 million in annual spending, and we really want to encourage local companies and vendors to compete for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| We particularly encourage minority and women-owned businesses and veteran businesses to be there to learn about it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| Representatives from city departments will present information about specific projects, the anticipated date the work will be going out for bid, or that we will be seeking contracts, and bidder qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=473)|
| 0:08:06| Admission is free, and you can register online at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash business breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=486)|
| 0:08:14| Again, the breakfast is Tuesday mornings, June 14, from 730 to 1130 a.m. in the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=494)|
| 0:08:23| Finally, I want to remind everyone that this coming Monday is Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| City offices will be closed, but our contractor, Waste Connections, will run its regular residential garbage and recycling routes on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=508)|
| 0:08:39| So if you have a Monday pickup, make sure that you put your trash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| I hope everybody has a great weekend with your friends and your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=523)|

| 0:08:49| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| A couple of things I want to just reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Tonight we're voting on changing the time for city council meetings and also the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| If that passes tonight, that will be effective July 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| So we just want the public to know that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=545)|

| 0:09:32| And also tonight we'd like to take a few minutes to have Dr. Buchanan, who's with the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| She would like to give us a sort of an update on what the county is doing in regard to the Zika virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| So Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| Playful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| And I'm very happy that we're a playful city and really appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Thank you, council members, for this opportunity and appreciate the partnership with the city of Knoxville and all that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| And let's move programs and other things that we do to improve the health of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| I want to take this opportunity to update you on the Zika virus and what's being done locally and what we need to be concerned about or not be concerned about kind of a situational update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=606)|
| 0:10:19| Obviously, there's Zika virus in Central and South America and several countries and several thousand cases in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=619)|
| 0:10:27| There to date are about five hundred and forty four cases, all of whom are travel related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| So that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| There's no local transmission in the continental United States at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| That may happen over the summer, but it hasn't happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Of those cases, 10 were sexually transmitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| So there is sexual transmission and mosquito borne transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| But all people have traveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| So the sexual transmission, someone traveled, came back and and gave Zika to their partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| And that's occurred in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| There are two entities that are part of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| The Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands do have local transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| So if you were to travel to Puerto Rico or U.S. Virgin Islands, there's a potential for you to become infected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| So how would it happen that we would get Zika here or Zika locally transmitted in the United States or in Tennessee or in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| Someone would have to travel to one of those countries, get infected with Zika, come home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| get bitten by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is not in high population in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| probably higher population in Memphis and Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| And then that mosquito would have to go bite somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| So that's how we would get local transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| We are working with the department of, not department, sorry, the vet school to attempt to trap the Aedes aegypti mosquito.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=709)|
| 0:12:02| I won't go into all the details, but mosquitoes like certain things and not all mosquitoes like the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| Lots of different kinds of mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| So we have some traps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| We'll be trying to trap those mosquitoes and identify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| We have not identified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Knox County over several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| So if we have it, it's in limited quantities, but it is also a mosquito that's kind of hard to trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| We do have its relative, Aedes albopictus, which transmits lacrosse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| which is something we do actually have in our community every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| So getting rid of the Aedes mosquito will help that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| So the main focus of what we're recommending for citizens to do is to empty out small containers of water on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=759)|
| 0:12:47| This mosquito can breed and lay its eggs, not breed, but lay its eggs in a bottle cap of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| and those eggs can go to larval stage and produce new mosquitoes in a bottle cap of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| So what we're encouraging citizens to do is look around their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| empty out that little dish in the bottom of your planter, empty out your bird baths, get rid of old tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| clean up your property, and do that on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| Look in dog bowls, dump those out on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| Seven days is about the time it takes, so we want people to do that weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| If people have questions, we're happy to come out and look at your property and help you identify what the risks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| These are mosquitoes that kind of stay around your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| They're daytime biters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| And one of the good things about here is that we have screens and air conditioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| and so mosquitoes can't come into our homes as readily as they can in Central and South America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| So the risk of having local transmission is a little lower here than it is in those countries, but not out of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=828)|
| 0:13:57| And we won't know until we see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| The bad news is that Zika, only 80% of the people who get Zika don't have any symptoms, so they don't know they had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=840)|
| 0:14:09| So that's a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| But the real risk is for pregnant women and for their children to have microcephaly, which is not just a small head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=852)|
| 0:14:20| It is a small head, but that small head comes with neurologic consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| and developmental delays and seizures and continuous disability for that child and that family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| So it is really a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| So we really want people to really get serious about mosquito control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| using DEET and long sleeves and getting rid of those places where mosquitoes can breed on their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| And we're happy to consult and help folks with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| We've also posted signs at McGee-Tyson for folks who are traveling or coming home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| reminding them to think about Zika if they get sick when they get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| So testing is available, but it's only through the Department of Health or the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| So it's not fast and it's not for diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| It's really just for surveillance, for us to be able to see if we have local transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| So that's why it's important for us to see that, because if we have local transmission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| we really want to know that and we're really going to step up our efforts in what we do as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| We'll continue our regular mosquito surveillance, which is really focused on preventing West Nile disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=918)|
| 0:15:27| What we do for West Nile disease doesn't impact the Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| That really focuses on the Culex mosquito, which carries West Nile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| So that really won't help us with that process, and we don't really have a way to test mosquitoes for Zika.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=940)|
| 0:15:51| So that's kind of the situational update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| Ronnie Neese is here if you guys have specific questions about our mosquito control program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| What we do with our mosquito control program will be based on whether we get local transmission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| and we'll have to evaluate that based on risk is really what we'll do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| So questions, concerns, questions about mosquito control specifically from Ronnie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| Councilman Dallavope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| You said you wouldn't know that you've been bit by one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| There are no symptoms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Eighty percent of the people don't have symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| About 20 percent of the people have mild symptoms, fever, joint pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| They may get a rash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| They also get some conjunctivitis or infection in their eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| but that's only 20 percent of the people bitten get those symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| So how do you know what you just killed and whether you got it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| It's a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| You won't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| So travelers have to be especially careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Travelers have to be especially careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| That's the message also in addition to getting rid of those small breeding grounds on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| If you're planning to go to Central or South America, U.S. Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| you need to be aware and exercise mosquito prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| Pregnant women who are considering travel, if they can delay that travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| it's a recommendation that they delay that travel because the risk is so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| I want to ask you about travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| A lot of people travel to the Caribbean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| Is that a particular area where you need to be cautious of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| I'm trying to think of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| Some parts of the Caribbean do have local transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| I can't name all of them off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| When people are going to travel, what we advise them to do is go to the CDC website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| and look at the countries affected or the places affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| and also contact our travel clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| They're really staying up to date on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| And there are also vaccinations that you might need that you don't think you need when you're going to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Thanks, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| For several years, the Westview community has been working to deal with the six cemeteries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| that are neglected and in the community, and it's finally coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| So this Friday morning at 1030, the partners, Knox Heritage, the Westview Community Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| the Tennessee Design Center will all be involved in unveiling some signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| so that people know which cemetery is what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| And also there's been rumor for many years to be a slave cemetery in Westview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| and that has now been identified and will be discussed on Friday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| This is at 1030 at Crestview Cemetery off of Keith Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| Everyone's invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Anything else, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| 9A is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations for the several departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| agencies, and funds of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| and ending June 30, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| 9B is an ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable properties, real, personal, and mixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| within the corporate limits of the City of Knoxville to provide sufficient revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| to fund the General Fund and Debt Service Fund operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1181)|

| 0:19:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1192)|

| 0:19:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| 9C is an ordinance to amend Section 2-450, 2-458, and 2-459 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| to adjust the City of Knoxville's Classification and Compensation Plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| for general government, police, and fire employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Councilman Dela Vokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Yeah, I don't know if Vicki Hatfield's here or someone's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| Just curious, Vicki, in the Section 3, I guess it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| we have deleted whatever we had in the past and have a listing of 35 directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| but no salary ranges, caps, or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| What does that do to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| That's like, what, $3 million, $4 million, $5 million worth of salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| The only reason that one was specifically included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| is because we needed to remove public assembly's director from the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| Nothing else in the list has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| It appears exactly the way it appears in the code now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| We're now contracting that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| We took it off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| So that listing appears exactly the way it appears in the code now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| with the removal of that one job class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| And did you ever have ranges for that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| A long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Yeah, I think we have not had ranges as far back as I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| I know at least 2007 they may have been in a very large range prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| but it's always been fairly vaguely defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| I guess the way you deal with that then is at the appropriation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| If there's an issue, you would raise it there, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| For setting salaries for directors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| It's basically done when a position is filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| usually set by the mayor and Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| I wanted to ask you about the pay scale on our lower level employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| So what we're proposing now would be almost $11 per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| Is that about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| It would be about $10.75 per hour for our lowest pay grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| and close to $12 per hour for pay grade two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| And the salary survey is done how often do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Also, Mayor, I would like to address David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Do you want to add the information about when our public service workers come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| in a very short time they can actually move up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| David Brace, City Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| And Vicky could have talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| We work with civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| We found that many of our public service worker one employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| those entry level field employees, once they receive their CDL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| we work with Vicky to develop a program where they get their CDL| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| and a certain amount of time they automatically bump into a PS2 position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| a public service worker two position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| It would bump up to about 12-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| I'm looking at Vicky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| More than $12, right at $12 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| And so as long as they get their CDL, we actually help with that training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| We send them through training with our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| We've got a master equipment operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Those employees get their CDL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Explain what a CDL is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Commercial driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Get their commercial driver's license, which then allows them to operate our vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| and they'll bump automatically to that PS2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| So as long as they're willing to do that work and we provide the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| and pay for the CDL, they can automatically bump into that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1431)|

| 0:26:32| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| 10D is an ordinance approving the request of Fenton Nissan for a one-year planned amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| from low-density residential to general commercial for property located on the south side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| Clinton Highway, west of Tillery Road, on appeal from a decision of the Metropolitan Planning Commission, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1611)|
| 0:27:01| Okay, so this is an appeal, so as Council will recall, we start first with the appellant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| and they can have up to three speakers each for up to five minutes per speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| and then we'll go to the respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| So I see Mr. Seymour wants to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Mayor, members of Council, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Did we get rebuttal on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Yes, you get a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Mayor, members of Council, I'm here on behalf of Fenton Nissan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| one of the three new car dealerships left on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| Fenton started leasing the property, and I think most of you all are familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| have driven by it two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| They have bumped up their business there to the point where they're now selling 160 cars a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| They discovered after leasing the property, based on a complaint from a neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| that the back 25 percent of the property is zoned R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| C4 is the required zoning for a car dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| They are out of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| They need places to park more automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| They're selling them as fast as they can get them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| We filed a request to rezone that back park from R1 to C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| That was recommended by the MPC staff with a number of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| designed to protect residents and other people on Tillery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| MPC denied that, so I have appealed up here to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| Tonight, the issue before you is twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| If you deny our appeal, this is over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| If you grant our appeal, all you can do is refer this back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission with instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1734)|
| 0:29:02| I have communicated to you all that if Fenton cannot use most of that property out there for their car dealership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1742)|
| 0:29:14| they will be unable to remain in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Nissan basically wants them to move to Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| The 160 cars a month results in a huge sales tax benefit to the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1763)|
| 0:29:31| and if they left the county, I think it would be harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| What I'm asking you here tonight is to remand this matter back to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1776)|
| 0:29:45| for consideration of a solution that enables Fenton Nissan to stay at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| or and protect surrounding property owners and neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| Fenton does not want to antagonize anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Everybody is a potential customer for their business, especially people who live very close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| and I am sure that people of goodwill who are willing to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| can find a solution that would allow them to remain in that location and continue in business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1814)|
| 0:30:23| without damaging or hindering or impeding the peace and tranquility that people have on Tillery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1823)|
| 0:30:34| And that is my simple request to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| I sent a memorandum to everybody on city council that identified what I thought the issues were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1838)|
| 0:30:47| but that's my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Now, Mr. Phil Miner is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| He's the general manager of Fenton Nissan, an experienced professional in the automobile industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| He has taken their business over the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| They've got goals from Nissan, which you're ahead of, aren't you, Phil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| which involves selling more cars, collecting more taxes for the city, the county, and the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1870)|
| 0:31:18| and being a good neighbor to everybody on Clinton Highway, Tillery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| and anybody that happens to live around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| So that's my simple request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Mr. Miner was able to talk to several of you before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| but rather than rely on data that I have given you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| I'm going to ask him to give you a little data and confirm the issues as he sees them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| Please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| and you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I'm Philip Miner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| My business address is 4515 Clinton Highway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| So thank you all for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| My name is Phil Miner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| I'm the general manager, executive manager of Fenton Nissan in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| In 2014, we leased our location at 4515 Clinton Highway to take over a dealership from 640 Nissan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1938)|
| 0:32:29| We were the fourth owner of a Nissan dealership in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| Three others had failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Three others were basically bailed out by Nissan and provided with new ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1960)|
| 0:32:49| During the time of those three prior owners, a lot changed at Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| A lot of businesses went under, including car dealerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| It left a lot of empty, open, run-down storefronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| A lot of those still exist today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| When we came to the business, we knew that we had two parcels of land that we paid a commercial tax on both parcels of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=1993)|
| 0:33:23| Shame on us, but our realization that one of those commercial taxes was we paid a commercial tax just because we were a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| even though the property was zoned residential in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| A complaint was filed because we had vehicles parked on that back part of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| They asked us to move the vehicles out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| Then at that point, they recommended we seek counsel to try to address the situation, which is how I contacted Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2026)|
| 0:33:56| We have seen the MPC recommendation, which will allow cars to be parked at the rear parcels subject to a number of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| We're more than happy with those and more than willing to do above and beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| We don't want to make noise or lights or any of that kind of stuff back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| We just need overflow parking for vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| Our request is simply to be able to park certain cars at certain times of the year on our property so that we can remain in business in Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2060)|
| 0:34:29| At the present time, we're selling 160 vehicles new and used per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| This is generating $325,600 in sales tax monthly on vehicle sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| as well as another $18,200 in taxes from service and parts sales, excluding wholesales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2082)|
| 0:34:53| If we're forced to relocate because we cannot use the rear portion of our parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| unfortunately, Nissan recommends we move to Clinton, and that's where they've bought property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| If we have to move, now we'll have to seek Nissan's assistance for financial—to help with the property, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2105)|
| 0:35:14| Currently where we're at, we don't depend on Nissan to help make any of our day-to-day decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2114)|
| 0:35:22| We have no intent of encroaching on Tillery Road with the conditions imposed by MPC in our plans for utilization of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| Residents of Tillery Road or people on Tillery Road simply driving down Tillery Road would see absolutely no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| There would be no difference from what they see today to what they would see if we were able to park vehicles on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2137)|
| 0:35:47| The only difference that I can imagine is if we do move, there's yet another vacant, empty, run-down lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| that's not required by any manufacturer to be upkept, a new storefront put on every five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| all the things that we do as a requirement of our franchise that a lot of the other spots on Clinton Highway don't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2160)|
| 0:36:09| because there's nothing hardly there anymore but used car parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| But thank you for your time. That's all I can add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Now we'll hear from the—that was your only two, right? You only have two, Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Now for the respondents, we have Clark Hamilton, Lynn Redmond, and Anna Hodges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| You're going first, Mr. Redmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Mayor Rojero, members of City Council, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| I'm Lynn Redmond, 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| A quick little bit of rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Fenton Nissan, of course, is part of a large multi-state corporation out of Lafayette, Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2208)|
| 0:36:56| They own well over a dozen car dealerships in four states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| Mr. Seymour was telling me a cautionary tale that no one noticed when they purchased this property what the zoning was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2222)|
| 0:37:10| I think they would probably have legal recourse to whatever legal counsel they had for missing something so obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| But we're not here to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| We're here to talk about one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| We're not mad at Fenton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| We hope they do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| We'll work with them in any way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| What we can't do is break the R1 zoning barrier that has protected the residential communities, and that's plural, behind the C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2247)|
| 0:37:39| C4 is a rough, tough zone to live next to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| I speak from experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| I grew up on Clinton Highway and a block off of Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| It's incredibly tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| There's no good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| This barrier, which forms over 11 different pieces of property with Fenton-Nissan sort of on the edge of the middle of it, has worked for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2274)|
| 0:38:06| In fact, tonight we have Clark Hamilton here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| He was part of the original group that negotiated this back in the late 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| Ken Pruitt of MPC worked out the final deal and suggested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| It must have been a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| No one liked the deal at the time, but it has worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Is it inconvenient for Fenton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| But I think Fenton just mentioned their own solution, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| There are lots of half-empty car lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Some I've been talking to, they'd be more than happy to lease space to Fenton for overflow parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| It's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| The problem is collateral damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| The other thing is I want to emphasize this is not a game with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| This is not where we keep score against Arthur or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| This is our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| This is our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| This is a fatal blow to that end of Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| We asked you to turn down the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Mr. Hamilton or Anna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Anna Hodges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Who wants to go next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Anna Hodges, 1325 Lucy Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| I come to you as a resident of the new Norwood community, specifically Lucy Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| The street that I live on runs perpendicular to the land in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| But I am not here to ask you to uphold the MPC decision because of how exposed it would leave my home to Fenton-Nissan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| I'm here for a reason that I think is more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| When people ask me what part of town I live on, I say North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| And most people say, oh, I love that part of town with its cute little old historic houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| And you must eat at Central Flats and Taps all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| And I say, no, not old North Knoxville, North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| And they say, oh, there's some really nice places out off Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| And I say, no, not Powell, North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| Clinton Highway, pawn shops, cash advance and title loan businesses, muffler shops, car dealerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2409)|
| 0:40:20| I'm not here simply because I don't want a car dealership for a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| I'm here because I look around at what all Knoxville has going on for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| The gentrification of the Forth and Gill and Island Home neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| the expansion of the Cumberland Avenue strip, and the new Magnolia Avenue corridor project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| And the ongoing revitalization of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| The city has made huge investments in its neighborhoods and works to make this an appealing place to live and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| Yesterday I had the pleasure of hearing Louisville, Kentucky Mayor Greg Fischer speak about how he has led his city to prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2447)|
| 0:40:55| It was refreshing to hear a government official talk about the importance of compassion in business and in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| I hope that you will recognize the importance of compassion in this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| Clinton Highway is not one of Knoxville's bright spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| It will be someday, I'm sure of it, but it's not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| I'm not asking for money or resources to be devoted to my part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| The city is doing enough right now as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| I'm just asking that this out-of-state corporation, this business that lacks compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| be blocked from driving North Knoxville, my North Knoxville, further behind the rest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| Thank you, Ms. Hodges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| And now Mr. Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2500)|
| 0:41:52| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| I'm Clark Hamilton, 1200 State One Drive, board member of the Norwood Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| Ken Pruitt and I, this issue come up when the Claytons tried to rezone it back to Tillery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2520)|
| 0:42:09| And working with Ken to try to protect that portion of our residential community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| we thought if we had a 200-foot buffer zone residential along Tillery Road, it would protect our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2536)|
| 0:42:24| It has worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| We ask you to maintain that 200-foot limit on the low residential, not to rezone this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| Okay, now the appellants can have up to a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| Mr. Redman says he wants Fenton Nissan to do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| I think we do also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| We hope they do well in Knoxville, in the city of Knoxville, rather than the city of Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2573)|
| 0:43:01| What I'm asking simply is that you all refer this back to MPC with the request that this issue be studied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2581)|
| 0:43:10| and see if there is not a solution that people of good will can agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| that would protect Ms. Hodge's home and the other homes around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| and protect Fenton Nissan's business to continue to do well in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| They are a foreign corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Most of our big businesses are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| That's no reason not to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I think if people will keep open minds and open ears, there's probably a way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Before Arthur sits down, Arthur, has there been any meetings that you had with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| to discuss these solutions that you think might be out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| I wrote Mr. Redman when the zoning petition was filed, an invited discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| The next thing I heard, and I mentioned it to him several times at meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| the next thing I heard from him was a letter to MPC opposing it before the MPC hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| He never called me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Aside from yourself, did your client meet with him at any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Clients open for business six days a week, and we invited discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| and we have not heard any reciprocal interest in discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| We're happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| I wonder if I can ask MPC, while I'm asking questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| what would be the process if we sent this back to you to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| What would you do that you haven't already done, I guess, is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| Dan Kelly, MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| What Mr. Seymour is referring to is a state law which requires that plan amendments be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| the plans are a function of the planning commission, and particularly the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| and if they're denied by the planning commission, once they get to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| they have to be referred back under the name of the city council as requesting your own plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2719)|
| 0:45:27| So we would, in essence, be rehearing the same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| We have taken the stance in the past that that was true for sector plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| but not necessarily for one-year plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| and the appeals of one-year plan amendments have come forward and have been heard with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| I don't know if Mr. Swanson has an opinion in that regard, or if you want to, by virtue of just being cautious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2749)|
| 0:45:58| want to refer it back to MPC and initiate your own plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| I guess my question was more substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| What would you do to solve the impasse we have right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| I mean, the neighborhood says preserve the buffer, it keeps our residential area good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| and Nissan says without more parking on that side or possibly other sites, they don't say that second bar, we can't stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2774)|
| 0:46:23| I mean, what function does MPC do if it's referred back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| I presume we could try to facilitate some interaction between the two parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| I don't know at this point whether or not there is a middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| There may be possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| I know that Mr. Seymour has talked about split zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| The staff had talked about buffers, limiting access on Tilbury Road, lighting, sound, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2802)|
| 0:46:53| To our point of view, the split zoning is not necessarily a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| The neighborhood has already said that the issues with regard to buffers and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| they're not receptive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| They feel that holding the line is what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| The Planning Commission accepted or adopted the position of the neighborhood and voted against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| And any time you draw a line, in zoning, any time you draw that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| there's going to be somebody that's going to be happy on one side of the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| and somebody that's going to be unhappy on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| And the Planning Commission recommended to you that it just stay the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| I went out and looked at the property on Saturday and talked to representatives of Clayton on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2862)|
| 0:47:50| the north and the south of Fenton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| And if you look at the map, this is 451 in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| or the other map showing it that were given to us, there's CNN owned by Clayton as well on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| The back portion is completely unused, as is a portion between the two buildings to the north that Clayton Used Cars has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2884)|
| 0:48:12| You know, I've asked them, have you all had any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| Have you offered to potentially lease a portion for auxiliary parking for Fenton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| And they said they have not talked to them at all, but they would be receptive to that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| So, you know, I would like to think that that would be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| I don't know if Fenton is booming so well and doing so much business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| maybe they could afford a little bit of payment each month to store some extra cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| That's certainly not our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| But, you know, I feel like this zoning has been in place for, what, approximately 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| It's a good buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Nobody wants to see jobs and tax sales leave Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| I don't, I mean, it's the will of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| If they want to try to let MPC look at this again, I just don't see an option or a compromise on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| It seems like it's all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| And I motion we deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| You made a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Is that what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| So we have a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Okay, now discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| I'll just go back to Dan Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| Dan, does MPC take a parcel and split the zoning on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| Do you all do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Do you recommend that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Is that a viable option, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| And how would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| There are parcels in the city and county that are split zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| But in this particular case, split zoning a piece of property like this would, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| render a portion of it totally unusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| And we feel that that's an inappropriate use of zoning is to render a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| or a portion of the property unusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| So therefore, we would not encourage you to go in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| There's nothing that would prevent it from coming back and being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| The rest of it would be rezoned in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| They could come back the following month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| There's nothing in our current zoning code that allows for a variance or an exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| or anything else that we can know that would permanently prohibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| We don't have that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| We don't have those options available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| It's only C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| I mean, C-4 doesn't seem appropriate on Tillery Road, but there's nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| There's nothing you can't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| There's no other C-zone that allows storage of outside cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| even though you're not selling off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| C-6 would allow it, but you're in the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| The building setback is greater in C-6 than it is in C-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| but they're not proposing to build any buildings back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| The proposal, the required landscape buffer that's in the C-6 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| is what we recommended, what the staff recommended in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| So from that standpoint, there isn't any leeway as far as the car sales element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| This is before you because what they're proposing to do is store vehicles back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| but by virtue of the fact, you know, if you call it parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| there's probably other alternatives, but they're storing vehicles for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| and I guarantee you if you want a red one and they've got a red one back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| they'll take you back and show you that car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| So from that standpoint, it really isn't any different and needs the C-4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| That's been the interpretation of the chief building official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| in order to be able to use that portion of the property for a vehicle store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| So could park employee cars on another zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| Can't park employee cars on O-1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| They'd have to go through the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| for parking in a more restrictive zone, but you could do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| Because that could potentially be an option if we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| I don't know whether sending it back to NPC is an option or postponing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| but I mean that's potentially an option that we could find a zone that you could park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| you probably don't have 110 employees, as he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| or 100, I don't know, I mean, 65?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| So there you go, that's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| So I mean it's possible that there are other zones that could be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| that might fit Tillery Road that you could park employee cars on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| that are not necessarily cars to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| I mean is that to find a line or is that something worth looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| I feel like I'm in a position here to represent the Planning Commission's action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| and they have basically said they feel that the property should remain R-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| Now the O-1 option could be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| I think that would be a change from what has been in place, the R-1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3176)|
| 0:53:05| and if the idea is that any change would break the current zoning barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3185)|
| 0:53:14| if you want to call it that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| there are other properties up Tillery Road that are also zoned R-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| that back up or are the back part of these car dealerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| so you could potentially anticipate seeing that type of activity in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| But the one-year plan calls for what, for that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| The one-year plan calls for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| The second plan is the one that has the general commercial designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| and that's why the staff recommended the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| because typically these plans build on one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| and the sector plan and preparing the one-year plan is kind of the basis for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3227)|
| 0:53:54| So that's why the staff recommended approval, one-year plan change in the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3234)|
| 0:54:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| You know, that's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| I mean it's serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| It's over $3 million worth of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| and you can watch a Bible business go out without consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| but that's really all I have to say now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| If this would be sent back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| what kind of timeline are we looking at before we come back to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3264)|
| 0:54:34| This is May, end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| I don't know that we could get it on the June agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| It would probably appear on the July agenda at the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| and would come back to you presumably around the first meeting in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| As Councilman Wallace said, we're in a real dilemma at this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| We have talked recently about the loss of tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| with the legislative action in regard to the hall tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| We have a viable business that is operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| employing 65 people and contributing quite a bit of revenue to the city in the form of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3314)|
| 0:55:23| When I drove up to look at the property this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| I expected one thing and I saw something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| What I expected to see was probably cars would be parked right up almost on to Tillery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| What I saw was a lot of empty space, a natural hedge or vegetation of about 12 to 15 feet across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3337)|
| 0:55:46| where there was a housing complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| There was a hedge there of vegetation, trees, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| I didn't feel like the people who lived in those houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| were going to be looking in the back window of cars that might be parked there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| Mr. Kelly said that if I wanted a red car and it was at the back of a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| that I would traipse to the back of a lot to find the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| I recently purchased a new car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| It happened to be a Nissan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| It was not from Fenton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| And it is red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| They did find the car and bring it to me rather than have me traipsing to the back of the car a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3381)|
| 0:56:28| Most of the dealers seem to do that now because I looked at a lot of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| I have a very difficult time not supporting the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| I understand that this zoning has been in place for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| I think what gives me as much heartburn as some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| is the fact that we have a sector plan and a one-year plan that are not in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| and they've been allowed to get to this point, and I just find that inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| We depend on the agreement of the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| and now we're in a situation where they are not in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| and we're having to make decisions that we should not be having to make because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3429)|
| 0:57:17| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| I, too, drove out there to take a look at the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| and the real concern I have is what I refer to as commercial creep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| Tillery Road right now when you drive down is a very pleasant kind of residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| Even though there's trees planted on the particular lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| there's nothing that says that those trees are going to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| The other concern I have is that as you go on up the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| there are four additional residents on that side which back up to the commercial car lots there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| but then there's also a very large piece of land as you go further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| and I think that it's important that we have buffers between zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| and we've got a natural buffer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| We have a buffer that's been in effect for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| and I really think that it needs to stay that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| that there are just as Mark was talking about, there's properties on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| and whether or not, Mark, there's a possibility that those folks can get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| in terms of talking about leasing additional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| To me, that's more important than disrupting a natural buffer that we have between a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| I do feel very strongly that I would hate to see a business go out because of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| but I also kind of consider that as a threat also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| So I really feel that that buffer should stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Okay, so now no more lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| So the motion before us is a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| Are you ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| The appeal to send it back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| No, it's a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| So if we're in agreement, we say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| Yes, if you're in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| So it wouldn't be sending back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| It would deny the appeal of the Nissan dealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| Everybody understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| That's the motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Councilman Kampen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Councilman De La Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Vice Mayor Greve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160524?start=3582)|
