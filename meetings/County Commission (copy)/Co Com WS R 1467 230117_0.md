| 0:01:19| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=79)|
| 0:01:26| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=86)|
| 0:01:41| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| At this time, we will set our agenda for the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| There are zero additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| There are two deferrals, numbers 47 and 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| Withdrawals, item number 5, 15, 19, 67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=118)|
| 0:02:08| Director Moyers, we're going to add a withdrawal to that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| It is item number 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| Item 68 is an appeal from a decision by the TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| I say decision in quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| The TTCDA took no action on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Under Ordinance 1434, the TTCDA is required to either approve or deny, within 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=147)|
| 0:02:35| of the application being filed, if they take no action, the Certificate of Appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| is considered to be approved under 1434B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| Therefore, because there was no motion or second made under the, like they say in sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| by rule, the COA is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| So that appeal is not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| And the applicant will be here on a rezoning, but I don't think it's necessary for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| to take up the appeal at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| And by the way, I've also run this by Tasha Blankney, the attorney for the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| She agrees with my reading of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| So withdrawals again are items number 5, 15, 19, 67, and now 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| Non-consent items, items 1 through 3, 7 through 9, 16, 32, 35, 48, 49, 51, and our zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=205)|
| 0:03:44| which are items 54 through 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| And I'll repeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Non-consent items include items numbers 1 through 3, 7 through 9, 16, 32, 35, 48, 49,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=230)|
| 0:04:04| 51, and 54 through 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| Commissioner Schoenmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=254)|

| 0:04:19| that we discussed the time and day of zoning meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=259)|
| 0:04:28| And that would be for tonight only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| We'll add that discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=274)|

| 0:08:32| Mr. Lee has a little bit of misinformation as far as the public trust we have in our law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=512)|
| 0:08:40| Now, I'm backing up as far as 2005, ADA Murray Ward accused me of rape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| Now, Attorney General Randy Nichols put the Knoxville Police Department and the TBI on my back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| and we went as far as the rape kit being done and no DNA belonging to me on Ms. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| But Randy Nichols, Charmaine Allen, Jason Honeycutt, Willie Lane, Hector Sanchez, who's now a judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=542)|

| 0:09:25| I'm sorry, the judges, Judge Sword, Judge Green, Judge McGee, who's now retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| Judge Stansbury, they have seen the conduct of law enforcement officers ignoring their oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=571)|
| 0:09:44| Like I said before, Randy Nichols put me on the hot seat in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=584)|
| 0:09:54| Officers I've identified as threatening my life, officers Baldwin, Lane, Stansbury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=594)|

| 0:10:06| Officer Turner, he had another case in 2015 where he put a canine on a young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| had him mauled in the middle of the street and left him laying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=612)|

| 0:10:51| Assaulting this woman in the middle of the night, having her stripped almost naked in the middle of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| Officer lied about it. Did Judge Stansbury put that cop on the hot seat? No, he did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=657)|
| 0:11:06| We have a police officer here who run over a young man in the middle of the night, 100 miles an hour, Kingston Pike, no charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| Charmaine Allen is not doing her job holding these law enforcement officers responsible for their irresponsible actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Now, November 9th, I was in Judge Allen's courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| Attorney Kiser wanted to put me responsible for $11,574 attorney fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=688)|
| 0:11:39| No. He tried it again this past Friday, January 13th, 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=699)|
| 0:11:49| $15,000, 189. Total $26,763 for fighting for my life for a false accusation of rape that I've been beating the pavement with ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=709)|
| 0:12:06| So here we are today, 2023. But guess what? We're over here in federal court with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| We've been over there in federal court since June. Everybody's sitting around waiting to see what happens next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| I'm still here. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| Next on our list is Will Bowen. If you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| Following Will is Rick Roach and then Ginger Treese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=749)|
| 0:12:36| Thank you, Madam Chair. Will Bowen, 5669 Eagle Crest Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| Commissioners, I'm going to have to split this up because I've got three things I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| So the honorary resolution for the Right to Life Month is just, I mean, there are better things that you all can do with your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=769)|
| 0:12:57| than to recognize something that has already been made completely illegal by the state of Tennessee in any circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| Let me just hearken back to 2014 Amendment 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=783)|
| 0:13:11| Knox County voters said no to Amendment 1 by a three-point margin in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=791)|
| 0:13:20| which put that there is no right to an abortion in the state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| So you're already going against Knox County voters from 2014, which is now nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| So let me ask a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| Do you think that public sentiment has switched more pro-choice or pro-life in the last nine years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| not to mention the last calendar year alone? I'll answer that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| There are more pro-choice people in Knox County today than there were in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| So just the idea that something that pointless was passed is kind of, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| or passed or going to pass next week, but it's just not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=838)|
| 0:14:06| So let me move on to my next item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| On a lighter note, the western Knoxville bypass proposed by Commissioner Jay is a fantastic idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| and should be pursued because there's way too much traffic on I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| And I think all of us know this if we're trying to drive out to Farragut or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| I mean, it takes, what, 20, 25, 30 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| Any feasible option that can be researched to solve that problem would be preferable to what we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| or just adding more main lanes onto the freeway with space that we do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| because we've built up so close to the freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| So the thing about the western Knoxville bypass is that, you know, environmental concerns are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| and we want to make sure that we deal with that as best as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| and also the citizens of, let's see, it would be what, Anderson, Rhone, and Loudon counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| Make sure that, because if I'm remembering correctly, they already voted down a similar proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| But, I don't know, of course it's worth trying again because we've got a problem and we need to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| But I would rather it not be told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| I know that that's the direction that the state seems to be going in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| but like I said, any feasible option that can fix our congestion issue on our stretch of highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| should be properly pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| And then the third and final thing, I'll leave you with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| So the McAllister's incident, I spoke about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| I guess it was, what, December 22nd or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| It was not resolved and the Knox County Sheriff's Office has still not been held accountable for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=959)|
| 0:16:06| And like my friend just said, the Knox County Sheriff's Office has never been held accountable for their actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=966)|
| 0:16:14| any time ever in recent memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| So I will leave you with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| Rick Roach, please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| State your name and county of residence for the record, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| Rick Roach, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| I'm just going to ask you what the two previous speakers have touched on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| Spangler needs to be held accountable for that matter, so does our district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| I've watched too many times where they have come out and done their, quote, legal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| They're taking so-called responsibility, and in the process, particular communities have been underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| I want to speak more specifically to what happened with Shanika Dawn Robinson's daughter, Anaya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1031)|
| 0:17:28| I've had confrontation and interaction with the Sheriff's Department, especially over the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| I started associating with them more when I was associated with a group called Justice Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| Some of you may be familiar with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| I was one of the people who would do follow-ups as far as commitments were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| At that time, J.J. Jones was the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| I was the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| I was in charge of the district attorney's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| No CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| I mean, we got played with on that, because if there was CIT, if there was any type of training that would help deputies or any other law enforcement focus on what needed to be done in a crisis situation, you wouldn't have had all these sensitive feelings being hurt of our Knox County deputies that were involved in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1093)|
| 0:18:28| Think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| Social media took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Kimberly Glenn needs to go, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| She just needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| I don't care if she's fired, resigns, somebody gives her the boot, literally, but she needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| She's protected ill-acting, bad-acting Knox County sheriff deputies since she's been in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| And y'all know some of these situations that have happened, from the old city situation, which was reprehensible, because the half of it wasn't even told on that, to this last situation that happened in the Galvesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1141)|
| 0:19:17| And you all have to find a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| Take as much money away from the sheriff's department as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| Until they get the message, you have to be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| You have to be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| We can't let this go on, because some really bad stuff is going to continue to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| I spent an hour one day with a person who had a complaint that happened that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| He was on duty at an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| They were treated poorly and actually targeted by the deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| We verified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| And the next thing you know, we spent an hour talking with Sergeant Champion in the professional standards office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| And this was the second incident involving this particular person, where we spent a whole day, literally a whole day, five or six of us, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| trying to get some answers to the bad behavior and get some accountability and responsibility taken by the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1213)|
| 0:20:22| Then Captain Norris, I believe he's a chief deputy now, just blew smoke up our you-know-what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1222)|

| 0:31:30| We want to give them the assistance to ensure that they can do their jobs effectively and appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| Thank you, sir. Commissioners, does anybody have any questions or discussion for Mr. Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1895)|
| 0:31:44| Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. County Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to approve. All those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| Any opposed? That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| Item number 32 is Resolution R-23-1-110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| It's appointing Darlene Moyers, Chris Battle, and a commissioner to the Agricultural Extension Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| Term expires December 31, 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| Commissioners, Commissioner Daley is term limited on this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| so therefore there is an open seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| I will now open the floor for nominations or ask if there's any commissioner that is willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1949)|
| 0:32:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| Point of clarification, if Commissioner Daley would like to continue on, does he have that option if no one else wants to serve on that board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Tennessee Code Annotated 495104 deals with County Agricultural Extension Committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| It states that members are elected for two-year terms, and it states that no member may be elected for more than three consecutive terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1977)|
| 0:33:05| So if Commissioner Daley's been on for three consecutive terms, then he would not, under the statute, be qualified to serve for a fourth term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1991)|
| 0:33:19| That's sad, so I nominate Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| So you've served the six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| You're going to move these nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| Move to cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2025)|
| 0:33:54| Yes, I'd like to amend that we approve by acclamation the appointment of Kim Frazier for the Agriculture Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| Commissioner Frazier, if so elected, will you serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| I've got big shoes to fill with Commissioner Daley, but I would be honored to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| Commissioner Daley, don't go too far, because I'll need you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| So the resolution now reads as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2077)|
| 0:34:53| appointing Darlene Moyers, Chris Battle, and Commissioner Kim Frazier to the Agricultural Extension Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| Term expires December 31, 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| Motion to approve by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| Any discussion? Seeing none, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| Any opposed? That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| Item number 35, Resolution R-23-1-301, is approving a vehicle trade between the Knox County Sheriff's Office and the Knox County Rescue Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'll be recusing myself to avoid any perceived conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| Motion to approve by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| Commissioners, I pulled this simply for the fact that Commissioner Frazier had requested to recuse herself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| and she didn't want that to be the entire consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| So that is the only reason. Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| All those in favor say aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2176)|
| 0:36:26| The next item is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| Resolution R-23-1-902,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| and I'll be reading the revised caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| It's a resolution encouraging the Tennessee Department of Transportation, TDOT, and state legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| to examine the potential for a new highway bypass around Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| Commissioner Jay? Motion to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| Motion to approve by Commissioner Jay with a second by Commissioner Ward. Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you, Madam Chair. Commissioners, I wrote this resolution after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| lots of discussion and some preliminary work with our state senator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Ms. Becky Massey, who heads up the Transportation Committee on a statewide level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| And I know that I can't imagine there's a commissioner here that hasn't had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| constituent have this conversation in some way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| It comes down to this. We're a growing, thriving community, but we're also the regional hub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| for all of East Tennessee. And we're growing at a pace where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| our current infrastructure on all levels is not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| sustainable now and certainly won't be in the future in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| And while this is not a new, unique idea, it's something that we've missed opportunities with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| There's been lots of discussion for lots of years, and it all has to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| with an idea. It has to start with a bit of a spark from us as a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| And the resolution before you is simply asking our state representatives and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| Tennessee Department of Transportation to begin examining it, put it back in the hopper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| to some extent, and think about what it might look like. A third of the country's population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| lives right within 500 miles of Knoxville, and we are the crossroads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| of the entire eastern seaboard. The north-south corridor starts in Canada,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| goes to Key West, and comes right through here. The east-west corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| starts here and goes all the way to California, and everything has to funnel into a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| small urban core. And so, as you can see in the resolution, there's lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| of data. The one that stood out to me the most when researching this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| in the state, we have three of the five most congested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| spots in all of Tennessee, and the number one is our corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| that runs 18 miles through the heart of our community. I don't know where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| would go, I don't know what it would cost, I don't know how long it would take. These are all the questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| would need to be examined on a much bigger scale, but I'm asking for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| support to be part of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| If everybody would love to co-sponsor, that would even be better, but I'd love to see us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| support this. We have a meeting with our state delegation this week. We have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| to put this at the top of the list, and maybe one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| we'll find some relief. I think doing nothing is not an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| and ultimately, I hope that this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| will continue to think, what does this community look like 30 to 50 years from now? What can we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| to make those decisions right now, and how can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| at least push the ball forward, working with everybody in our Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| legislative, executive, and departments to ask for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| ideas to spark, and some ideas and solutions to come forward. Open up the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| to questions and comments, and I appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| You mind if I make a suggestion, please? Thank you for recognizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| me, Chairperson. Madam Chairwoman, actually, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| In March, the Transportation Planning Organization passed a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| requesting that TDOT convene a study to look at congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| on I-40 and come up with solutions, which might be a bypass, which might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| be something else and something additional. So maybe with this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| you would look at not just a bypass, but other solutions as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| which would make it more harmonious with what we did with the TPO. So just a suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| but I'd like to know, and we can send you what we said to the state, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| Okay, thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to be added on to that, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| for the new commissioners, that when we do something like this, a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| the more votes we got, the better it is. And a unanimous vote is even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| Because that's what they look at down at, they want support before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| they stick their necks out on the line, they want our support. So, yes, please add me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| Thank you, Madam Chair. And Commissioner Jay, I'd like to also be added, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Same, add me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| Is it going to be full commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| Any more discussion regarding this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to approve. All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2523)|

| 0:43:03| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Cohen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| Mike Cohen, 5523 Parkdale Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| We had our agenda review last Friday and you were there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| And this is Dana Dawson, the Commodore of the club, in case you've never met a Commodore before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| You know, we discussed, it's not going to be $1,000, it's going to be $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| It's a five-year term at $5,000 per year, and then there are some other things that we will work out with the county about access and some other things to increase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2618)|
| 0:43:46| Yeah, that's going to be the access, and then this is only going to be a five-year term, not a renewable after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2626)|
| 0:43:54| It's a five-year term, as we discussed in our agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| I just wanted to make sure that public access, five-year lease, and it is $5,000, not $1,000 on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2644)|
| 0:44:13| We're already working with Dwight and the county on that, and I think this is more a question of timing than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| There are things like liability and the ADA, there are issues we have to work out, but we're actively working on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| I understand. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| Just, Commissioner, to make sure we vote appropriately legislatively on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2671)|
| 0:44:40| then somebody would need to enter a substitute motion to amend the rate and amend the term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| and also I think you wanted to remove, I believe it's section 19, that includes the extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| so I can forward that to the chair if that's the will of the body, but just to make sure that the legislative item reflects the legislative intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2701)|
| 0:45:16| We're just clarifying that we would do any substitute motions next week because the motion on the floor is move forward with no recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| Is that accurate? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| I just wanted to echo that. I had a question, and this came up on another item we had on a previous agenda about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| when there is something like this, can we not move forward with a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2734)|
| 0:45:46| Currently, we wouldn't want to tonight because it's not stated correctly in what is on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| and so we need to ensure that we know exactly how that needs to be changed before we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| So no substitute motion is needed either at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| At this time, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| Thank you, Madam Chair. I guess I'll start with Dwight, several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| I think that you would agree that there's been significant change in Knox County in the past 25 years since the original lease was established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2773)|
| 0:46:27| and that the Concord Yacht Club has fulfilled their obligations for that 25-year lease, and they never missed their payment. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2792)|
| 0:46:41| But also in that 25 years, our recreational needs of the citizens of Knox County have also changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2801)|
| 0:46:51| We've got more people using the lakes now than we did 25 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| We've got more people using the boat launches that are to the east of the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| We've got more people using the Concord Yacht Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| We have the Cove Park, which is to the west of the Concord Yacht Club that's now being utilized by numerous, numerous people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| In fact, it's the most attended park in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| We've now attracted fishing-related events like Bassmasters to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| So my point has been that 230 club members have had exclusive access to this acreage that's owned by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2846)|
| 0:47:43| but now the 475,000 citizens in Knox County have not had access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| And what my concern was that maybe we need to relook at this property to only give the Yacht Club and their 230 members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2869)|
| 0:48:04| which don't all reside in Knox County, maybe half of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| and then designate half of the property to the citizens of Knox County where they can use it for a boat launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| As well as extended use from the park standpoint with picnic tables and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2898)|
| 0:48:29| I think it's highly unusual in all my years on commission that we've had a leasee make the contract and submit it to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2909)|
| 0:48:42| It should be that Knox County says this is the contract and here are the stipulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| I just want to make sure my colleagues realize that the Yacht Club gave us this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| This did not originate from Knox County. That's why the verbiage is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2935)|
| 0:49:03| And again, like Commissioner Daley said, we need to increase the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| So I don't think it's going to take five years to figure out what we need to do with this Knox County asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2950)|
| 0:49:19| They've had exclusive use and their 230 memberships for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2959)|
| 0:49:26| Maybe we need to look at revising this contract to just a three-year time period while it's still under the mayor's administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2966)|
| 0:49:36| as opposed to deferring something when the mayor's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| I'm sure the mayor's spent significant time trying to find a great parks director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| That is very dedicated to our parks in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| I would just like to see us re-look at using a part of this asset that Knox County has for the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=2991)|
| 0:50:04| not for the exclusive rights of a private club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| Let us come back to commission this week, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| We have a number of potential amendments to the agreement that we think would reflect some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| A couple considerations. Anytime we make a change like this, we have to look at it in the context of what precedent are we setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| So as we consider how we might amend this lease and open up this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| does this have implications for Concord Marina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| That's another leasehold arrangement that we have, and that's property that was conveyed to Knox County by TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| under similar terms and conditions as this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| So we want to make sure that we aren't setting a precedent that either has substantive implications for one of our other arrangements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| or that we can't live with down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| I don't think the club is at all averse to seeing the relationship evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| and certainly Parks and Recreation and the mayor's office is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| They're going to be paying us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| It's a leasehold arrangement, a modest amount to be sure, but it is a leasehold arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| So as we change the terms and conditions of that lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| I think that it is only fair and responsible to engage both risk management in that discussion and their insurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| Their insurer has written them a policy based on terms and conditions that previously existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| If we're going to change those, they need to be a party to that discussion at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| Ultimately, what I just would remind commission is the deliverable of the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| is the opportunity for somebody who wants to learn to sail or participate in the sailing sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| to have access to a location, have access to training and expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| have access to boats, have access and opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| as Commissioner Hill has referenced or some of the other programs through UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| their ultimate deliverable to us has been opportunity to engage in the sailing sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| It's no different from in the past when we've operated a rugby facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| We currently have a cricket pitch facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| We have disc golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| In this case, it's sailing, and with all that that involves, boats and equipment and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| this is how this arrangement has evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| So we have a couple thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| I thought quite a bit after the gender review committee discussion about the subject of out-of-county members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| and we generally concur with the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| We've already approached them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| We believe firmly that if you are an out-of-county member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| you should probably pay an increased rate over somebody who is an in-county member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| because you do not pay property taxes in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| It's not a great analogy, but for instance, if you live in Anderson County but you like our libraries better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| the only rewarder I have, it's not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| She will charge you a figure, I think it's $55 a year if you're an out-of-county resident and you want to use Knox County libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| So similarly, we thought your point was well taken on out-of-county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| They aren't contributing to our tax base, so if they want to use the facility, perhaps they should contribute a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| So some of those are ideas that we want to bring back before the body before next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| You can have as much discussion as you need, and we'll try to lend it in a place that I think respects all the considerations that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3222)|
| 0:53:50| And then just one quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| I guess when we met in October, I think, was that the last time I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| when the question was raised, we have roughly 90,000 children in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| and I asked what the specific number was that they had taught to sail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| and the club couldn't, at no charge to Knox County citizens, and they couldn't come up with a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| but was it a dozen kids that this past summer had free access to sailing lessons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| or is it less or more than 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| Speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| I don't know that we can give you an exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| We'd have to go back and see how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| There are a lot of kids that participate in Boy Scouts, and we accommodate the Scouts and the Sea Scouts program there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| I'm not sure if they may be paying a fee to the Scouts or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| We can go back to the Boys and Girls Clubs and others and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| if you can get the kid here for the beginning of class and take him home at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| we will furnish the sailing classes at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| Okay, but under the previous contract, there was no benefit to the children in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| You know, I think this contract was drawn up a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| There were valid reasons to say, wait a second, as you pointed out, the world has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| and I think the best thing I can tell you and all the commissioners is this is truly the club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| and the county realize things are going to change, and we're trying to work it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| Nobody's resistant to change or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| We're going to work together and make this the best it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| The time frame is an issue with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Part of it is even after we reach an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| the club may need some time to get its financial house in order for what the new world is going to be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| So I think this is more a question of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| But all the things you're bringing up, nobody from the county or the club is resistant to making changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| and making this better for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| If I could follow up, Commissioner Skinmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| one of the things we're going to send to commission this week also is a proposed change to the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| that would involve quarterly reporting from the club to Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| which would be forwarded to commission, and we just have to determine what are they reporting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| hours of instruction, number of kids that have participated, whatever that data might look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| and we'd need a little bit of time to discuss that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| This is also contextual, though, because I have to wonder if we are going to require them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| to provide free instruction to a certain number of people or a certain number of kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| is that going to extend to the numerous AYSO soccer leagues that use our facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| Is that going to extend to youth baseball teams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| Is that going to extend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| There's always a where does it start and where does it stop question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| that we want to make sure we understand before we ask a commitment or make a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| I'd add one more thing just so all the commissioners know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| A part of the cost of membership is the fee, as you have mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| but another part that applies to all members is giving a certain number of hours of volunteer time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| at the organization and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| So it's more than just money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| The members there go out and work and help keep the club operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3451)|
| 0:57:41| But was that also, though, that they get a reduced mooring fee for a sailboat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| compared to a comparable facility down further to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| where a sailboat would be docked for $250 a month where you're charging about $70 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3474)|
| 0:58:03| And so they're using those hours served to get a discount, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| Well, that is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Because you don't charge going rate for your services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| At this time we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| Please state your name and county address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| I live in the Carnes community of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| We do not charge a going rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| Part of our enjoyment of this property is sailing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| and it's a very limited sport in this part of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| If you compare the boat I bought to a very good set of golf clubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| you could use that set of golf clubs more times than I could in a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| when you consider the weather conditions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| To help attract people to the sport and hopefully enrich our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| because this is another avenue that we grow our community and enrich it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| is the fact that it doesn't cost as much to keep the boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| A lot of our members cannot use them as often just because of weather conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| There's a price point, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| If we raise it to the going rate, there's a number of the boats would probably leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| What we would do with the docks would be up for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| but we also do not provide the same level of service as the other docks do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| We don't have individual power hookups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| We don't have individual water hookups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| We don't have quite the same level of security to the docks either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| so it's not a complete apples to apples, but I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| We do have deep water slips that have value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| and our members recognize that and use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| Just a couple of last comments before this ship sails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| Get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| See what I did there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Anyway, just wanted to point out that the community partner is delivering the ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| of the current contract or the current agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| and I think it's important for us to remember that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| and so the ask are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| We are changing the ask of this organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| and so the new ask, and we discussed this at the meeting the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| will have metrics of performance standards with quarterly reports to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| and that was something that was really important to those of us who were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| attendance, and so respectfully, I've served on small boards like CYC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| and to kind of echo what Mr. Vanderveet said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| we're looking at a lot of changes and expectations that are new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| and this organization and their board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| they will need some time to implement those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| as well as the county will need time to further clarify the expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| and so respectfully, I still think five and five would be the best way to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| I just wanted to add a little color to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| I'm basically a product of the Sea Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| When I was a kid, I went to Boy Scouts, and I hated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| I don't like camping, and that's why I left the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| I still don't like camping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| So I come from a good family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| We had a small construction company, and we worked hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| and my mom wanted something for me to do so I didn't get in fights after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| school and stuff like that, so she found the Sea Scouts instead of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| Boy Scouts for me, and it's a lot more physically demanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| but it was good for a young man that had a lot of energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| I learned how to sail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| I learned how to tie knots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| I learned how to be a part of a team, borrow a crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| It was really a great experience for me, and I kind of stuck with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| and as I grew older, I grew up in the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| I grew up six houses from the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| so a lot more sailing opportunities up there than there are down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| but the summers I would work for guys, for rich guys, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| boats and would crew their boat for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| and they would give me some extra money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| but it was a great learning experience, and it gave me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| as not a rich kid, but as a middle-class kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| the opportunity to meet all these business owners and people that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| afford these beautiful yachts and boats and work with them and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| My first internship on Wall Street was from a guy that I crewed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| So, like, my opportunity in business and all the things that I learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| came from a lot of mentorship that I wouldn't have had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| to have if I wasn't a part of this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| and didn't grow up around these kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| You know, I did sports and, you know, all the rest of that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| but this was important for me to get access to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| and I think going forward, we have a lot of good points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| that there needs to be some more opportunity for any inner-city kids like myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| to be able to go out there and learn this sport and be a part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| but I don't want to discount, you know, maybe it's not like soccer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| 10,000 children, but the 100 kids that get the opportunity, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| that might make a really big impact on them like it did me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| and might give them access to people that they would normally never meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| in their neighborhoods or on their streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| So, yeah, it's a small club, and we're not in a ceiling environment down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| and we're not, you know, it's not part of our culture, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| but I wouldn't completely discount it because for a middle-class kid like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| it was a great opportunity to see more of the world and more worldly people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| and business opportunities and learn a lot of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| So this gives some kind of color to this whole situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| If you didn't know, I'd let you know that one of our Sea Scouts two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| won the highest award given in America for Sea Scouts, so he learned that at our club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| The motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| Item number 51 is regarding Ordinance O-22-12-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3865)|
| 1:04:34| and it is an ordinance amending the Knox County Code Appendix A, Zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3874)|
| 1:04:41| Article III, by adding Section 3.100, Temporary Uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| which includes use standards for temporary occupations of a recreational vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| camper, or other non-permanent habitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| and Article VI by adding Section 6.12 pertaining to a temporary use permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3899)|

| 1:05:09| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| Who really wants it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| There were three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Motion to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| with a second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| Any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| Seeing that Mr. Snowden is in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| did we get a determination on what the fee was going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| Had that been determined for the person that wants to have the temporary housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3943)|
| 1:05:51| Or just a rough idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| And this originated in the 7th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| I spoke to Andrew, the gentleman that was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Sorry I was running a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| To my understanding, we weren't planning on charging a separate fee for the temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| We would just charge the standard fee for the single-family home construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| because, in essence, the staff time we're going to put in for inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| and things is really going to be very minuscule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| so we wouldn't necessarily want to charge a separate fee unless this body wanted to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| That's what I thought you guys had determined previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| That did come up in the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| Motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| We're at other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4014)|
| 1:07:07| Item number 52, discussion item to discuss the implementation of a county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| ongoing continuing education monthly series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| In an effort to stay informed and expand our knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| I would like to ask the body's consideration to schedule monthly continuing education sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| These would take place in the commission conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| They would be one day per month, approximately one to two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| dependent upon the topic or subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| They're completely voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| They would be for information purposes only, would be public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| and some examples would be we could bring people in from the internal county department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| CTAS, schools, any community partners or agencies that we work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| other county leaders, emergency service agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| It's really just an opportunity to have access to agencies, groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| folks that we actually conduct business with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| and just continue to kind of fine tune our knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| Who would be the one taking on this task?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| Madam Chair would be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| Right, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Any discussion or any questions for Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| I would just ask that just consideration of the timing of these be as close to the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| We have so many meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| We have so many committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| We have so many applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| It is very difficult to continue to take more and more time off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| so having them closer to non-work time would be much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4134)|
| 1:09:04| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| Is this designed for educational purposes or just to meet the people in the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| It is for educational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| For instance, we could bring in someone from planning staff to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| and just expand our knowledge of what to look for for rezoning or sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4163)|
| 1:09:32| just things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Also bringing in our emergency service agencies, they can talk to us about our relationship with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| our agreements with them, what they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| We can also bring in folks from CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| It really is just to keep our knowledge sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| Again, I would ask all of you, if you would like a subject matter or a topic to be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| please send that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| Like I said, I was just keeping this very informal, but I'm a constant learner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| and I feel like things are always changing, and if there's opportunity for us to expand our knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| I think we should go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| I remember when Commissioner Andrade was chair, he did this also and was monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| so I don't know if you want to consider every other month just because it does kind of get back to back to back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| but I'll support you either way it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| I just wanted to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| Just as a consideration, I don't really know what this might look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| but there may be other people or other bodies outside of the commissioners that could also benefit from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4248)|
| 1:10:57| Maybe even within Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| there may be some that would like to straddle and learn from other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4259)|
| 1:11:07| Any more discussion on this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| Item 53, discussion item of the incident involving Knox County Sheriff's Office and 15-year-old teenager at McAllister's Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4276)|
| 1:11:25| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| First and foremost, I do want to thank Rick Roach, if he's still here, and Will and Calvin for coming out and speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4289)|

| 1:11:46| And when I left the last commission meeting, I think people pretty much know it's pretty much frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4306)|
| 1:11:53| And I left here in tears, and my mom was like, watch your blood pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| So I got to do better, but it's hard because I feel like my voice is not valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4319)|
| 1:12:08| As a woman, as a leader, as a black woman leader, which I call the triple threat in society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4328)|
| 1:12:18| I did ask for the sheriff's office, I did contact Sheriff Spangler on January 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4338)|
| 1:12:27| asking for the officers that were involved at the McAllister's location who were, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4347)|
| 1:12:38| responsible for the loss of Aniyah Thompson, 15-year-old child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4358)|
| 1:12:47| who just so happened to be the sister of Anthony Thompson, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| who was shot by Knoxville City Police in the bathroom of a local high school, Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4373)|
| 1:13:02| which is one of the predominantly black high schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| Rick Roach was the one that brought this to my attention, so I'm definitely double grateful for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| And what went through my mind, I'm like, how ironic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| I'd seen the Facebook post before I knew the details, and then I learned it was Aniyah Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| I'm like, how does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| How, like, two years ago, her brother was shot, we're dealing with the police and law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| black community thing, and then she comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| lost her job because of a different department, but still law enforcement with the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| I feel like it was a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| It's a sign that we have to face what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| It's day after Martin Luther King Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4435)|

| 1:14:02| But in my spirit, it feels like 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| I did receive a response because I know people was contacting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| Have you heard from the sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| I will read his email that I received this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| Commissioner Lundy, happy new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| I am receipt of both your email and letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| I am unavailable to attend the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Additionally, my officers nor any other Knox County Sheriff's Office representatives will be attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4467)|
| 1:14:36| However, if you wish to make an appointment to meet in person, I will be happy to accommodate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4476)|
| 1:14:44| If you would like a copy of our social media policy, one can be obtained by emailing Puppet Records custodian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4484)|
| 1:14:52| He gave me the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| I just want to publicly say I'm not meeting in a private meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| I asked for this on November 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| Before I wrote the statement, when I found out that she lost her job, I texted the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4504)|
| 1:15:13| Can we fix this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| I know this is a big misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| I'm just thinking, can we just apologize, do something real quick and get her job back, and then we can, you know, just let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4518)|
| 1:15:26| That's not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| He just wanted me to let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| So I did it for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| I was making a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| I wrote my statement, which was published in the media outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| This is the first conversation through email that I had with him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4536)|
| 1:15:44| And then they don't have the, what's the word I'm looking for, the guts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| What's another word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Y'all can help me with a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| No guts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| You're right, no guts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| No guts to show up when a 15-year-old was put on trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| She came at the last meeting and stated her case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4563)|
| 1:16:11| But here we go again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| No one cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| I can't help but to believe that if any other of my commissioners would have requested them to come, would they have come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4574)|
| 1:16:22| Or, furthermore, if they didn't look like Hania Thompson, would we even be here having this conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4582)|
| 1:16:31| These are real words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| Most of the emails I received were from white, middle-aged women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| They're the ones telling me it's racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| I'm trying not to use the R word because when I say racism as a black woman, I'm overreacting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| So I just let everybody else say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Is it racism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| Was this targeted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| People believe it's targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| She knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| I mean, people knew at the McAllister shop that she was Anthony Thompson's sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| Did someone behind the scenes say she works here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| Make sure you read the article that comes out in Knox New Sentinel tomorrow about her story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| She's a woman with goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| She's way braver than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| She wants to be an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| She gets to remember, at 15 years old, I lost my first job because officers said that I denied them service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4650)|
| 1:17:43| Oh, poor officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| Oh, 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| We dealt with that as black people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| We deal with it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| We don't post it on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| One argument one would say from the sheriff's office, they never said her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| They never said how old she was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| But guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| When she was still at work, some one of her co-workers seen that post, and that broke her down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4688)|
| 1:18:19| A few minutes later, after having that incident, how does a 15-year-old post a process that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| You let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| How does she post a process that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Again, she's getting damaged on social media, on trial, like she created the biggest thing in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4711)|
| 1:18:40| But no one from that office, from the sheriff's office, decided to, you know, let's sit back on this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4720)|
| 1:18:49| Let's analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Is this real?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| It's very cowardly, and it's very disrespectful, and it's very racist to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| So since they didn't show up, it don't hurt my feelings, because guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| I knew they weren't going to show, because bullies never show up when it's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4744)|
| 1:19:12| I want to thank my team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| I would not name them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| But I came up with another draft solution, and I will be contacting the law office to make sure if I need to make any amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4755)|
| 1:19:25| But it is about our subpoena power as a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| To subpoena the officers involved, then also Sheriff Spangler, communication director Kimberly Glenn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4771)|
| 1:19:39| and all the records and communications that happened between that time and December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| I did not want to go this route, but my love and grace gets the best of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| I just wrote a simple letter hoping that people will come, have their statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| because it's only fair that when there's more than one party involved, everybody has a right to speak, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| I believe that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| I didn't want to put my commissioners in position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| I need a two-thirds vote to even subpoena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| And I know that it gets very sensitive, and not targeting anybody on this committee, but I just know how society is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| It gets very sensitive when it comes to the black community and law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| So I didn't want to bring my commissioners into a point that they have to vote in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| But, you know, I'm going to have to do it, because she will never forget this, ever in her life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4829)|
| 1:20:40| She will carry this for the rest of her life, because people are insecure, and they're bullies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4840)|
| 1:20:55| I'm disgusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| I won't let this go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4857)|

| 1:21:12| And let us remember, just because Aniyah Thompson looks like me, she's our child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| She's Knox County's child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| And we were voted to protect the people and the citizens of Knox County, especially young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4881)|
| 1:21:35| I want to thank God for giving us this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4895)|

| 1:22:01| Commissioner Fraser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Mr. Moyers, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| Is it customary that a commissioner go through the open records process to obtain a county department's policies and procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4929)|
| 1:22:19| Customary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| I don't know that it's customary or not customary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| I'm not that familiar with situations where the commission has asked for records from an elected office holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4943)|
| 1:22:33| I would like to think that an elected office holder would provide the records to the commission or to a commissioner if asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4953)|
| 1:22:42| but they are constitutional officers and they can set their own policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| So I guess that would answer my next question about is it left up to the individual departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| the decision to make their policies and procedures, or in this case general orders, public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| There are, of course, different departments in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| Some of them come under the county mayor, most of them do, but others are constitutionally elected officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| and they are given a fair amount of latitude to operate their departments in the manner they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| I have an open question for Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| If you pursue the subpoena route, do you also intend to subpoena Aniyah, the co-worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5005)|
| 1:23:34| and the manager of McAllister Stalley's OL?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| I did not include Aniyah, but it will be the CEO of Southern Rock Restaurants and the area manager of McAllister's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5019)|
| 1:23:48| I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| The Southern Rock Restaurants CEO and the area manager of McAllister's, but I did not include Aniyah on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5029)|
| 1:23:58| I guess I'm curious as to why, if you want to get to the entire story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| and you've referenced both her and her co-worker and the manager and the officers and Ms. Glenn and the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5041)|
| 1:24:09| wouldn't you want everyone to be testifying to their side of the story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| Well, I mean, that's fine, but I figure Aniyah Thompson gave her testimony in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| Why put her through that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| But here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| We've got to put the 15-year-old on trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| So if that's what is recommended, I would do that, and I would talk to her how she feels about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| She's very strong, so she'd be okay, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| I don't want to speak for her, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| But she's already stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| I just want to make clear, as people are probably watching, she did make her statement on what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| the last commission meeting, and also she will, I think, in the newspaper tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| her statement will be included in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| I just have a few comments to make, and I guess I want to feel, I guess I want to be like Paul Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5095)|
| 1:25:02| What's the rest of the story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| What hasn't been brought out in any of these questions, the stuff that's been going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| is Ms. Thompson's brother that was shot was shot because he brought a gun to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5111)|
| 1:25:19| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Talk about what you know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| I'm speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| He was shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| I think this is destroying our community, and this is destroying the relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| This is not about race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| Three hundred and thirty-one officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| I understand you're upset, but please refrain from speaking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| Three hundred and thirty-one officers were killed in our country last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| Two thousand and twenty-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| Sixty-four officers were shot dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| We've got a lot going on with gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| Now, Ms. Thompson was not fired because this was not a race issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| Officers went into an establishment, a restaurant that's privately owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| and if that restaurant wants to have a policy, we give law enforcement a meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| they're free to do that, just like any business is free to give a Boy Scouts anything, Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5189)|
| 1:26:39| I just wonder if the victim advocate that spoke to us last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| how much therapy or counseling did they help Ms. Thompson when she lost her brother?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5204)|
| 1:26:52| Maybe they needed to do some counseling then to help her get through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| Maybe they should have done some counseling then to see what she needed to be able to work in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5216)|
| 1:27:03| She didn't have to work at McAllister's, so all we're hearing is she was fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| My point is not saying that, you know, it's unfortunate what happened to Ms. Thompson's brother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5229)|
| 1:27:16| or that she lost her job, but she was free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| She had the liberty to not work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| And if McAllister's says we give free meals to officers, if you don't want to honor that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5242)|
| 1:27:29| then go work at McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| To come in here and make it a race issue to this commission, to divide our community and make this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| this is not about race. This is about respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| They came in there to get a meal that they are customary giving a meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| and she was fired because she didn't want to uphold McAllister's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| And then we want to make it a race issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| I mean, when it calls for race, let's make it an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| This was not a race issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| I mean, I'm just sorry that we're talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| 1960s? There's nothing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| There is no proof that this girl was fired because she was black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| She was working at McAllister's. She didn't have to work at McAllister's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| But for her to not, to get fired because she didn't uphold McAllister's, says we give that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5301)|
| 1:28:28| and then they were told one of your employees didn't serve us, they fired her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| I mean, how is this a county commission issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| I don't understand. This is just dividing our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| I'm just, I don't see why, if we're going to put Ms. Thompson, this is something she is going to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| but I hope she doesn't remember that every time something happens in her life, to use a race card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5329)|
| 1:28:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| I'm going to call up Rick Roach to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5339)|

| 1:29:06| And anybody else on this county commission that even thinks that anything...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5346)|
| 1:29:14| Sir, I apologize, but we do have to follow our commission rules and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| Okay, fine. I'm going to address the issue. Here's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| Sir...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| Three county deputies come into McAllister's on that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| I apologize. You haven't been recognized by the chair, and Commissioner Lundy, I apologize for this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| That's fine. I don't know what to do in this situation to recognize Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5374)|

| 1:29:46| This is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| Commissioner...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| I didn't call this a race issue. It looks like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| But let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| The people who call it racism look like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| They ain't look like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| They look like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| And I'm so sorry that you feel the way you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| But as a woman, I know I have to respect your comments, but I totally disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5416)|
| 1:30:24| I think they're inconsiderate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| First of all, Aniyah has been in counseling for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| Second of all, she's homeschooled, and she wanted a job because she needed friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| She wanted friends. She wanted to be in society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| We are insensitive as hell in this county, and I will continue to say we are freaking 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| I am complete, because if I say anything else, I'm going to end up cussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| Put that in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5451)|

| 1:31:21| because, you know, sometimes we get arrested for speaking out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| We don't want that to happen. I appreciate you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5485)|

| 1:32:10| And guess what? A 15-year-old was trying to pick herself up by the bootstraps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| and she got fired because somebody got insensitive about her not serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5534)|

| 1:32:36| Discussion item regarding the time and date for zoning meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| This afternoon, Commissioner Daley chaired the Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| and in discussion we were looking at ways to possibly change some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| meeting times for some of the meetings that we are required to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5575)|
| 1:33:03| One of the late suggestions was that possibly moving the zoning meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5583)|
| 1:33:12| to a different day and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| The idea was, what if we held the zoning meetings on the second Monday of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5595)|
| 1:33:24| at 6 o'clock p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| Okay, 6 o'clock p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| We also, in the same discussion, came up with the idea that on the work session day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5613)|
| 1:33:41| at 4 o'clock p.m. prior to the 5 o'clock meeting time, we would hold the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| since there's no state statute that says you have to meet, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| the third or fourth Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| So that way, on the commission meeting night, if we meet at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| we can continue on business and not having to stop in the middle of county business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| to do zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| So they asked that we put it on for discussion to hear from the balance of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5652)|
| 1:34:20| that weren't members of the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5660)|
| 1:34:28| Any discussion regarding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| I'm just going to speak from the hip here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| I would not be a fan of three out of four Monday nights being here on this dais.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5681)|
| 1:34:51| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| I do support the moving of the beer board to coincide at 4 o'clock on the work session day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5696)|
| 1:35:09| as opposed to doing it on the same day as we do our general meeting and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5709)|
| 1:35:21| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| I would be in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| I'm definitely in favor of the beer board moving before the work sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| When I think back of all the meetings, at least for the last couple, two, three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| a minimum half of them we have stopped our regular meeting to then go to zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| and then come back to our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| And I think about staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| I think about other people in the public that are then waiting through all of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| to get back to it, even the public forum at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| I think it's hard to say add another day altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| However, I would much rather have three Mondays with shorter time frames than to have what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5760)|
| 1:36:08| seems inevitable that we have our commission meetings running 7, 8, 9, 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5768)|
| 1:36:15| A couple years we had it 11, 12, 1 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| And mostly because we have a block of at least an hour for zonings, if not more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| If choosing three days, shorter time frame versus two days that are much longer, I'll take the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5785)|
| 1:36:33| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| I personally like the shorter time frames, three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| I do believe if I go to the many, many homeowners groups that I go to and tell them that they're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5801)|
| 1:36:49| on a Monday at 6 o'clock, it's them and them only, they're going to love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| They will absolutely love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| They will finally say, thank goodness, I don't have to be here until 9, 10, or 11 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| They'll love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| They'll absolutely love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| And if today in the Rules Committee we've heard we're here to serve the public, well, let's serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| Let's give the zonings on a Monday night, starts at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| We should be, we'll be here at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| It won't be long hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| So if we're really here to serve the public, let's serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Let's give the zoning people what they deserve, the time that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| So I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| And I think it'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| It's a great idea, moving the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| Thank you, Commissioner Oster, for coming up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| Too bad we didn't think about it six years ago or eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| That's great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| You're just waiting on me, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Yeah, well, that's why when you have new people come on and you've got rules, you go in and you get new ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5869)|
| 1:37:58| No, Commissioner Schoonmaker is the oldest one here as far as turning eight years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| I'm at six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Who else is at six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| So it took someone new to think out of the box and say, let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5890)|
| 1:38:17| Well, let's think out of the box and serve the zoning people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| So I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| I just kind of want to echo what Commissioner Daly said, that hopefully everybody likes the idea of the beer board workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5906)|
| 1:38:35| I think it makes it a little bit easier for everybody, but also make it to where whatever we do as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| we always want to make sure that it is the best for our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| and that they always know that they have the opportunity to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| So how that looks for me, I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5927)|
| 1:38:54| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Just some questions I want to ask about specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| Was there consideration given as to which Monday night it would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| The second Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| Okay, but would it still be the previous month's planning commission agenda that we would receive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Just be a shorter turnaround time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| It's actually two weeks short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Well, like for instance, they met last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| We wouldn't hear it until the 2nd of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| So it's almost four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| Just asking for those who probably are wondering, who aren't speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| so I guess I'm speaking for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| Was there a reason why we wouldn't start it at the same time we start all of our other meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5983)|
| 1:39:51| Why 6 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Right, yeah, why 6 o'clock if there's no other meeting that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| We're up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| That's why we have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| So there was nothing in concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| Right, yeah, it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| But 5 would be good because, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| I would suggest 6 because most people get off at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| I would suggest 6 because most people get off at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| They've got time to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| And so that's why I would say 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| So it's up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| Yeah, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| I mean, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| I see where you're coming from, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| I don't think that's any more important than a county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| And I would think 5 o'clock just seems more reasonable if it's the only meeting that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| No, no worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| I'm more of the opinion pack everything into one day than spread out versus multiple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| Like, I'd rather start at 9 o'clock in the morning and at every single meeting take one day of the whole entire month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6059)|
| 1:41:06| have one session in the morning, one session in the afternoon, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| But I'm more of the opinion of, like, just stack it all up, one full day a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| Work session in the morning, you can do commission in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| Just take one day and do it like that instead of trying to spread it all out all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| We can also have lunch together like a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| It would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| I don't go quite as extreme as Commissioner Ward, but I will say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6093)|
| 1:41:39| Do you want to have lunch with me every month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| Any time, darling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| Any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| But I am a little bit reluctant to tie up a third night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| I am not real personally not real comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| And one reason is because we all have many other commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| And to basically tie up, you know, three Mondays a month instead of two could tend to be a little bit more limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6121)|
| 1:42:12| So, again, I absolutely support moving the beer board to workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| Really, it would be tough, Commissioner Ward, to have workshop and general meeting in the same day, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6139)|
| 1:42:27| But I would not support going into a third night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6147)|
| 1:42:36| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| One consideration that the body should think about is our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| County staff would need to be here three Mondays in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| That's something that why just two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6169)|
| 1:42:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| It would just be one director of one department for our zoning meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| Mr. Snowden, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| And Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| And Ms. Brooks, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| Okay, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| But it wouldn't be the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| And the clerk's office staff and the county commission office staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| And the law director's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| How about Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| I mean, I'm not opposed to just a full day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| Kumbaya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| Yeah, let's Super Monday it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Super Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Well, let me give you another scenario to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| What if, based on conversations if you just wanted to meet two times a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| you've made kind of everybody's kind of agreed potentially that the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| should move to the third Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| Or the fourth Monday of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| what if you had commission meetings start at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| and zonings at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| And that way we would with the other option would be then at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| of that four to seven period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| we do the presentations and honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| So you immediately start county business right at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6254)|
| 1:44:22| I see a lot of shaking heads, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Yeah, that doesn't sound bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| So my next question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| would it be appropriate for the chairman of the rules committee to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| resolution together for next Monday night to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6271)|
| 1:44:38| And then we wouldn't take effect until, say, March meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| And, again, we're in a discussion period here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| I like the idea of starting at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| That would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| As far as getting a resolution together, that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| Hi, Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| Jill can probably get that done between now and Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| It could be an ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| Two-thirds vote and you could add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| And we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Is that not too short of a – because, you know, today's Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Is that not too short of a time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| For what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| To add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| To add – to get – I'm looking – I'm really asking Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6311)|
| 1:45:17| No, we could add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| We could add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| We can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Yeah, we can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| There's stuff being added the day of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| No, we can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| So, you know, the only question is, Mr. –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| it does not have to go through the Rules Committee, this change, or would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| Then we should – I guess we'd make a motion to have a resolution drawn up to be added next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6337)|
| 1:45:44| And we can discuss it even further next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| Jill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| I have another comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| Why don't we move the beer board meeting first, see how that goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6359)|
| 1:46:05| and then take a little more time to think about the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| Because also it's quite comical to even say this, that commission is considered a part-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6369)|
| 1:46:19| Many of the body have full-time employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| So that should also be a consideration, just putting on my HR hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| So we've got several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| I would just like to maybe throw out, let's move the beer board first, see how that goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| and then take a little more time to think about the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| and confer with county staff and everyone have time to give their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| With that idea, I think maybe stick with the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| and then maybe try to do the resolution for the meeting change time for February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| because next week is already going to be jam-packed and a very long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6416)|
| 1:47:04| And that's just a friendly suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| And one other consideration also, if we start looking into other dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| is scheduling of this room, which is about impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6435)|
| 1:47:24| Any more discussion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| Yeah, I love this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| The more discussion we've got, the more minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| It works better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| I withdraw my motion, if the second will, and give Jill time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| Let's talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| But we can do the motion for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| Yeah, do the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| I did the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| Mine was for moving the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| So you're making a motion to have the beer board the third Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| at 4 o'clock prior to the work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| Mr. Oster can make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| It's her idea, so she gets the credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| I want to take credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| I will make that motion to do a resolution for beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| to be the third Monday of the month, starting at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| So if Jill could get that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Would that go into effect in February, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| So we're going to not have beer board, or will it do it next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| We will do it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| So we will have it next week, but next month will be on the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| It would probably go into effect what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| Motion on the floor is to add a resolution to our agenda for Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6525)|
| 1:48:53| changing beer board time, or the beer board meeting date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| from the fourth Monday of the month to the third Monday of the month at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| Motion is by Commissioner Oster, with a second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| Effective March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| We are to the zoning portion of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| Commissioners, I asked Jim Snowden and Amy Brooks to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| and give us a brief overview of the planned development zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| since it is the first one we have ever experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| And so they will approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6585)|
| 1:49:55| Welcome back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| Good evening, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| Good to see you all as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| I've tried to distill this 10-page section of the code down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| and just hit the highlights for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| As was stated, you all have yet to see one of these come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| It was initially introduced in 2019 and officially adopted in 2020 by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6618)|
| 1:50:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| Now I can hear myself too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| I'm going to give you an overview of the purpose of the planned development section of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| as well as an overview of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| So the purpose of the planned development approval process is to provide an optional process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| for approval of projects that may not fit within the bounds of the standard zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| established by the zoning code but still meet the intent of adopted plans or policies of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| It's authorized in all districts and parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| but they must be located in the planned growth area of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| and must be a minimum of 10 acres total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| In return for exceptions to the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| the process requires higher standards for design and a commitment of benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| that are not required in other zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| So to summarize, encourage and allow more creative and flexible development of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| than is possible under the district's zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| So in return for this flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| applications must demonstrate the elevated design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| and provide compensating amenities or benefits to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| In addition to the elevated design and compensating benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| all exceptions to the code for the proposed development are required to satisfy all of the following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6707)|
| 1:51:53| and this is in Article 6.8005B of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6713)|
| 1:51:58| So enhance the overall merit of the planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| promote the objectives of both Knox County as well as the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| enhance the quality of design of any structures or site plan as proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| will not cause excessive adverse impact on neighboring properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| and must further the goals of adopted plans of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| in particular the general plan and any of its component parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| It must provide a public benefit for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| So in no case may an exception to the district regulations be granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| unless the application demonstrates a substantial benefit to the Knox County community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| These benefits must be determined during the review of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| and ultimately approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| Benefits may include, there's a list in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| I'll just briefly highlight these and encourage you all to take a look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| Community gathering spaces and amenities that might include plazas, public art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| formal gardens, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| Improvement of existing on-site and off-site infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| Use of sustainable design and architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| Preservation of existing environmental features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| Preservation of historic features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Any sort of adaptive reuse of existing buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| so it doesn't have to be a site plan per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| New open space and recreational amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| Affordable housing set-asides, senior housing set-asides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| and land set-aside for public facilities such as schools, libraries, emergency services, or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| So in return for allowing flexibility, the plan development provisions require this higher standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| for protection and preservation of environmentally sensitive lands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| well-planned living, working, shopping environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| and assurance of adequately timed provision of essential utilities and streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| All exceptions to the underlying zoning district and design standards must meet several criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6819)|
| 1:53:45| They must equal or exceed the standard objectives that are already in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| They must not impair the reasonable long-term use of other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| And they must implement policies of the Knox County General Plan or other policies adopted by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6833)|
| 1:53:59| Applicants are required to identify all exceptions to the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| and provide a specific justification for each part of the application process and any of those exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6842)|
| 1:54:09| So to the approval process, there's a three-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| The first step is a pre-application consultation prior to submitting a formal application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| A pre-application meeting is required with planning and Knox County Engineering and Public Works staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| The second step is a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| So before submitting a formal application to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| they must present a concept plan to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| for the purpose strictly of just obtaining information and feedback from that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| And so the third step is this preliminary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| and this is the first official application for a plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| It's filed with planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| It goes before the planning commission for review and consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| and the planning commission is tasked with reviewing that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| based upon the evidence presented at that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| as part of the application for compliance with all sections of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| So the planning commission has several options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| They can recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| They can approve with conditions or additional modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| or they can deny the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| If it is approved, it's then forwarded to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| and once you all receive it, you will review the recommendations of the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| similar to all other applications you receive from that body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| and you must approve as recommended, approve with conditions or modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| or you have the option to deny the preliminary plan as submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| Approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| I think it's important to note that approval of exemptions to the dimensional design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| or any of the use standards of the underlying zone as part of the plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| require justification for them to be specifically stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| So that's why it's important for the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| to also be sure to state the rationale for their exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| And county commission can impose conditions, restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| but these restrictions must be reflected in their final plan or any other conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| and you have 120 days to act on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| So the final plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| The planning staff and Knox County Engineering and Public Works staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| will review the final plan for compliance with the preliminary plan approval of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| If it is in substantial compliance, staff will approve the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| If it is not, the applicant will have the opportunity to revise their plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| to ensure compliance, or request reconsideration by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| The planning commission has the option to approve or deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| If it is denied, the applicant must resubmit a preliminary plan application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| and go back through the process, which includes coming before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| So key questions that I would recommend that you all ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| as part of any plan development review is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| does the project meet the broader goals of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| including the general plan or any other adopted plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| Do the exemptions requested meet the requirements per the article?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| And that's 6.805B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| And do the benefits or amenities proposed for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| justify the exemptions requested to the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| So that is my brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| Happy to entertain any questions, as well as I'm sure Director Snowden is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| Amy, welcome back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| There had been some questions about the conditions that planning puts on an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7040)|
| 1:57:29| Is it legal or not legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| Will it hold up in court or not hold up in court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| We do know it will when it comes to us, because we can put those conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| the same conditions or more conditions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| So we approve and it goes back to concept or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| If you put more, if they put more conditions on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| and they're not approved by the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| will it hold up in court, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| Do you understand what I'm trying to get to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| I don't know if you approve it with the conditions that have been set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| I don't know that the Planning Commission can put more conditions on it, can they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| Or can they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| They cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| I didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| You said that when they come back with that plan, you can make them change that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7087)|
| 1:58:15| So you wouldn't have conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| You would make them change the plan some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| Only to change the plan to ensure that they're in compliance with any conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| that are put on the plan by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| And the point of that final plan is to make sure that what they submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| and what was approved during the preliminary plan stage is what is actually on their final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| So it's just an additional check before they get any kind of permits to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| So when we get a plan development in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| we better have our ducks in a row that we know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7124)|
| 1:58:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| Any more discussion or questions, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| Ms. Brooks, welcome back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| And we're specifically talking about just plan development, not the number 66 on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| We're just talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| Just plan development, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| So would it behoove a development company to have each one of their ducks in a row| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7155)|
| 1:59:23| prior to them coming for approval from county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| because they will only appear to us one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| They will only come before this body once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| So if someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7177)|
| 1:59:44| I guess we're going to discuss this later on the agenda, number 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7184)|
| 1:59:50| Are we going to go through each one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you pulled them from consent, so if that's your will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| Well, hang around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| I'll have a question for you when it comes up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| Any more discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| Preliminary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| I think we're going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| Do we need to read it or shall we just hear from our?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| Should we just do the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| And she doesn't have to read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| District commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| You drew the short stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| My number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| Oh, wow, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| This is going to have the appearance of being identical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| to an item we had before us last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| However, in my opinion, it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| And I can state the whole case if you want me to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| but in my opinion, there is some justification for a two-per-acre density on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| for the simple reason that, just like the one that was before us last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7259)|
| 2:01:05| that was sort of on top of a ridge, this one's on top of a different ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7265)|
| 2:01:13| Am I speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| Yeah, you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7277)|
| 2:01:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| You were kind of looking at me like I was saying the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| No, I'm listening to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| No, no, I'm listening to what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| Okay, okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| There are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| I was getting that look, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| You know, there are three ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| I want to ask you to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| Yes, there are three ridges in northeast Knox County that run parallel to one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7297)|
| 2:01:42| Beaver Ridge, Black Oak Ridge, and McAnally Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| McAnally Ridge and Beaver Ridge are not buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| You can drive up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| On the tops of those ridges, there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| Maybe one house in who knows how far of a distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7313)|
| 2:01:58| Black Oak Ridge is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| It's completely developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| In fact, there is a road, a main road, that runs the length of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| throughout the Gibbs community, Ridgeview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| It is rural residential, if I've ever seen rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| The lot sizes on Ridgeview Road are varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| They're all shapes and sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7340)|
| 2:02:21| Many of them are a greater density than one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| Just by simple reason of the topography, the buildability, if that's a word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7348)|
| 2:02:36| of where this is, I think that what the applicant is asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7356)|
| 2:02:44| which is rural residential with the potential of up to two per acre, is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7364)|
| 2:02:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| Do you think they need to make a sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| I think, and I don't know if Ms. Brooks is still here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| but I believe that in order to get PR at two per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| they have to have a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| Commissioner Frazier, isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| Yeah, in order to get to two per acre, they would have to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| And the reason I believe it would be justified is the same reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| the Planning Commission said it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| because it's consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| This should be rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| I grew up on Ridgeview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| I mean, I lived there for, you know, 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| Yes, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| The land use classification in rural residential allows PR at one dual per acre clustered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7418)|
| 2:03:45| and the applicant is asking for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| So I'm glad you brought up your comments because I was going to bring attention to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| this is very much like the one we had last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| and I considered a spot plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| which I don't like to amend sector plans very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| especially when we're going through advanced NOCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| and they will probably identify that area, as you stated, for a little bit more density thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7444)|
| 2:04:11| But I'll follow my district commissioner on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| We are to item number 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7464)|
| 2:04:32| I have no comment about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| I've not been contacted directly by the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| I believe, though, and I don't have my note in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| that it's a very, very small parcel, one and a half acres or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7480)|
| 2:04:46| So I'm not inclined to have any objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7486)|
| 2:04:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Item number 57, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7494)|
| 2:05:02| I haven't heard anything on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| I'm actually going to be reaching out to Ben Mullins tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| but I haven't gotten any feedback on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7509)|
| 2:05:16| Commissioner Schoomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| This is where the other half of the car wash is, behind Sam's Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| Who was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| He's making fun of me over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| If anybody wants any information on any of the zoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| I have all of that because I nerd out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| And it's Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| It's a small parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| It's .4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| It's a commercial node, and it aligns with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7547)|
| 2:05:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Item number 58, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7558)|
| 2:06:06| This property, I think, is adjacent to Hunter Valley Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| And, of course, we know about the flooding issues that they've had there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| where Hunter Valley lost their whole meeting space was, what, 12 inches under or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7575)|
| 2:06:23| which is very sad, but, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| Commissioner Ward, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| This is in the urban growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| There is a curve there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| There's also some considerations of a no-fill line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| They've suggested limited rezoning because of significant flooding events in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7598)|
| 2:06:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| Item 59, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| Actually, items 59 and 60 are related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| I believe, if memory serves me correct, this is also another very small parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| However, it's important that we bring to the attention of the applicant that this is in the town of Farragut urban growth boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7629)|
| 2:07:18| and the applicant will need to be aware, if they choose to subdivide in the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| that it should be dedicated for future improvements of Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| And if the applicant wants to access additional access, it will need to be approved by the Farragut Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7648)|
| 2:07:34| So we'll have to make sure that they're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| I was not aware that was in the town limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| You're all not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| It is a small parcel, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| It's .97 acres, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Yeah, that's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| Can we have Commissioner Fraser just go through all of them for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| Just give us a presentation in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| I think that would be the most adequate use of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| One, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| I don't know if the next five are Commissioner Oster's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| I'd kind of like to hear what she has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| Just have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| Are we on 61?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| I do have an issue on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| We actually had a community meeting, had about 45 neighbors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| This is along Jenkins Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| All Jenkins Road is single-family homes or neighborhoods of single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7705)|
| 2:08:30| The builder has talked about possibly doing duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7710)|
| 2:08:38| The neighbors are actually happy if he wanted to even do more single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7718)|
| 2:08:46| They just don't want the duplexes there because it really does change the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7726)|
| 2:08:52| I do want to get this on the record, and I will say this next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| I am a personal property rights person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| I felt like my people on Jenkins were being extremely reasonable to him on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7740)|
| 2:09:08| because it does change the landscape, and it also changes the value of their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| Jenkins Road has no—I know that the width is okay, but it has no side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7753)|
| 2:09:21| It's just complete drop-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| We have to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| I'm not—on up to the five dwellings, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| Commissioner Frazier, if you want to jump in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| One thing that was interesting on this one is there's actually a residential charter of Jenkins Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| which I've never seen before, but it actually caps density at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| To Commissioner Oster's point, low density in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| It's a low population density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| There's single-family residential on all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| Sadly, in a rezoning, we can't dictate to them what they can build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7793)|
| 2:09:58| but you can reflect that in your motion for density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| You still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| I'll just say that, by the way, Commissioner Oster did her first angry neighbor meeting as commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7806)|
| 2:10:15| Did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| We were in a church, so I said everybody needed to be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| I'm going to do a church every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| Can we go zoom up just a smidge on the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| This is over off of Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| There has already been a zoning for four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| However, this is another situation that I have heard from numerous, numerous neighbors on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| Fox Road, if anybody knows it well, any of us West commissioners do know that Fox Road is very narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7850)|
| 2:10:59| and you cannot turn left off of Fox Road onto Kingston Park unless it's like 2 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7859)|
| 2:11:06| So they have to kind of go up and around and go through parking lots and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| So I feel a little bit more comfortable going lower units per acre on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7870)|
| 2:11:17| and so that's kind of another situation that I've got in that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| and Commissioner Frazier can speak to that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| I should just let her just speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| No, I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| Just give her all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7891)|
| 2:11:32| Give her all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| This one I have not heard much about on this one, but I will let Commissioner Frazier speak to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7904)|
| 2:11:51| That's 63 and 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| Okay, 63 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| It's 11.04 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| It is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| There was a previous request in 2001 for PR at four, and they're requesting 12, staff approved 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7919)|
| 2:12:08| and it does align with existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| 64 is also Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| That's the rezoning Ag to PR 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| Again, it aligns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| Getting into 65, this kind of ties into the appeal that Mr. Moyer surprised me with the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7940)|
| 2:12:27| that a no motion is an approval because that's not what that body wanted at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7947)|
| 2:12:35| This does not align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| It failed to receive a motion to approve a certificate of appropriateness at TTCDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| because the body felt that it did not align with existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| So I disagree with staff and planning commission on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7967)|
| 2:12:52| Sorry, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| And I would respectfully support what came out of TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7974)|
| 2:13:04| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7984)|
| 2:13:05| Since I spoke to you about this, the appeal last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7985)|
| 2:13:14| the reasoning for it to be approved is because they took no action at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| And if they did not want this, the action should have been to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| Section 1434 requires the authority within 60 days of the application to either approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8004)|
| 2:13:31| approve with conditions, or deny with reason stated in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8011)|
| 2:13:37| Section B says failure by the authority to act on application within the time herein| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| shall constitute approval of the certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| So that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| If they just moved to deny it and given their reasons, because they can't just arbitrarily say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| They have to give reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| But because they didn't do those things, under the rule, it's considered approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| Yeah, there was no one there to advise us of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| And the chair did not advise anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| And they just felt like it wasn't appropriate to be brought before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| I don't know who's supposed to be the legal counsel for TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| It's been a while since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| So maybe the body can request the law directors start covering their meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8052)|
| 2:14:18| or maybe Ms. Blankney can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| I was unaware that they were meeting without legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| Regardless of what they did or didn't do, this rezoning is still before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| It's the appeal, but the rezoning is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| Commissioner Oser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| Are we still on me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| I thought I was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| So, Mr. Law Director, do I hear you saying that the governing body for this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8095)|
| 2:15:11| still can deny it because it's within a 60-day period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8111)|
| 2:15:19| Well, that deals with the TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| I'm assuming, and I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| but I'm assuming that more than 60 days have passed since the matter was taken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| If the TTCDA could meet on it still within the 60-day period and take some action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8130)|
| 2:15:38| then they would still have the jurisdiction to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| But they lose that jurisdiction after 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| I don't know when the application was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| But, like I said, all that does is take the certificate of appropriateness out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| This body still has the authority to pass on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| And to your comment, Commissioner Frazier, your statement is their intent was to deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8155)|
| 2:16:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| Mr. Morris, could you reach out to the chair of TTCDA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| I honestly don't even know who it is, but I'll try to find out and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| Okay. I can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| Commissioner Frazier, will you explain to me how the appeal affects this particular rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8183)|
| 2:16:33| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| It's two separate instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| All we can look at, we have to look at them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| You cannot look at them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| Any more discussion on 65?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| If I may, to your question, however, sometimes on situations like this where we do not have familiarity with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8215)|
| 2:17:06| we may tend to agree with whatever the recommendation was from the planning body on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8226)|
| 2:17:14| So that's probably why it would be good to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8234)|
| 2:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| Next item is 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8247)|
| 2:17:31| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| I'll defer to my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| Ms. Brooks, we're back to number 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| I know you're so excited to be up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8267)|
| 2:17:51| I will do my best to answer your questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| Because, again, this is a first time for Knox County, the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| Would it be prudent that the developer have 100% of his appropriate paperwork supplied prior to our meeting next Monday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8281)|
| 2:18:14| You all need to be completely comfortable with what is presented before you and that it gives you enough information to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8294)|
| 2:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| And it's my understanding that we do not have 100% of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8303)|
| 2:18:30| That is for this body to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| So you have a completed traffic study for this and it's already been signed off and we can now see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8312)|
| 2:18:39| I might defer to Director Snowden on the status of the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8319)|
| 2:18:44| I think that's been under debate recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| Because my question is, again, we want to have everything in our hands before we take this historic vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8327)|
| 2:18:58| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| We have or we had a completed traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| And then the developer chose to make some changes to dwelling units and commercial square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8343)|
| 2:19:10| which obviously those things, based on the numbers, have an effect on the trip generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| So he had to reengage his traffic engineer after we had reviewed and approved and agreed to his original traffic study to engage that engineer to do an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8357)|
| 2:19:28| We have not seen that complete update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| So we're not 100%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| At this point, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| So is this something that would be relevant to recommend to the developer that maybe they should consider a postponement for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8377)|
| 2:19:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| Again, if this body is not comfortable with what's presented before them, then yes, that is within your purview to request a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8396)|
| 2:20:04| But from your standpoint, that's not something you would recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| You'd say come to commission, not 100%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| If an applicant had an application that we felt like was not complete, yes, that would be a recommendation that we would make to them to consider a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8410)|
| 2:20:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| So do you consider an application complete without the traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8420)|
| 2:20:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| I think in this instance, a traffic study is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| It's important for it to be complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| But from your standpoint, you're not going to recommend to the developer that maybe he should defer for 30 days to make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8432)|
| 2:20:43| Never mind, I won't say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8443)|
| 2:20:48| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| Just quickly to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| So through Planning Commission, there were 11 conditions added to the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8454)|
| 2:21:02| I have addressed all of those conditions to the applicant and requested responses in the form of an amended or added conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8462)|
| 2:21:13| I'd like to just read those to you all so that you're aware of what I have asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8473)|
| 2:21:17| One, a completed revised traffic impact analysis inclusive of revised uses with an accompanying summary memo from Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8477)|
| 2:21:26| concurring with all assumptions and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| Two, detailed cost sharing agreement itemizing funding responsibilities of road improvements with preliminary construction cost estimate and phases of installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8489)|
| 2:21:40| Three, revised public benefits section to include detailed features of proposed amenities, use and or partnership agreements including maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8500)|
| 2:21:48| phases of implementation and funding responsibilities to please address cemetery and amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| Four, proposed HOA covenants and restrictions detailing proposed fees associated with recreational maintenance and how these will be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8514)|
| 2:22:02| Five, a sidewalk pedestrian design plan and uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| Six, signage design standards desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| Seven, revised timeline to include road and recreational details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| Eight, a reduction in paved areas on the south side design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| Nine, increased common areas and vegetative buffers on the north side design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| And ten, consideration of relocating recreational park areas out of floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| All of those come out of discussion from Planning Commission that I did not see in the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8545)|
| 2:22:31| That also gives this body your responsibility as far as fiscal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8551)|
| 2:22:37| And it would also give this body a final plat timeline, which we don't currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8557)|
| 2:22:43| I did get some preliminary responses from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| I haven't had a follow-up conversation with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8568)|
| 2:22:52| I feel like they are inadequate at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8572)|
| 2:22:57| So that's my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| Just a follow-up with Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| So because of this type development, if we don't have it in concrete, in writing, it's just hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8589)|
| 2:23:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| You want to have as much detail as possible and the commitments clearly laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8603)|
| 2:23:29| Because you will only see this once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| That's why we've got to be spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| Director Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker, on that traffic study, I'd like to add a little more clarity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| I have spoke to both the developer and the engineer performing the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| One of the reasons for the delay was TDOT was requiring them to collect traffic counts when school was back in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8630)|
| 2:23:58| Obviously, that required some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| The engineer has informed me that he will provide, hopefully to my department by the end of the week, a summary of his findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8641)|
| 2:24:11| But he doesn't think he'll have the complete study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| So just as an update, that is where we stand at present with the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8655)|
| 2:24:20| But should we, from here on out, when applicants are doing traffic studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8660)|
| 2:24:26| that we express to them that they have to be done during school times, like TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8666)|
| 2:24:34| so that they won't waste their time doing something during Christmas break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| Yeah, I think these folks, they kind of caught really both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| They started the process in the summer, so they had that constraint, and now they've got the constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8683)|
| 2:24:49| So the timing was bad there, but that was one of the reasons why this study really probably couldn't be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8689)|
| 2:24:56| In a timely fashion, it's what we would have liked or they would have liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| If they had a 30-day delay, though, the engineer could get the certified copy that you'd need, if they had 30 more days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8700)|
| 2:25:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8709)|
| 2:25:13| Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| Just some follow-up discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| I do want to state that I'm really excited and want to give kudos to the applicant for bringing this concept before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8716)|
| 2:25:25| It's something I've advocated for a long time, being more creative, mixed-use, kind of walkable, livable, age-in-place area with retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8725)|
| 2:25:34| And, you know, I told him, I said, this is kind of trial by fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| This is the first PD applicant we've had come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| And when we wrote this ordinance, we absolutely knew that we would need to tweak some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| And so, you know, kudos to them because they've just hung in there with us and they've been patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8747)|
| 2:25:54| And so some of the things we're asking for, we realize we'll need to come back in the form of maybe an amendment to the PD ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8754)|
| 2:26:03| which we are working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| And so, again, you know, I just really want to applaud them for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| I also want to remind the body that at any time the applicant can say, well, you know, I'm not going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8770)|
| 2:26:16| Now I'm going to do PR and I'm going to get three or four per unit and I'm going to develop it in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8776)|
| 2:26:24| And so you do have to look at all of your available options when you're voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8784)|
| 2:26:31| And so my ask to the applicant is really coming from a place of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8791)|
| 2:26:36| I just want to make this the absolute best project that we possibly can for our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8796)|
| 2:26:43| with the least impact on residential citizens who are already in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8803)|
| 2:26:52| And we've heard them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| If you go to the website and you look at the comments, it's 50-50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| I mean, you've got some citizens who are kind of excited about it and you've got other citizens who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| it really is about road congestion and safety and those improvements that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| Director Snowden and I have talked about needed to be done 10, 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8829)|
| 2:27:15| You know, that's why we're doing advanced NOCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| And so consider all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| So to your point, Commissioner Schoonmaker, some of the questions you're asking Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| it's up to the responsibility of this body to define those asks and those expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8845)|
| 2:27:32| The thing that we need to remember is it doesn't come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8852)|
| 2:27:37| So as you said, we need to have all of that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8857)|
| 2:27:43| available to the applicant with a reasonable amount of time for them to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| or if they feel like their responses are adequate and they want to come before the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8867)|
| 2:27:54| then it's our scope of authority to approve, deny, and that's really it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8874)|
| 2:28:04| Approve, deny, or approve with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| Approve, yeah, conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| So just keep all of that in consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8888)|
| 2:28:13| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| Excellent points by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| You know, I said earlier that plan development, plan development, this is coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8900)|
| 2:28:27| It meets the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8907)|
| 2:28:28| It meets everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| And that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| That's what we as Knox County said, that we want good growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| We don't want the sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| You know, four per acre of a regular subdivision may not look as good as sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8919)|
| 2:28:45| with the amenities and everything there, so we've got to weigh that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| We only get one shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| Like we said, we only get one shot at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| and hopefully that they will defer for 30 days so we can get this worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8933)|
| 2:28:59| to where when we make approval on it that it is done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8939)|
| 2:29:05| So the emails that I've got is mostly about traffic, traffic, traffic, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8945)|
| 2:29:14| I've got news for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8954)|
| 2:29:15| We're going to have traffic forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| You know, so, you know, Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| Give us a little update there, Jim, about Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| They're going to, the developer is responsible for improving so much of Emory Road, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8965)|
| 2:29:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| Under the original traffic study approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| I think the ADT on West Emory Road now is currently around 10,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8978)|
| 2:29:43| At full build out, I think the site close to doubled that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8983)|
| 2:29:47| so you had close to 20,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| So TDOT was requiring a consistent three-lane section through their development area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8989)|
| 2:29:56| center turn lane, wider through lanes in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=8996)|
| 2:30:00| And then the other concern that TDOT had that was a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| was a dual left turn lane off of Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| There's a single left now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| So the dual left is just the delay in the peaks was getting really problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| so they were going to have to add a dual left turn lane on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| So there were some on-site and off-site improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| While we're on the topic of West Emory infrastructure and how it relates to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9029)|
| 2:30:34| this is a perfect example of 25 or 30 years of neglect of our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9034)|
| 2:30:42| We want more developments like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| and yet we're struggling because Knox County is built on old country roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| and I know there's philosophical differences about state roads versus local roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9051)|
| 2:30:56| I think it was in August we sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| Maybe it was September, but sometime earlier this fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| I sat down with Mr. Snowden in engineering and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| tell me what it would cost right now to take West Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9065)|
| 2:31:12| widen it, turns lane, sidewalks, infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| all the way from Oak Ridge Highway to Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| We sat down and we went through that, and it was about $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| And if the resources were available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9082)|
| 2:31:26| Mr. Snowden said that his team could finish it in about six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| starting today, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| We could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| We could decide to amend our growth plan or amend our capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9096)|
| 2:31:41| We could decide to spend $8 million a year for six years, give or take a few dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9101)|
| 2:31:47| and we could improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| It's a state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| and there's a philosophical difference between we should wait for the state to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9111)|
| 2:31:54| and share in the costs versus take the lead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| and I just would argue that this is a perfect example of that if we don't start taking the lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9117)|
| 2:32:02| in our own infrastructure and if we don't start really allocating real serious resources to this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9122)|
| 2:32:09| I mean, every one of your districts has a road like this that is desperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9129)|
| 2:32:16| I mean, it is like for 30 years the doctor has said if you keep eating cheeseburgers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| you're going to have a heart attack, and we just keep eating cheeseburgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| My God, our whole county is clogged and dying quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| We've got to do something to open up the arteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| This includes Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| This includes West Emory, Tazewell, Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| I mean, we can go all the way around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| This is a perfect example of if we neglect our own infrastructure and we don't get ahead of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| we will not be able to accommodate growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| and I still argue that we ought to do more ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9165)|
| 2:32:49| and then ask the state to partner with us on the back end instead of waiting for them to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| but I know that that is not always popular and it's not always easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| but we have an amazing engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| Let's put them to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| Let's get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| That's a big primer for a long-term discussion on budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| but we could do it if we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9187)|
| 2:33:10| We just chose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| Mr. Brooks or Mr. Stodden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9199)|
| 2:33:22| when did you all first become aware that this was a project that Smithville was interested in pursuing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9202)|
| 2:33:33| Has it been years or just six months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9213)|
| 2:33:38| I mean, what kind of time frame have they been dealing with you on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9218)|
| 2:33:44| I think spring, around the springtime is when we first became aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| that they might be interested in a planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| So roughly a year, a little under a year then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9233)|
| 2:33:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| And all along the way, have they communicated with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| Have they asked about what expectations are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| What kind of dialogue has occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9248)|
| 2:34:13| I've been in and out of the discussion over the last six to eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9253)|
| 2:34:17| but, I mean, I feel like they have been communicating and sat down with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9257)|
| 2:34:23| and asked questions and reviewed the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| But, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9267)|
| 2:34:28| Director Snowden, what's been your experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| Yeah, I think they've been communicating well with my staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9270)|
| 2:34:35| as well as planning staff while Amy was away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9275)|
| 2:34:39| so I would think that it has been fairly positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9282)|
| 2:34:43| So none of this is a surprise or a shot in the dark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| or came at the county out of the blue then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| Is that just fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| Because right now it seems like we're asking them to do what we don't even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9295)|
| 2:35:00| ourselves really quite what we want them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| That's just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9304)|
| 2:35:10| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| It's me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9313)|
| 2:35:18| Kind of to their point too, Commissioner Hill, if you go through the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9318)|
| 2:35:22| it actually lists everyone that the applicant has reached out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9322)|
| 2:35:26| Part of the plan development ordinance is that it's a holistic approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9326)|
| 2:35:30| meaning they have to reach out to landscape architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| they have to reach out to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| they have to reach out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| There are lists of professionals that have to be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| in the preliminary portion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| I do want to further comment that the parks and recreational area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9347)|
| 2:35:54| has kind of been a sticking point back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| in talking with Legacy Parks and talking with Parks and Rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9358)|
| 2:36:03| with Director Mack, that this is everything that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9363)|
| 2:36:10| as far as what the county will be responsible for fiscally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| is not in any department's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| It's not in Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| It's not in Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| It is not on the Master Parks and Rec plan that will be released very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9384)|
| 2:36:33| So everything that we would be fiscally responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| would have to be in appropriation by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| So, well, the park area, the maintenance of the park area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9400)|
| 2:36:48| it has not been identified that the citizens in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9408)|
| 2:36:52| have identified this need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9412)|
| 2:36:53| There are two parks within less than two miles from the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| And so you have to look at the public benefit section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| and the requirement of the applicant to justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| and to put a weight on that public benefit to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9423)|
| 2:37:08| and to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| And right now, you have to be able to justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9430)|
| 2:37:16| the fiscal and physical responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| from the private sector to the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9440)|
| 2:37:25| So you've got to weigh out if this recreational area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9445)|
| 2:37:32| provides enough public benefit, and then if you can pay for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| and include it in your budget going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9455)|
| 2:37:39| There was an offer of a $5 per lot per home per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9459)|
| 2:37:46| That's something the law department and I are looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| because, as you all know, with covenants and restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9469)|
| 2:37:52| and an HOA, the body can then come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9472)|
| 2:37:55| and they can vote to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| And so then you get into, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9477)|
| 2:38:00| does the county actually need an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| so that we continue to collect that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9483)|
| 2:38:07| for the continued maintenance of the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| So there's just a lot of unknowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| And I've said this to the applicant and everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9493)|
| 2:38:16| I truly am not trying to be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9496)|
| 2:38:19| I'm just really trying to be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| because I don't know what we are going to be held accountable for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9501)|
| 2:38:26| as far as funding when it comes to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9506)|
| 2:38:35| Let me respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9515)|
| 2:38:39| May I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9519)|
| 2:38:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9520)|
| 2:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| Commissioner Fraser, you are right in everything you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| and I do appreciate the fact that one thing you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| a new perspective you're bringing to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| is that this situation would not be like many others, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9534)|
| 2:39:03| where we have asked for things that weren't already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9543)|
| 2:39:11| and then the burden is upon our people to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9551)|
| 2:39:16| And just as a side note, every one of us are guilty of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| We go in and we recognize a need that is not on the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9560)|
| 2:39:26| and we want it, including me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| So I do appreciate you highlighting that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9571)|
| 2:39:36| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| Let me definitely tell Commissioner Fraser, I mean, she is sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| and I agree with everything that she says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| I agree with Commissioner Schoonmaker, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| that we do have to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| I have heard from people, and I'm sure all of us have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| even though it's not our district, and I know that area well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| I grew up in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| I grew up off Emery Road, and it's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| And I've got people happy about this and people not happy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9601)|
| 2:40:06| What I have tried to tell them, like Commissioner Fraser said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| is that I would like to see this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| and I would like to be a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| to be able to say ten years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| I was a part of that commission that didn't just put up more Knox boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9617)|
| 2:40:21| Now, if you're a realtor out there, you understand a Knox box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| And I really think everybody in that area is going to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| because of the restaurants and the shops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| and the livability and the walkability and this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| However, I do think that we've got to have all of our ducks in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| So let me ask, because this would be my first time doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| I want to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| If the applicant, let me jump real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| I'm sorry, I jumped ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| The applicant had a community meeting at Carnes months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9650)|
| 2:40:55| and I was in attendance with other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| and he tried to answer every question that was put out to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| He really has been very community-oriented in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| and we've got to give credit to the developers when they do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| and so I want to give him credit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| And I do think with Mr. Snowden and Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| that he has kept them pretty well informed and apprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| And then there are also things that we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9682)|
| 2:41:25| there again kind of using my realtor hat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| that things come up and change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| and real estate and building and developing and engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| and that kind of stuff is very fluid at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| And so, you know, it's kind of hard for us to get to where we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9695)|
| 2:41:40| for our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| and the developer to kind of need to be where he needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| to make his product and make his money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9705)|
| 2:41:48| But let me say, if the applicant decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| he does not want to postpone this for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| and he comes to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| are we able at that point to put conditions on him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9716)|
| 2:42:00| that would come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9722)|
| 2:42:03| So this is just a one shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| It all has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| Can you make a motion to do the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9727)|
| 2:42:12| of some of the conditions that Commissioner Frazier has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| Are we able to do that as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| We aren't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9740)|
| 2:42:21| I mean, because I'm just thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| if he's not willing to do the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| but we want to put the conditions on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| because we feel like that's safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| then that might be an option too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| And I'm just having that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| We can do the postponement for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| We could do the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9755)|
| 2:42:36| I do know that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9756)|
| 2:42:37| So I just wanted to know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| But I just kind of wanted to put my opinion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| I think Belltown is a concept that Knox County needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9762)|
| 2:42:45| I think we're going to have more developments like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| and we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| So I'm really excited about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| but I understand traffic and I understand concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| But I don't want 1,200 more houses of Knox boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| It looks like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| this park that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| has Knox County accepted a park already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| Is it in the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| We do not have to accept a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9794)|
| 2:43:17| There's no cost if we don't accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| No, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9801)|
| 2:43:22| We have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9802)|
| 2:43:23| And the process is that it would be an agreement with Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9803)|
| 2:43:29| and then they would deed it over to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9809)|
| 2:43:33| and we would then be responsible for the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9813)|
| 2:43:37| and possible installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| But we don't have to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| That would be left up to HOA to take care of at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9823)|
| 2:43:48| And it is concerning because on all of the promotional material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| as well as the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| it's stated repeatedly that the most prominent feature of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| will be the expansive public park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9839)|
| 2:44:04| And so I struggle with that because I don't have a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9844)|
| 2:44:11| And I can't make that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| because I don't know financially what I'm going to be responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9853)|
| 2:44:16| when I've got our parks and rec director saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9856)|
| 2:44:19| it's not on our master parks plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9859)|
| 2:44:22| It hasn't been identified by the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9862)|
| 2:44:27| Looks like Dwight wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| One row down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9869)|
| 2:44:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| We have met with the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| and we have expressed a couple concerns to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9877)|
| 2:44:41| To begin with, we have not accepted or committed anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| So let me go ahead and stipulate that right up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| Two, one of the concerns we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| and I understand and will credit them with acting in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| but the marketing materials suggest various uses for this space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9893)|
| 2:44:58| which Director Mack and Ms. Benedict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| who's been extensively involved in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| clearly do not think are supported by the fact that the vast majority of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9904)|
| 2:45:08| is in a floodplain and is not buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| That doesn't mean it can't have some recreational use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| and Commissioner Lee's district, we have Collier's Preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| which is a similar property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| It's a very passive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9918)|
| 2:45:19| It's walking trails and very limited improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9919)|
| 2:45:23| So when the property does flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| the county doesn't suffer any property loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| But our concern is marketing materials for Belltown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| that show kids playing ball or outdoor pavilions or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| Obviously, these are just artist renderings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| suggestions of what might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| but they do create expectations on the part of potential buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9938)|
| 2:45:43| that ultimately, if we accept the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9943)|
| 2:45:46| we would be the party that disappoints them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| So as the project moves forward, we want to have a clear understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| I think that may be what Commissioner Frazier is speaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| as to what is viable on that portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9955)|
| 2:45:58| that they propose to convey to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| So I hope that helps answer any questions I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9961)|
| 2:46:04| Obviously, Director Mack's gone home for the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9964)|
| 2:46:07| but I'll do the best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| Well, we do not have to accept that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| Will that come before county commission to be accepted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| or can the mayor accept that land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9980)|
| 2:46:21| I'm on the board of Legacy Park, so I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9981)|
| 2:46:24| It is simply a donation of land to Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9984)|
| 2:46:28| as part of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9988)|
| 2:46:32| In normal circumstances, or any other circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9992)|
| 2:46:36| Legacy Park may accept a piece of land in the hopes that one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=9996)|
| 2:46:40| it may become a park or be conveyed over to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10000)|
| 2:46:44| Sometimes they'll do it for preservation's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10004)|
| 2:46:47| But they could still donate the land to Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10007)|
| 2:46:51| and it could just be held forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| But until Legacy Parks then sat down and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10013)|
| 2:46:56| hey, county, do you want this now, nothing would happen with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| and the county could decide, take it or not take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10020)|
| 2:47:04| or, you know, great, you got it at Legacy Parks, we don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10024)|
| 2:47:08| So it really is just a donation of land to Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10028)|
| 2:47:11| as an independent 501c3 organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| And that is the model, Commissioner Daly, Commissioner Jays, Greg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| that's the model that was used with Collier Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| The property went through Legacy Parks prior to it coming to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10042)|
| 2:47:27| And I can tell you, of all the projects we have in Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| this is mentioned, but it's so far down the priority list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10050)|
| 2:47:34| of things we would need to fundraise for or put as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10054)|
| 2:47:38| I mean, it's not on the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10058)|
| 2:47:40| It's on the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| We're always willing to accept land donations in hopes of preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10062)|
| 2:47:46| and green space and potential parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| but it's not anything that we're eminently looking at to fundraise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| or to turn into a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| Because usually Legacy Parks accepts a piece of land like Collier Preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10074)|
| 2:47:57| to go out and privately raises money, improves the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| raises that private money, improves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| and then convenes it over to the county, you know, to continue its legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| So it's just not anywhere on our radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| Well, the developer is out there marketing the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| And if this commission or the next commission does not accept that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| the developers can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| well, it was county commission that didn't take the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| We wanted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| We gave it to them, but they didn't want it, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| I think we have to look at it like Kim says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10109)|
| 2:48:32| We've got to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10112)|
| 2:48:34| What would it cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10114)|
| 2:48:37| And with two or three parks being close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| I don't know if I would accept another park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| I mean, someplace we've got to stop, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| Well, and again, Director Mack would tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| while we appreciate the availability of space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| to Mr. Jay's point, it might be good to land bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| for the sake of preservation on Legacy Parks' part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| but it doesn't necessarily represent suitable land for park development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10140)|
| 2:49:04| In every case, it doesn't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10144)|
| 2:49:07| it may not be consistent with what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| We have limited bandwidth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10149)|
| 2:49:11| There's only so much park space that we're equipped to staff and maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10151)|
| 2:49:15| And so you might say, you know, we have 1,000 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10155)|
| 2:49:18| We'll give you a perfect flat land to make a great big athletic complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10158)|
| 2:49:22| Well, we're going to be back before this body saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| we simply don't have the capacity to take that on at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10165)|
| 2:49:28| and we'd need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| So we did share our concerns with the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230117?start=10170)|
