| 0:00:00| All right, I'd like to go ahead and call this city of Knoxville to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=0)|
| 0:00:29| And we'll start with the invocation by Councilman Brown and the pledge by Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=29)|
| 0:00:39| Everybody would stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=39)|

| 0:00:43| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=43)|

| 0:01:03| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=66)|
| 0:01:11| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=75)|
| 0:01:22| Wilson, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=86)|

| 0:01:30| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| We have a quorum, and we're going to jump right into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=104)|
| 0:01:52| Mr. Payne, I assume everybody has a copy of this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| I thought what we would do tonight is you know, obviously at the last meeting we took the straw poll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=124)|
| 0:02:20| and it came out the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| And so Mr. Paynington has outlined specifics to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| And I thought if we could go through, Mr. Paynington and I spoke earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| and perhaps we were off target and we could be off target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| but identified some of the issues that I think that we could perhaps put to bed quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| and then obviously there's going to be some issues, you know, with certain bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| So if we could, I'd like to go down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| And what I'll do is have Mr. Paynington just kind of give a very brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| And then if we need further discussion, then we can go down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| And if not, then we can agree and start to whittle this plan down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| and get it to where, you know, we can finally have a final document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| to where we could bring to, I guess, Mr. Gilbert, I would assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| is going to draft this and move this process along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| So if we can, you know, keep the conversation to the plan itself this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| I think it will benefit us all and get us a lot closer to where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| We don't have another meeting scheduled as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| and perhaps we might be able to get something firm tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| And if not, we'll keep working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| But let's keep that the goal this evening, if we could, to walk out of here with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| So with that, Mr. Paynington, I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Again, it's a pleasure to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| I always love coming to Knoxville, and it's a pleasure to work with the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| We were talking before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| and just really what a pleasure it's been to work with everybody through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| I know it's been difficult, but I think the council, the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| and the employees, everybody has worked to make a lot of progress, get us to a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| Tonight, what I hope to do and hope to help you do is look at some of these major issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| what I've called the levers impacting the DBDC-MAX plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| and to the extent that the council can agree sort of on these big-picture items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| then I think it would be sufficient to pass off for the attorneys to work on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| At this point, Vice Mayor, do you want me to just take one item at a time, or how would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| I mean, we started it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| We thought the first two would probably render some discussion, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| So if you want to start at number three, we'll see how our assumptions were about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Item number three is the interest crediting rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| I've assumed for purpose of the proposal and for everything up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| that the defined contribution accounts would be credited at the rate of return of the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| which I presume would be around six and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| Of course, that's not a guaranteed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| So to the extent the council is comfortable with that assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| or you want to have discussion on that, I think now would be the time for that particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=318)|
| 0:05:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| You're going to have to enlarge on that just a little bit for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| Why would the rate of return, why would we have to have an assumed rate of return on the defined contribution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| You're talking about the defined contribution portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| For purposes of costing the plan, I had to make some assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| But the rate is going to be whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| I mean, it is, but to some degree, if you're making $40,000 a year and the rate is five percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| the DB plan kicks in and so then there's a cost associated with the DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| I mean, six and a half or eight percent might not make any difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| but depending on what your salary level is, at some point, the defined benefit component would kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| And so for purposes of my projections, I had to make some assumption about future returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=366)|
| 0:06:15| So we're not going to segregate these funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| They're going to be commingled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Well, there's going to be one bucket of assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| To the extent that the defined benefit plan is the larger plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| then your retirement benefit was going to be based on that two percent per year, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| two percent of pay times years of service limited to $40,000 or whatever is determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Or if the account balance, you know, results in a larger benefit, your benefit is based on that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| So it's one bucket of assets, and then those assets will be used to provide an annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| It will just be a matter of whether the annuity ends up being based on the DB benefit or the DC benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| But it is just one bucket, even though there will be different accounting as we account for these individual accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=416)|
| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Councilman Delbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| You picked six and a half percent, which is more conservative than the seven and three-eighths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| but less conservative than the, what did we experience, 5.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| I mean, where does the number come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Just a midpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| How did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| For purposes of the projections and of the forecast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| my assumption is that the pension board would be relatively more conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| than they are on the current investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Currently, as you know, we're at seven and three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Whether or not the long-term investment policy drives a five percent return or a six percent return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| I mean, six and a half seem to be a relatively reasonable amount to start with in terms of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| how much is this plan going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Let's do some projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| At the end of the day, for many people, whether the return is six percent or seven percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| they're going to get their account balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| So you plug the number in so that you can analyze how it works out through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Yeah, the six and a half percent is not part of the plan document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| I mean, that's just an assumption I made for costing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| So that you can run costing out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Yeah, I apologize if I gave the misimpression that I was saying let's adopt six and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| It would work as well if you used 5.68 or whatever the 10-year average was, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| It's just a number you plug in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| What is the tendency as you either go down or up, which plan changes the most?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| I mean, does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Well, I mean, as the interest rate goes down, the DB plan is more likely to come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| particularly for lower paid employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| Councilman Grieve, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| I just didn't know if you had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Your body language tells me you might have had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Maybe I'm assuming something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| I like your lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Don't encourage him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Am I glowing or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| I'll keep moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| The light's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| I'll keep moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| So, I mean, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| I didn't turn mine on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Do you want to just say, okay, we have a consensus on these items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| How do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| We can vote them if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| I'm glad to do a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| You know, if we want to do a vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| That six and a half percent is just an assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| The six and a half, right, is just a number I was using for my projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| That's not part of the document that I'm asking you to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=574)|
| 0:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| His light is fully realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| Vice Mayor, the mayor just said that maybe I should clarify what I'm asking you to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| is to accept that the rate of return credited on the fund is whatever the fund earns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| So if the fund earns four percent, then there's a four percent credit to people's accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| That's what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| What it's going to be is what it realistically is going to be every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| You're just using that as an assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| So my light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| I knew it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Councilman Wallace, are you comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| I'm just making sure you're comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| I'm comfortable with the protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| I mean, you're going to go to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| It's not going to be quite so easy or may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| So I just, yeah, I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| I just don't know how you're going to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| I'm just going to assume because there's no dissent that we accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| Well, I mean, I'm personally, I think it's too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| I mean, the ten-year rate of return is 5.2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Why are we adopting a plan based on 6.5 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| At this point, the plan itself, we're just saying whatever the rate of return is, is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| Now, the costing numbers is a totally different discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| but this is just talking about the plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| So it's not 6.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| I mean, it's just whatever the rate of return is in the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| But we're being told this plan costs so much based on 6.5 percent, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| I mean, there's two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| One question is, what does the plan cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| The other question is, how does the plan operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| And what I was trying to address in these is how does the plan operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| The whole question of what does the plan cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| then you've got to make all sorts of assumptions about turnover, retirement, future investment return, la, la, la, la, la.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| But this is just saying how, you know, if we're going to use this plan, how does it operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| So forget the 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| He used that as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| That's not what you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| The voting is whether the interest crediting rate will be assumed to be the rate of return earned by the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| the actual rate of return earned by the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| No numbers are associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| It's whatever it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Well, I mean, I'd certainly agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| But in terms of costing the plan, I mean, let's just think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| This is what we're being told of how much this plan is going to cost based on this 6.5 percent number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| And the 10-year rate of return is 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| No, that's a different number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| I've said the 10-year rate of return for our current assets is 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| So we are adopting this plan based upon 6.5, a whole more than a point greater than our 10-year rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=744)|
| 0:12:34| I think that's a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| That's another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Mr. Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| In order to try to expedite this, I mean, if you even did a quick show of hands and we had a majority and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| okay, this one's done, let's move on, I mean, I don't know how you guys want to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| What are we opposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Item three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Can we move on to item four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| The retirement age had been suggested to be age 62 for the general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| age 55 and 25 years for the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| The only additional proviso that I put on that, I said if there's going to be a 10-year vesting schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| which has been suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| that perhaps it makes sense that the normal retirement age should be 62 and 10 years of service in general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| so you don't automatically vest just because you get to be age 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| And in the fire and police, it would also be a maximum retirement age not to exceed 62 and 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=816)|
| 0:13:44| So if you happen to be in the fire and police and you quit and you didn't have 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| then you could still get a retirement benefit at 62 and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Now, that's not going to affect a whole lot of people in the fire and police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| because most of them are hired relatively young just because of the way the careers run in the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| But just for simplicity and consistency's sake, my recommendation on that was 62 and 10 for the general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=842)|
| 0:14:10| 55 and 25 on the fire and police, but not after 62 and 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| So before I guess I ask if you agree or disagree, is there any clarification that you would like to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| No clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| But originally you wrote this plan out and proposed 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| I just wonder why you changed it to 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| That was instructed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| I mean, if that's not acceptable and, you know, the first numbers I costed were 65 and 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=878)|
| 0:14:47| Fifty-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Fifty-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Sixty-five and 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| And then we came back and said, well, if we change this, how much does it change the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| And so the most recent numbers that I generated were at the 62 and 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| That's, you know, obviously if the ages are older, then the cost is a bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| If the age is younger, it's a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| But it's still, you know, either way, I still think it's within that seven, eight percent of pay long term, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| my impression was that's kind of what we were shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| Councilman Dalvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| On the I was I put my light on for the retirement age part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| So let me go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| I understood you saying 55 and 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| That's kind of what we do now, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Rule of 75 or at least as close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| What's the not later than 62 and 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| In other words, you can't put money in the retirement system after age 62?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Let's say that you're in the fire and police and you're in the unusual position of having been hired at a later age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| So you're hired at 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| And then you work until age 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Well, that's 15 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Under the initial provisions of 55 and 25, you're still not eligible for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| You're not eligible for a retirement benefit until the date you would have gotten 25 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| The 62 and 10 is an additional cap that says, okay, well, if you're 62 and 10 years of service in fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=970)|
| 0:16:19| and police, then you could go ahead and take a retirement benefit at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| But it would be a lesser benefit because you haven't put in as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| Yes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| We don't have anything like Social Security that if you take an early retirement, you get reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Like age 66, if you opt in at 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| There's not a coordination with Social Security in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1004)|
| 0:16:52| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| You kind of flickered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| I'll just throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| I'll propose 65 and 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Beat on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| That's what he originally proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| I don't really have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| I think 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| You're saying 65 general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| 65 general government and 57 fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| That's just my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| That's what he had originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| I kind of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| I don't see anything wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| That's a little higher than what some of our other competing cities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| But throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| Beat it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| I could address that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| In terms of the change that folks asked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| The change came after discussions with the employee groups and all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| It was part of their coming to an agreement to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Also, I might add on relative to the 62, it's a substantial change without the rule of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| As you will note at the various agendas that come up when retirees come right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| substantial numbers of people are retiring in general government well under 62 with the rule of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| And this prevents any full retirement until 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| So that was the thinking behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| And in working with the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| I just make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| It's not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| I have looked at this and given a lot of thought about the 65-57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| And I think back to the gentleman who was here last week, and he works in, I think, public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1109)|
| 0:18:38| And it's a fairly physical, labor-intensive position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| And he's not certainly at the high end of the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| As a matter of fact, he conceivably could be making $392.30 a week when he retires based on some of these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| So I'm thinking that there is a cost involved with some employees going to 65 in order to be eligible for retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1133)|
| 0:19:06| The cost being that physically some of the jobs are much more demanding than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| And so we can't have physically demanding and, you know, not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| But it concerns me that we could have people who might not be in the best of health, as they are in some of these jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1156)|
| 0:19:25| and that we would have an increased number of accidents, illnesses, disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| that would offset any savings that might appear to be the case in this three-year age difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| So that being a serious consideration to me, that we do not, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| the accidents that we've had have been in public service and the most serious injuries over the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1184)|
| 0:19:55| Is that correct, Dr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| I believe the most serious recent accidents have been in public service, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| And a lot of those jobs, you know, are just really, really extremely physically demanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| And as a carpenter, 65 and going on a roof-to-nail or whatever, I'm just real concerned that 62 would be a reasonable age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1209)|
| 0:20:19| There would be nothing to prevent someone who chose from working longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| So if I was in reasonably good health and I wanted to work a little longer, I could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| But if I was not or I was just tired, I could leave at 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| If I could make one other comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| In the general government, the change, as Dr. Lyons indicated, from rule of eight at 62 is a very substantial cost change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| 62 is also much more representative of what an average retirement age is within general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1253)|
| 0:21:00| Within the fire and police, the change from 50 to 55 is also relatively substantial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| particularly combined with the change in the basic multiplier, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| So, you know, 55 and 62 I think is a little more consistent with industry standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| but I certainly leave it to your discretion to do what you feel appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| I would certainly be more comfortable at the 55 and 62 range in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| Now, what is the current retirement age, Dr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| It is right now for general government it is 62 with the rule of 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| which means if somebody starts at 20, they're retiring at 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| So that's, you know, with 12 more years of retirement or could retire at 50 and 55 for police or fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1308)|
| 0:21:57| Excuse me, 50 for fire and police right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| That's fairly substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| So, you know, where do we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| Do we want to vote on the recommendation or do we want further discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| Why don't we just go through all the items and then we can come back maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| We're slowing it down, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| I'd be more comfortable if we settled one before we went to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| because as I've watched us discuss some other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| we can really get into the weeds in a hurry and then forget where the path was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| And so from my perspective, Councilman Grieve, you look stunned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1348)|
| 0:22:36| Again, I would just be more comfortable if we had one thing settled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| but that's part of my orderly learning style that we talked about in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| With all due respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| No, part of my problem with going item by item is that, as you know, I did not vote for this plan to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1371)|
| 0:22:59| And so now we're talking about voting one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| What I would prefer, because I may end up voting with you, Council Lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| but I want to know what all the pieces are instead of just doing it a piece at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| In other words, there may be some pieces in here that may put me over on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| And, by the way, I do want to say I want to thank Dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| and I want to thank Alan for answering my questions, which I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| That was a great help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| It really did help me with the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| But I'm having, Vice Mayor, I'm having a little bit of a problem just sitting here kind of voting on one thing at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| when I'm not sure what the overall plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| Well, I guess my response to that, these are straw polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| I mean, these are not binding polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| But we're going to sit here from now until Christmas if we don't start getting some things down on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| And, I mean, we've had numerous workshops, and we could have numerous more workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| But if we don't, you know, so we talk about every item and then come back and vote how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| What do we do after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| I mean, that's my whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| Just like what Councilman Delavauke said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| It's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| Well, I mean, I just think that we need to start trimming the items down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| I mean, we decided at the last meeting that we're going with the, you know, the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| The straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| But these are issues, and if the end of it, and if it doesn't look right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| and if the council wants to go another way, we'll go another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| But we've got to get to the point to where we know what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| And we're not going to do, you know, we'll just continue to discuss and discuss and discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| And, I mean, I'd like to see it get to the point to where, you know, we've got something, uncle, firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1473)|
| 0:24:42| If you just take each of those groups separately, we can say the age and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| Take the general government and then take the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| and let's put the numbers out there and see what we vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Well, I mean, in other words, the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| We'll vote the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Either up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| And we can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| I mean, if there's something that, as Councilman Wallace pointed out, but we've got to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| My like is 57, and I was thinking maybe I like Brenda's 62, so I'm kind of where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Then we need to vote on them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| Hence my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1528)|

| 0:26:35| I didn't know we could throw in a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Well, the way I presented it, we were going to vote each plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| We were going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1597)|

| 0:27:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| We'll go again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| We'll do it one more time on 62 only, and then we'll come back to the Wallace amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1638)|

| 0:27:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| Councilman Dela Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1649)|

| 0:27:37| Councilman Pavlis. Yes. Councilman Saunders. No. Councilman Steyer. Yes. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1657)|
| 0:27:47| No. Councilman Brown. Aye. Four ayes, four noes, and a pass. Okay, so it would fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1667)|
| 0:28:03| If I'm right, Mr. Swanson. Oh, geez. You have counsel here. We're going to be here forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1683)|
| 0:28:13| He always taught me that. I just wanted to call on him. All right, so now we'll go back to the 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1693)|
| 0:28:21| Councilman Della Vopi. No. Councilman Grieve. Yes. Councilman Palmer. No. Councilman Pavlis. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1701)|

| 0:28:46| Councilman Brown. No. Councilman Campin. Yes. Well, here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1726)|
| 0:28:59| Does this mean that general government employees can never retire? They're here forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1739)|
| 0:29:08| Well, what about if we found a number in between there? 63. All right, we're going to go with the suggestion of 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1748)|
| 0:29:19| Councilman Grieve. You're on roll call every time. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1759)|
| 0:29:28| Councilman Palmer. Yes. Councilman Pavlis. Yes. Councilman Saunders. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1768)|
| 0:29:38| Councilman Steyer. No. Councilman Wallace. I'm going to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1778)|
| 0:29:49| Councilman Brown. I'm going to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| Councilman Campin. Yes. Councilman Della Vopi. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| That was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1800)|
| 0:30:08| Vice Mayor, pardon me. You had voted on the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| There was not a discussion specifically if the 10-year service requirement was acceptable or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| so I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| I see Mr. Saunders shaking his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| Is everybody okay with the 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| Yes. Isn't that the vesting years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Well, there's two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| There's two different issues because right now there's a five-year vesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| but you can retire at age 62 even if you don't have five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| So I was suggesting that those two be connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| So it would be 60-whatever, 63 and 10 in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| But I just wanted to have that point of clarification before we moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| If you have only nine years, you can't retire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Under this, well, if you make it 10, then you wouldn't have 10, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| then nine wouldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| If you have less than 10 years, you get a refund of employee contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| Councilman Saunders, I'm anticipating a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| I was just going to make an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| As we go through all this, we may design a camel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| That kind of concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| A three-hump camel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| And then for the fire and police, won't you go ahead and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Right now the initial proposal is age 55 with 25 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1879)|
| 0:31:27| But if they do not meet that requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| then they could go out under the age 62 and 10-year requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| So it's whichever one of those gets them there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| Currently it's age 50 with 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| So that would be the initial recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| And the Wallace Amendment is 57, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| And the Wallace Amendment is 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| I propose 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| But the recommendation that you brought forward is 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| That was the initial recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| 55 and 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| This is on 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Well, can I say this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| It's what he's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| But I originally went back on March 31st, seems like eons ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| You know, that was, we talked about 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| You know, with 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| So that's how I got to 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| And I think that's, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| But anyway, that's really what I'm going off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| That's kind of what we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| And I'm just back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| That's how it came out, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| So we're talking about two here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| We're talking about two numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| We're talking about 55 and 57, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Councilman Wallace, is that what you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| So do we want to vote 56 or do we want to go through the exercise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| I mean, seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| I mean, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| If we could raise hands, it would be faster for God's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| It just seems like, I mean, the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| I mean, you have your five that supported the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| And then out of those five, if somebody wants to make amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| that seems like that would be the easier way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| I mean, we're all in it together, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| I mean, the five is nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| I mean, we've all got to come together on what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| So we're trying to do what's fair and best, you know, for overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Why don't we go with 56?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| And if that doesn't fly, we can go up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| 56 it is then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Councilman Huffman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| I was holding out for 57, but I guess we're at yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| So we're done, because you're already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Yeah, you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Already got five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| I thought it was 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| I mean, is that a yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| We already had five, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| I just thought people might want to go on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| Vice Mayor, it's the recommendation with the one change of using 56| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| instead of 55 on the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| May I continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| The contribution credits, which is sort of the driving force for the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| and the accumulator and so forth, had been set at 8% contribution for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| general government, 10% for fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| with the assumption the employees will be contributing 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| Although I did not put the employee contribution as a discussion point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| anywhere in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| If you wanted to include that, this would probably be the place to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| But the 6% would be employee contribution, 8% general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| 10% fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| I approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2148)|
| 0:35:58| Are there concerns with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Well, I'm concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I'll approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| I think it's a very rich plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| There's some disagreement with that, but I think this is a very rich plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| And just for the record, I mean, I just sort of want to explain my thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| I mean, this is a plan that, I mean, I think it's pretty clear that I'm not for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| And I don't plan on voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| So I don't want to get down to the nuts and bolts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| I mean, I think it should be up to the people that are planning on supporting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| to figure out what their plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| So that's why I'm doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I'm not trying to impede or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| But that's where I am on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| That's why I'm, you know, I don't want to push you guys to change your plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| and then I not vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| I just didn't think that would be respectful to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| So, in a way, I'm trying to be respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| I mean, you have your five, at least your five that are supporting this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| and perhaps others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| But, I mean, I just don't plan on supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| So I don't want to, you know, lead you all to believe that I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| negotiating on all these different numbers, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| Well, you know, you threw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| I think it makes a little bit of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| But I think, like Councilman Wallace said, I mean, this, I mean, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| I hate we're getting hung up on five fours or five whatevers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| I mean, we voted, you know, with the straw poll to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| And I guess my hope, just as a city member of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| that we would have continued to have dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| But we've got to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| And, you know, I understand if somebody doesn't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| But, I mean, it's still open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| I wouldn't discount everything that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| I mean, that's what we're doing is crafting what the majority of the members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| and I would, it would just be my hope that we'd all contribute towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Councilman Dela Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| I don't have a problem with these contribution credits, the 8% and the 10% in a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| because that kind of makes the pot healthy in terms of making retirement possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2292)|
| 0:38:20| I guess my question is, if we're in a combined plan with defined benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| and defined contribution, either blended or at least option of picking the highest one at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| I kind of wonder if the employees shouldn't be given, like, 6.5% or something slightly higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| to the extent they're going for a defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| But that being said, if that's the majority view, then we'll go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| I just think for a defined contribution plan, 8% and 10% seems fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| And I don't have a problem with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2329)|
| 0:38:57| So let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| I mean, I think we've started down a path, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| I mean, I'm seeing a lot of shaking heads, but I think we should still vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| Mr. Vice Mayor, can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| I understand where Marshall is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| I'm not comfortable with this, but I do agree with Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| We have to come with something, because at the end of the day, whatever we put on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| we need to do all we can to make sure that that is passed by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| If it's not exactly what I want or what anybody else wants, I'll understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| But it's so important that we make some adjustments here as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| Now, will these be the final adjustments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Maybe in some years we'll come back and visit this issue again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| I don't exactly know where this is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| And that's the reason, even with discomfort, I will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| And I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| I think that's what my hopes for the process would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| And we're not, you know, we've still got plenty of opportunity to discuss the numbers and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| but we've got to, you know, this was the chosen plan by the majority of members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| So, Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Yes, if we go to 6.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| I need more of a no, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| It's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| I know we've been here about 40 minutes and we were hoping to get through most of these tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| I was trying to skip around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| And now I'm thinking maybe I better just dig right through and go on 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| No, let's do as we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Number seven, the drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| The drop, yeah, we'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| The drop is being taken out of the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| We do not have a drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| One of the desirable characteristics of the drop is to get a portion of your benefit as a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| So I put a recommendation in that under the new plan that a member eligible for retirement could elect to receive either 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2492)|
| 0:41:42| or 10% of the value of their benefit as a lump sum option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| This is not an additional cost measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| This is simply to provide members with an opportunity to get a portion of their benefit as a lump sum, which does two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| Number one, it gives them the opportunity to take a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| To the extent they do, it actually moves some of that risk back to the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| How does it do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| How does it move the risk back to the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| You figure out the 5% or 10% that would ordinarily grow over the 20 or 30 years of retirement out of the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2532)|
| 0:42:20| So let's say assets to grow to pay that annual payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| How does it lessen the risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Let's say somebody had $200,000 at retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| I'm just making numbers up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| And let's say they decide to take 10% of that as a lump sum, $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| Well, if their monthly benefit would have been $20,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| now it's going to be $18,000 because they took 20% of it as a lump sum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| which means now the city is only responsible for managing the assets associated with the $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| So $180,000 now goes into that risk pool, not $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| This creates a relatively smaller risk pool of assets for the retired population to the extent members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| And that works even if they opt for the defined benefit portion of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| Well, they're not going to opt for the defined benefit or defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| I mean, one of them is going to provide a larger annual or monthly benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| Whichever one provides the larger monthly benefit, that's going to be the basis for their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| But then once that is determined, then I can figure out, well, what's the value of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| Is it the account balance or if it's DB, what's the value of the DB benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| And I'm just saying, if you elect a member, have a portion of that, 5% or 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| which I consider to be relatively small of their total benefit, that it's a benefit to the member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| It doesn't have additional cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| And it somewhat reduces the total amount of risk to the city once the person retires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Because their benefit level drops down based on the amount that's in the pot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| But, you know, if you had over a series of years, you had $500 million worth of people retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| and everybody elected to take a 10% lump sum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| then at the end of that period you've got $450 million worth of assets to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| and worth of risk to have instead of having $500 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| So it just reduces the asset pool, which by default reduces the risk pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| And is there an employee demand for a lump sum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Is that why you get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| I mean, how do you start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| How do you get to this option as opposed to just leaving it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| It is very, very desirable for most employees to receive some portion of their benefit as a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| That's part of the reason the drop plan has been desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| It's part of the reason people like participating in G1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| because the G1 account balance is available as a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| In the DBDCmax, the DC account is not available as a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| I mean, this is, you know, the idea is to convert that to an annuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| and provide a guaranteed lifetime benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| So I was just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| This is the trip to Tahiti or the remodel of the kitchen, as you would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| I mean, if this is not, you know, if this doesn't seem desirable to the council, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| I was just offering it up as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| I was trying to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| I like the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| I propose 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Hearing no other, we'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| It's up to 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| I was suggesting it could be 5 percent or 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| I mean, if you want to just limit it to 10 percent, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| but I just wanted to clarify what the recommendation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Up to 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| An option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Yeah, it's just an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| It's cost neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| And I can see it being a real benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Somebody would like to have early cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Up to 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Cost neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| Ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2750)|

| 0:45:59| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2763)|

| 0:46:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Looky there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| How easy that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| Let's do that one again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Yeah, let's do that one again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| That's the whole process tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| We ready to move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| We're going to skip the in line of duty for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| We'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Let's look at number nine, early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Again, this is not meant to be a significant cost item either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| This is more of a practical matter of how we're going to handle early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Under the current plan for general government, somebody with 25 years is probably looking at the rule of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| Not at early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| But previously, if you had 25 years, you could take early retirement in general government, fire, and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| I'm just suggesting in the new plan, if somebody works 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| it might be reasonable to allow them to take an early retirement benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| The 4% per year reduction I'm recommending isn't exactly actuarial equivalent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| but it's close to being cost neutral and it's just easy to understand, easy to administer, so forth and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2836)|
| 0:47:23| so that anybody that worked to on or after age 50 that had at least 20 years of service under this recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| could elect to take an early retirement benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2851)|
| 0:47:39| As you get to 50, why that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| Under the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| It's pretty young to me, but that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Yeah, it is pretty young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| If somebody works 20 years from age 30 to 50, they're not going to have near substantial value in their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| They're still going to have a 4% per year reduction for general government for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| So you're talking about a 48% reduction in their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| And yet, if somebody wants to take $5,000 a year at 50 rather than $10,000 a year at 62,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2884)|
| 0:48:12| that's not a significant cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| It's just more of a, you know, it's more common to allow early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| Now, if you want to put early retirement at 55 and 20 for general government and 50 and 20 for fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| and police, you know, I was just trying to suggest something reasonable to start out with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| If not, Ms. Wilson, call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Councilman Stayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| I'm going to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| I voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| No, but I'll take a higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| No, with a higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| So that would pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| That passed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Yes, it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Item 10, termination prior to normal retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| This provision is very similar to how the current plan works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| If somebody terminates employment prior to being eligible for retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| they can currently take a refund of employee contributions with interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| and then they would forfeit any future benefit in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| I'm suggesting that the same type provision apply in the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| Somebody could say, I have ten years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| I'm vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| I should be able to get, you know, the value of my employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| and employer contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| Well, if you put that provision in, that's an additional cost to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| and that's not consistent with the current plan operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| So I'm just going to think this point was significant enough that I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| to give the opportunity to consider it, understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| But the recommendation is that it work the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Unless you're eligible for retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| your only option is either to defer your benefit to the point you are eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| to retirement or take a refund of employee contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| and forfeit any future potential benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Councilman Delfo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| This is the word normal retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| but really you could you'd have to read in there early retirement under item nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| that you just said was 50, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| If they were not eligible for early retirement when they terminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| then they're not going to age into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| The early retirement is you have to be age 50 when you terminate and have 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| Once you're 50, you can take out your share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| and the government's share of the funds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Once you're eligible for early retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| then you can take a monthly early retirement pension, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| So normal retirement doesn't mean the 62 and the 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| It means or early retirement if you qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| I mean, I guess I can clarify the recommendation and say prior to being eligible for retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| if that's more acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Councilman Dela Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| Item number 11, I'm just suggesting that the current optional forms in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| with the exception of the drop benefit, of course, the current optional forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| such as the joint survivor, with or without pop-up, certain in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| that we just use the same optional forms in the new plan as the old plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| Again, this isn't a cost item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| This is just more for administrative purposes to make sure everybody's on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| It just lets you separate whether you want to take it all as the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| or split it with the survivor if you die first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| It's a pre-decease clause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Part of it's a joint survivor, which you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| There's also a certain in life benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| So if you took a certain in life and died within ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| then your beneficiary would get the remainder of the ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| There's a cash refund option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| So if you elected the cash refund option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| and died before you received the value of your benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| then the remaining value of that benefit would go to your beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| But it's the same optional forms that are currently available in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| In other words, you agree to take less because you want to have a survivor benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| You know, my only problem is what are all the optional forms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| I don't even know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| What are all the optional forms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| The all optional forms would be, for example, 50% joint survivor, 100% joint survivor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| 75% joint survivor with or without a pop-up feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| The pop-up being that if you elect 100% joint survivor with a pop-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| and your spouse dies, then your benefit moves back up to the life annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| But it's cost neutral, is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| Yes, it's cost neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| This is just more administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| I just want to make sure everybody is okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3254)|

| 0:54:34| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| Item number 12, normal form of benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| Currently, in the general government, when you retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| your benefit is defined to be a life annuity for the remainder of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| You can elect an optional form, as we were just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| Currently, in the fire and police, if you're married,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| the normal form is a 50% joint survivor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| So if you elect a different optional form, it's based on the 50% joint survivor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| which is a relatively more beneficial benefit form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Under the new plan, the recommendation is that it would be a life annuity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| both in the general government and the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| So that 50% joint survivor subsidy in the fire and police would no longer exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| in the new plan under this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| What was the 57%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| So right now it's 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| but what you're saying is that the survivor will get the full amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| Let's say that you retired in fire and police today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| and your benefit was $20,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| And you said, okay, I'm going to elect $20,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| Five years later, you pass away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| That form of benefit, the normal form without making any other election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| provides 50% of that, $10,000 a year, for the rest of your spouse's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| Now, you can elect a 50% joint survivor in general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| but there's a reduction to your benefit in the general government to make that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| In the fire and police, currently there is no reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| In fact, if you want a life annuity in the fire and police and you're married,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| you can elect a larger benefit than what the benefit formula would otherwise supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| So it's an additional subsidy that's built on to the current fire and police benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| You're doing away with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| So what you do is you elect a 50%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| You get a life annuity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| You get a life annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| Or you can still elect a different optional form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| It's just a lower amount under this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| So if you take the 50% or the 70%, you get less than the full benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| You get less than the $20,000 a year in my example, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| You might get $18,000 a year or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=3407)|

| 1:07:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| As I tell you that the recommendation is $40,000, if you didn't have a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| I would turn you to either the valuation report or the e-mail I sent around earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4080)|
| 1:08:09| The average pay in general government is, this was as of the 2011 valuation report, so it's a year old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4089)|
| 1:08:17| But at that time, the average pay was $42,800, almost $43,000 in general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| and about almost $47,000 in the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| So the total average in the city for all general government fire and police employees is $44,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4107)|
| 1:08:36| So the $40,000, I think, is going to cover a lot of lower paid employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| and give some good protection, I think, to those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| To your average employee and your higher paid employee, the $40,000 is not going to give so much protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| So my recommendation to have something that would be relatively meaningful to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| some percentage of your population would be to use the $40,000 for all members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| Councilman Dalbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| What I understand is that the average age of our employee base in general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| or fire and police is what, 45-ish, 40-ish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| What are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| In other words, you said the salary was $42,800 for general government, $47,000 for fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| What's our average population age, if you will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| There's 522, I guess, police and what, 340 firemen or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| I think I've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4177)|
| 1:09:50| Actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| I don't have the exact number in front of me, but I think you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| For the general government, well, for both, it's probably early to mid-40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| Early to mid-40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| What about folks in the service group there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| Not community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| Fire and police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| No, it's the service group in general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| David Brace Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| We were talking about those because the gentleman was talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| Yeah, I don't think I have further breakout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Is that younger or older, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Police tend to be younger, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| Police tend to be on the younger side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| And I would think that the public service team would be more like the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4233)|
| 1:10:41| Yeah, I would say, well, the average policeman's salary is a little bit higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| so I would infer that the average policeman is probably a little older than the average fireman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| Well, or their step increases are bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| I mean, that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| The point I was making is that even though your current employee's average compensation is up into the 40,000s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4258)|
| 1:11:07| those are people that are mid-career on average because it's the average of everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| which means if you looked at everybody that was just within five years of retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| generally the longer service people are going to be, not always, but generally higher paid people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| Yeah, the average pay at retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| In other words, we have a number that's comparable to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| I don't have that in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| You expect it to be higher, I guess, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| What's the average pay for an individual working in Knox County or Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| What's our average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| About $44,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| Oh, in the entire county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| I thought, well, I don't have those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| I don't have any idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| Isn't it $34,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| I think $33,000 to $34,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| I think that's household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| That's household, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Oh, that's household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| You had some numbers in that you compared us to Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| That was household income?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| Is that a census number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| I don't think we have those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Well, what you're trying to get at here is you're trying to get 60% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| You're not trying to give them $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| You're trying to give them 60% of $40,000, which is only $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| And if that number is less than their defined contribution rate of return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| and so $24,000 in this case, that's the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| That's what they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| They get $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| They get $2,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| So, I mean, it's not $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| We're not trying to pay them 100% of their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| And then it's capped at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| So if you earn $60,000, it's capped at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| And if you only make $35,000, it's at $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| So you're just trying to get them 60% of their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| And I think $40,000 is fair and $24,000 a year for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| I mean, I move to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Doesn't it depend on whether it's indexed also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| I took that $24,000 figure and took a 15% income tax rate from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| So that meant the person would actually get $20,400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| and that would come out to $1,700 a month or $392.30 a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4410)|
| 1:13:38| It's not very much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| So I think that for us to reduce the amount lower than $40,000 would just be not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4420)|
| 1:13:49| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| I was just asking that it seems to me we need to look at item number two with item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4431)|
| 1:13:59| If we index it, that means we're going to increase it every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| May I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| The indexing, unlike the COLA, where future indexing is a cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| the indexing of the breakpoint is not creating an additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| The indexing of the breakpoint is to try to keep the cost stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| and to try to keep the amount of protection, relatively speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| for your lower paid employees approximately the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| So, for example, if you did not index it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| and 20 years later you still have a $40,000 base and your average pay is $60,000 a year or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| I mean, you're just not helping anybody because nobody is making those levels anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| So if the objective is to keep the risk profile, which is currently about 50-50, relatively stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4488)|
| 1:14:58| then you would want the breakpoint to approximately keep track with the cost of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| or your increases in your average salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| So I would suggest if you do not index the breakpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| that within a relatively few number of years it becomes relatively meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Yeah, I was just going to say that using modern technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| there's something called citydata.com, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| It gives the, again, median household income, and that's not individual income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| at $31,900, so call it $32,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| For Tennessee, $42,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| It has a per capita income of $22,000, but that assumes children work and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| That's just dividing numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| So I guess that's all we have is a household income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| But the number we have here seems higher than what the taxpayers are earning on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| And so I wonder if the breakpoint shouldn't be lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| more like the $32,000 or $34,000 or $30,000 or some number like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| May I comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| I'm just asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| The $40,000 indeed may be higher than the average income for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| Ultimately, of course, the benefit that's going out of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| if that $40,000 limit applies, to Ms. Palmer's point, is the 60% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| You know, your average employees are making what they're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| If you set the breakpoint at $30,000, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| it's rarely if ever going to apply to anybody, and you might as well just get rid of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| which I think, you know, part of the purpose of the plan was to provide some additional protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| for your lower paid members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| So if that's still an objective, then I think $40,000 helps achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| But if that's not an objective, then, yeah, take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| Yes, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Well, reducing it to $35,000, you reduce it from $24,000 to $21,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| So you would only be paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| You're saying you're just multiplying by 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Just take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| I mean, I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| We're going to get to the indexing next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Maybe we should talk about the indexing because that really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| Is it some automatic thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| Is it something done every five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| What do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Yeah, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Well, the indexing, as I have recommended it, rather than having just a CPI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| consumer price index of, you know, 2.3% times this and 2.5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| and then you get some hairy number out there, is to apply the index to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| have an unrounded amount kind of over here on the shelf, round it down to the next $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| So it's $40,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| Then at some point it would be $41,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| And then at some point it would be $42,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| You know, each year, if the CPI is 1% or 2% or 3%, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| and then you would round it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| So every year you would have a new indexed amount, a new rounded indexed amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| that might or might not be equal to the prior year's amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| depending on what the adjustment to the CPI was for the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| Councilman Dovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| Doesn't that increase a whole big unknown into this whole analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| We don't know what the pot looks like because it goes up automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| So if we have a year with 10% inflation, are we going to bump up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| I guess I would suggest if you --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| I mean, that's going to be tied to the level of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| So you could as easily say, if we don't know what future salaries are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| we don't know what the ultimate cost is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| But if part of the break point is going to be, you know, tied to salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| then I think it makes some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| You know, you may not know where either one of them are going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| but if they both go the same direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| at least you're having a consistent division as you move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Or at least that was the, you know, that was my thinking in proposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4725)|
| 1:18:53| And the CPI has no max on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| In other words, you don't say CPI up to 3% or some number like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| Yeah, I mean, my thinking was that if inflation goes up 2% or 4% or 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| to the extent your salaries, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| I would hope over the long run would keep pace with inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| perhaps with even some modest growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| You would want the break point to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| And wouldn't this eventually morph into essentially a full defined benefit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| rather than one that's got protection at the low end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| and a fine contribution on the higher end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| I mean, I guess if it was the board's desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| you could say you're going to index it up at CPI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| but such, you know, amount shall never exceed the average salary of current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| I mean, I would guarantee that it doesn't overtake the plan, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| where it's primarily defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| Yeah, because, I mean, if it morphs into a defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| then we're right back in the soup that we started out with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| which is something that we may not be able to afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| If the council desired to index it forward with a $1,000 rounding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| such that the break point could never be more than the average salary of current fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| and police general government members, that would guarantee that that did not, in fact, happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4806)|
| 1:20:17| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Well, I think that originally when we first started talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| being able to control the lever, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| I propose that we come back to council and, you know, every year we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| I'm still kind of in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| But, however, also a year comes around pretty quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| and I think there ought to be some way to kind of quantify what we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| and what the formula is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| I kind of like that last revision there where it's no more than the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| You kind of be able to kind of keep some controls on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| I just like the council having control of these levers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| the ones that really cost us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| And that one there is the one that could, you know, could cost you money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| So I kind of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| I like that little that kind of swayed me over there, the addendum there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| So I kind of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| But I think there ought to be some kind of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| You can always go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| If you're having a great year, you can always go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| So I kind of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4880)|
| 1:21:29| I was just trying to understand it so that I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| Would you repeat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| I think I understand it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| Well, yeah, I think I tend to agree with George with that last twist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| Otherwise, I would like for council to vote on this periodically, whether it be every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| But there's got to be some set, something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| And we need some guideline as to what we would be looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| not just kind of wide open whatever we're thinking at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| So this does provide a little bit of protection on the upper end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| so we don't fall back into that bucket that we find ourselves in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| Well, a 3% raise every year rounding down would basically, if you maxed it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| I mean, this is $1,000 a year rounding down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| That's where, you know, 40% and you go up to 41% and your maximum 3% go to 42%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| I mean, it basically keeps you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| I mean, it's pretty slow growth, but that's the cap is keeping it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| Now it's 3% to 6%, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| I mean, it's a lot higher than what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| But I like that last twist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| I can also live with the last twist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Councilman Del Voco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| I guess my concern still remains that we're taking out the piece that Councilman Wallace started to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| which was that if councils confronted in a world where there aren't dollars to do this in a particular year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4970)|
| 1:23:02| we've given up in some automatic world the control over the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| And, again, we start to get away from how do we be fiscally prudent when everything is out of our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| and in a world of black wells people will say, well, you adopted the index, you're there, so tough noogies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| I mean, it's the problem that we started out with when we talk about the big picture that we've put aside for now is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5002)|
| 1:23:30| can this be a runaway train, this breakpoint thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| So maybe that last fix does it with no more than the average salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| But think about that because that starts to let it get out of your control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| and all of a sudden fiscal planning becomes harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| I think Mr. Del Voco makes an excellent point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| and I would be happy to recommend to revise my recommendation to say CPI rounded down to the nearest thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5030)|
| 1:23:57| with the proviso that the breakpoint may never exceed the average pay of the general government fire and police group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5037)|
| 1:24:04| I think that's very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5044)|
| 1:24:17| Does that leave us with a COLA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| Does that leave us with a COLA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Do you want to take those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| I mean, do we want to lump those together as a --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| I at least want to understand it because I think that's, is everybody comfortable with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| I mean, well, we probably want to vote this up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5073)|
| 1:24:42| I don't hear a lot of dissent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Yes, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| I mean, you know, philosophically I guess I've been not for this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| but what I don't understand is that if the average pay for city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5091)|
| 1:24:59| both fire and police and general services is $44,000 or $44,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| and we're basically providing a benefit package, a defined benefit package for employees up to $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5104)|
| 1:25:13| then, you know, it just seems to me that we're putting ourselves in the same situation that people did 20 years ago or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5113)|
| 1:25:20| I mean, we're not, I don't understand how we're going to end up paying for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| And, again, it goes back to what I asked the last time in terms of how we're going to pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| because what we're doing is it seems to me that we're guaranteeing our employees a retirement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| a defined benefit plan up to $40,000 with certain increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| and we're putting all this, we're really putting the burden on the taxpayer again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| The taxpayer is the one that's going to have to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| And we already know what we have to put in this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| and we know what we're going to have to put in next year and probably the year after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| And so are we really helping the whole situation in terms of an equal balance between the city employees and the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5155)|
| 1:26:05| And the taxpayers are the ones, you know, that are out there that are going to have to foot the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| And so, again, when I see that the average pay is $46,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| and we're going to pay a retirement benefit up to $40,000, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5175)|
| 1:26:22| We're paying it up to $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Yeah, the retirement benefit is, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| I mean, I keep saying 60 percent, and that assumes 30 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| So if they've got 15 years of service, you know, then you're talking about 2 percent times 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| So it's, you know, 30 percent of pay, not 60 percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| So, you know, we've got, we're focusing on all these career employees, and there are a lot of career employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5201)|
| 1:26:49| but there's a lot of people that terminate, you know, with less than 30 years too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| So using the $40,000 I do think gives a minimal level of protection for your lower paid employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| who need it a lot more than the higher paid folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| So, you know, if that seemed to be desirable, then that's a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| If not, then, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| You could just as easily say it's $40,000 but it's $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| You could, you know, you could say it's $24,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| but it's reduced proportionally if they have less than 30 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| But your last, but your last, and correct me if I'm wrong here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| but your last, the amendment would take care of that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| The amendment would take care of the concern of the plan becoming primarily defined benefit in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5252)|
| 1:27:40| Even providing the base, you know, $40,000, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| The city is on the hook for some risk for the employees that retire, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| that have the defined benefit plan as their predominant plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| But the 40 is actually we pay out 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| And that's based on if you work 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| We want to, you know, I hear what you're saying as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Taxpayer is still on the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| It's a retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Councilman Speier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Is there a 60% cap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| Under the current plan, there's not a cap on the years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| So they work, I guess they'd have to work 50 years to get 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| If they worked 60 years, I guess they'd get 120%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| Yeah, I think there's a 415 limit that prevents you from getting more than 100% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| There's a dollar limit, a legal dollar limit in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| that no matter what you can't get more than 100% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I'd be for that if somebody worked 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| You wouldn't get it for very many years, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Councilman Grieve, is that an old line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| So do we, I think we probably ought to vote this up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5335)|
| 1:29:03| I want to combine item one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| Take them in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| Take them in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| That's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| Leaving the break point at 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| Recommendation is 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| Mr. Bishop, call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5355)|

| 1:29:40| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| So could you, sorry to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| One more time, summarize your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| Proposal on the index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| Proposal, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| On the index, the initial recommendation was to use the consumer price index,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| round it down to the next $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| and then the amendment to that recommendation was that the break point can never be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| more than the average pay of the current fire and police general government population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5413)|
| 1:30:21| Further discussion on the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5421)|

| 1:30:50| Councilman Gallo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| Councilman Gallo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5454)|
| 1:31:11| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| We're looking at the cost of living, item six, page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| As you probably know, the cost of living adjustment is based on the CPI such that the resulting benefit adjustment may not be less than 3% or more than 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5479)|
| 1:31:32| The current recommendation or the current assumption was that the COLA would be based on the CPI, not less than 0%, not more than 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5492)|
| 1:31:44| I was having some discussions with council members that said they were concerned about that cost of living going up and up when the city couldn't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5504)|
| 1:31:55| I had offered the following recommendation, and that is that if the plan, and when I say the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| what I mean is the bucket of assets that have been accumulated for the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| If the assets available are less than 95% of the liabilities that have accumulated, then the full COLA amount would not be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5528)|
| 1:32:20| If it's between 80% and 95%, only half of the regular COLA, whatever it would have been, would be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5540)|
| 1:32:29| If the funding drops to less than 80%, one-fourth of the COLA that would normally be paid would be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5549)|
| 1:32:39| If the funding is 95% or better, then the full CPI COLA limited to 3% would be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5559)|
| 1:32:48| And the council could, at its discretion in the future, if there were several years that the plan had been less than 95% funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| if it desired to do an ad hoc COLA at some point in the future to make up for smaller prior COLAs, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| they would always be able to do that at their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| But the primary core of this is CPI zero to three with limitations as described if the plan does not stay at least 95% funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5584)|
| 1:33:17| So taking the plan, the assets in our plan right now, what percentage funding are we based on, whatever the assumption is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5597)|
| 1:33:27| I don't know if it's six and a half or seven and three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| The current funding is approximately, I think, 78%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5610)|
| 1:33:37| So under the current plan, they would get one-fourth of a regular COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| And that's at seven and three-eighths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| I believe that's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| Some of the last valuation that was performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| You recommended here that the council may, at its discretion, provide ad hoc COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| Would that be on a yearly basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| No, it would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Ad hoc just means at any time in the future that the council desired to revisit the COLA issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| felt that retirees had gotten behind because COLAs had been smaller than expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| they could come back and make an adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| So this really, the ad hoc isn't really tying you into any future action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| It's just saying, at your discretion, if you wanted to do something in the future, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| Councilman Delbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| What about in the other direction if you thought it was too high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| Can you reduce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| Is that a one-way street or a two-way street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| No, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| If COLA has been given, you could not go and reduce it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| If you can't say, well, the plan is 120% funded, you know, yeah, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| You can't reduce the COLA that's been awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5688)|
| 1:35:01| Is the first retiree under this plan ten years out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| You have to have ten years of service, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| Or you're withdrawing, effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5709)|
| 1:35:22| Anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| Mr. Stegg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| I'm just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Does the COLA goes up and down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| The COLA would always be between zero and 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| It goes up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| I mean, it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| It's always a positive number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| It's not a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| You know, when you say down, you wouldn't have a negative 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| Even if the CPI was negative, you wouldn't have a negative adjustment to people's benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| But if one year it was, say, 2.5% and then the next year CPI is 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| It would go 2, 1, 2, 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| Down between zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Yes, it goes up and down between zero and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| So it's maxed out at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| I mean, if CPI goes to five, it's maxed out at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| So if it's at one, it's at one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| That's a little more complicated, you know, than what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5765)|
| 1:36:15| But, you know, I think it keeps it in range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| It keeps it between zero and three at the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| You know, I'd like to be voting on it each year, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| I guess that's but I don't know how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| Wouldn't you do that at budget time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| You do that at budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| Because you're about one month before the end of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| You know sort of where you are when you hit budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| I mean, you kind of know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| It lays it kind of subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| I think the fear is it lays it kind of subjective if you don't have a formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| I don't know of a better formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| If you can come up with a better formula, I'm certainly willing to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| I mean, I'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| After spending, I guess, an hour and a half with nine of us working on numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| I think I don't know if I'd like to have that vote every year of trying to decide between one, zero, and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| I think a formula is not a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| You like the formula and then that way you'd know what it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| With a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| With a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| I mean, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| Dr. Lyons, anything you need to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| I was just clarifying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| We're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| I think that the formula would probably be a better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| And as Mr. Pinkham pointed out, if we have a period of time and the retirees are really down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| and then suddenly we have boom times, there could be a one-time council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| The mayor could include that perhaps in the budget or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| But I think that a formula helps retirees better understand where they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| and what they'll have as opposed to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| And some councils might be very generous and others might be very frugal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5877)|
| 1:38:04| Councilman Delbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Yeah, I'm sitting here scratching my head thinking it's taken us, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| eight or nine meetings to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| I'm wondering how many voters are going to understand any of this if this is on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| And I realize they're going to get 200 words and not all this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| But there's enough complexities here to confuse the average bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| And I kind of worry about how you explain this in a way so that you have an actual intelligent voter reaction to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5908)|
| 1:38:37| I mean, I have the utmost trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| And I understand that by their nature pensions are complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| I guess it makes me wonder about the divine contribution approach just because you know what you're paying into the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5923)|
| 1:38:51| And if you have a good year, you could actually throw extra dollars in the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| But you're never at risk of knowing what the market is or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| And you don't have to sweat at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| I mean, I wonder what the voters will understand as they look at this brief explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| And then the percentage, the small percentage, say 25 percent, go to the website and try to read the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5950)|
| 1:39:16| I wonder what they're going to learn without Alan sitting next to them explaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| He's going to work that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| You're going to sit with them, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| I was just going to offer one other piece of information for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| Even if the board, even if the council decided to vote on the CPI COLA every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5968)|
| 1:39:37| if they had a pattern of approving the CPI and then decided not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| there have been court cases where the court said, well, you've approved it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| It's essentially automatic COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| You no longer have the right to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| Whereas if you build the formula in, it is what it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| So I think you get some additional protection from that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| That's Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| Your explanation, I must say, was very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| And given whatever assumptions we come with, and if we come with a lower assumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| we're going to find currently that we are not funded so there would be no COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| In other words, we'd be less than the 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| You said we're 78 percent now at seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| Well, I guess what I should clarify is I think we've got the current bucket of assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| and liabilities over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| I'm trying to use that as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| Yeah, I mean, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| Under the current scenario, yeah, we'd be starting right off with a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| Understand that's going to be a different bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| So as confusing as that is, that's not going to appear on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| The very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Yeah, there's going to be a statement that says we'll close Plan C and G or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| And that we adopt a hybrid kind of plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| And it will have some features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| I guess we'll try to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Maybe that it shares market risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| And it's a choice between two pots or something, depending on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| Mr. DellaVolpe, the current language is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| Very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| It says close the current plan, put in a new hybrid defined contribution, defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| as it's described in, you know, Charter Amendment, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| But it doesn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| But don't you have to estimate costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Usually you have to estimate costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| You have to estimate costs if you're going to amend the plan to improve benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| You say, well, what's the additional cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| But not if you're going to adopt it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| No, because there's not any immediate additional cost impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| It's just this is what we're doing for new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| So the voter doesn't know whether this is going to be expensive downstream or inexpensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| Yeah, we're not putting cost projections and saying, if you do this, this is the cost in 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| or no, that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| With the little things that we've done today with age and this and that, how does this look now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| I mean, will there be some kind of run that you make that kind of incorporates whatever changes we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| There haven't been any changes that would materially impact the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| I can go back and rerun it, but I think you'll find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| What's your definition of material, 5 percent, 10 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| What's material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| Yeah, I mean, if the long-term cost is 8 percent, you know, to me, material is more than plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| or minus 50 basis points or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| I mean, relatively small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| 50 basis points being a half a percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6139)|
| 1:42:27| I was just going to make one point, I think, that I'll ask Alan to make sure I'm correct on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| But really the COLA, especially with folks now retiring earlier, what it is now is the huge cost driver in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| I mean, as big as any of our factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| I think the reduction of the COLA we're talking about is, you know, especially given to what we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| is very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| Yes, I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| That's the biggest driver is the COLA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| It's not the biggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| I mean, the biggest driver probably is the multiplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| But after the multiplier, probably the COLA is the next biggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| The multiplier of the 2 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| What's the multiplier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| Well, in the current plan, I'm thinking, you know, the current Division C plan, if you say what's the biggest driver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| we were saying that the COLA in the current plan is driving most of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| You know, the 2.5 percent fire and police multiplier is driving a lot of the cost as well in the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| In the new plan, it's really a combination of the 8 percent, 10 percent is really the basis for the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| The contribution credit, that's really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| The contribution rate that you put in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| The additional amount you put in if there's a defined benefit risk in terms of market events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6214)|
| 1:43:40| Yes, the combination of those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| But primarily, it's the 8 percent, 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| That's the big driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| I was thinking of, I mean, we had an agenda item, and I don't remember what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| but we do our pensions on an automatic kind of vote, a consent vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| We had about four or five of them last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| One of them was a 50-year-old police officer who had put in 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| And so he met the rule of 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| And my memory was that he would retire at roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| And, of course, you know, he abided by all the rules in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| He earned the pension that he got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| My recollection was that he would start at $34,000 a year in his pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| And if he's age 50 and lived 30 years, I calculated it out using, because I'm not real good at math, 3 percent each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6260)|
| 1:44:28| And by the time he was 80, he was getting paid $84,000 or $5,000 a year, and it was $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| And so we had to have enough money in the pot to pay $1.6 million over time after he retires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6274)|
| 1:44:42| You're talking about something a little different, I guess, the annuity that you, I don't know whether you buy it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| from an insurance company or whether you just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| No, it was self-funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| And you self-funded in the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| Yes, yes, correct, self-funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| But it was about $1.6 million it added up to if you looked at the person living to a normal age of, say, 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6296)|
| 1:45:03| I mean, that was a sizable sum of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| Are you saying you like or don't like the current recommendation for the COLA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| No, I'm just trying to think of, you know, how do you contain your costs in, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6312)|
| 1:45:19| Well, I think our point is this contains the cost way more than it is now because there's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| There's no question this is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| And they're compounding at a much lower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| Instead of a floor of three, it would be CPI capped at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| So that would make your example that you used, that same person under this scenario would not get anywhere near that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| And so the question I'm struggling with as I sit here thinking, are all these levers effective to protect us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6338)|
| 1:45:46| or are we smarter saying just go with a straight defined contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| and know that we're putting in 8 percent and 10 percent and the market risk is what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| but it doesn't hurt the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| And that's, I keep asking myself that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| I guess the more protections we put in here, the less risk we put on the taxpayers, and that's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| but there's a way of avoiding that and that's just paying money into a pot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| and it's the employees to take with them whenever he leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| I mean, there's that option and I keep struggling with what's the better way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| I know you can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| I'm struggling with it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| I mean, the one thing that has been influential in my thinking is the example that I gave at one of the prior council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6382)|
| 1:46:31| where, you know, in a defined benefit plan, you have the shared mortality risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| So maybe you've got half the people living longer and half the people living shorter, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| so if everybody had, you know, a half million dollars in the account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| and you gave everybody a life annuity of $50,000, you know, half of those people might live more than 18 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6409)|
| 1:46:55| let's say the 18 years that he's expected, and half might die sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| What's the 18 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Where did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Life expectancy for a retiree, let's say, at 62, so age 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| Oh, but not the 55 or the 56?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| Yeah, I'm just making up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| 62, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Yeah, I'm just making up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| You're saying 80 is probably a normal age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| So that's a normal age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| So if everybody has a half million dollars saved, then the plan with reasonable assumptions might be able to afford everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| a $50,000 a year benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| Where if that person had a half million dollars in a defined contribution account and took out $50,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| that lasted 18 years, then half those people, you know, if they managed their money well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| which is another issue, might have enough money to live on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| The other half are not going to have enough money to live on because they're going to outlive, you know, the 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| You're saying on average A lives longer but B lives shorter and so it works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| The whole idea in a defined benefit plan is that you share that mortality risk so that for a smaller pot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| you can guarantee people a lifetime benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| Then, you know, if I was retiring at 62 and I want, you know, enough for $50,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| and on average I have to have $500,000, then I probably really want a million dollars to make sure I don't run out of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| So in a defined contribution account, to get the same standard of living and same security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6487)|
| 1:48:13| So you need a bigger pot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| What about when you throw in the survivor benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Doesn't that moderate so that everyone lives about the same age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| Yeah, I mean, the whole point is if you have 1,000 or 2,000 people to share that risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6501)|
| 1:48:27| then you have some people living longer and some people living shorter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| but it takes you less dollars on average to provide the same monthly benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| It's just more efficient to do in a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| The big problem that I believe that resulted in the situation we're in is taking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6517)|
| 1:48:43| assets that were backing $400 million of inactive liability and investing that money as if those people were still active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6523)|
| 1:48:51| which created more volatility, which as long as the volatility was up, you know, life is good, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| But then when it went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| High tide floats all boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| Right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| That's what we're saying in the investment world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| So my suggestion in going with a hybrid plan, we're moderating risk by sharing the risk between the employees and the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6544)|
| 1:49:10| I'm also have been recommending and will continue to recommend new investment and de-risking strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6550)|
| 1:49:16| regardless of what defined benefit plan we have going forward, to further mitigate the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6561)|
