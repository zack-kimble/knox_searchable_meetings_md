| 0:00:30| All right, I'm going ahead and call it to order. Let's go ahead and recognize that Commissioner Anders, Commissioner Bussler, and Commissioner Daley are here present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=30)|
| 0:00:41| Approval from the last meeting in January, we don't have in front of us, so we'll skip that if it's okay and do that in our next Rules Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=41)|
| 0:00:51| Any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| All right, discussion and possible actions on creating a legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=55)|
| 0:01:01| That was brought up last month's meeting or whatever, to look at doing a legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=61)|
| 0:01:08| I've been thinking about it, and I'll get y'all's opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| Is this a committee that the chairman can set up as a standing committee or as an ad hoc committee to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=71)|
| 0:01:20| I think if we're going to do a legislative committee, which I think personally we probably need to look at doing one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| we need to set it up to where how many's going to be on that, what is their duties, what are they supposed to do, is my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=85)|
| 0:01:35| So I'm open for suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| What's your idea of why it's necessary to form a legislative committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| I think we ran into a situation this year that some bills got by us that we were not really following that closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=104)|
| 0:01:54| that we as a commission probably should have been looking that closer and maybe helping out our state delegation on pushing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=114)|
| 0:02:03| And if we've got certain people, and we will probably have to call, if we do set up a legislative committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=123)|
| 0:02:12| that means that we're going to have to call meetings because we can't call each other and talk to each other about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| say, hey, we need to watch HR Bill 1233 and SB 1214 because we'd get in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=136)|
| 0:02:25| So this would be a committee that we would have to, during the legislative section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| probably starting in January through April, May, that it would be really busy at that point in time just following up on bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=151)|
| 0:02:41| I'll call on, if you all don't care to give me the privilege, I'll call on Commissioner Schoonmaker over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| He's more familiar with the way the bills are set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Just because it's listed in the system does not mean that all the information is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| Correct, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| So we've got to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| We've got to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| You've got to drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| If there's an amendment added, amendment that might be added to change the whole bill totally from what it was really introduced as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| And if we don't have someone there following it for us, I think we could be hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| What do you think, Charlie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| Can I just add one quick question to what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| The law director may want to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| If we're discussing a bill that's voted by the Tennessee legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| there should be no reason why we can't talk about that amongst ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| If you're going to do a joint resolution for or support or against it, you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| If you're going to vote on a resolution for or against that bill, you're in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| But if we vote on a joint resolution, that means it has to come before the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| But you can't discuss it prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| The way it works is if you cannot discuss anything that may come before you as a commissioner for a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| if you're a committee, then it has to be sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| If that topic is something that may come before you for a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| and that's what Commissioner Anders was basically saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| if you're going to vote on a resolution to support something, then your meetings have to be sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| But that means sunshining meetings is no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| I mean, just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Like I said, some of what he's talking about is that these bills are stacked in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| and then they're brought to the floor out of a committee from Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| and that committee is recommended to go on to the floor for discussion in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| So really that bill would not, unless they're going to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| most of the time they're just discussing it before they vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| They may send it back to committee and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| But what I think Carson's talking about, one of these bills comes up that you miss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| and it says, all of a sudden you say, whoa, we should have been calling our legislators down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| and saying, you know, this is going to affect us in an adverse way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| So therefore, and now Charlie Curtis, who is our liaison with the TCCA, does a very good job on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| but some of the times he's dealing with 1,900 to 2,000 bills each legislative period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=314)|
| 0:05:25| And so that's where we could come in to double check to make sure that these are not going to adversely affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=325)|
| 0:05:35| And then there's also this thing where there could be four of the same bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| They're the same bills written just a little bit differently but deal the same subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| And I think that's where we get in where we miss those bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| I think this legislative committee, if set up correctly, could really help us in the line of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| and I've brought it up before, if we hire a lobbyist, the chair of the legislative committee could be the point contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| Instead of having nine commissioners talking to the lobbyist, you've got one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| So I think if this is set up correctly, the legislative committee could be very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| And I think if you pulled five commissioners in on the legislative committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| and then if we do come around and hire a lobbyist, that could be your point of contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| And it kind of goes to what Charlie was saying and what you were saying about getting lost in the shuffle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| And so the County Commission Association can't represent us on everything because sometimes it's 91 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| And so we've got to have our say down there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| So I think if you set up a legislative committee, the opportunity to kind of answer one of the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| who's the lobbyist to answer to, that could be your person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| So I think it could be very effective if we set up a legislative committee of five in the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| just like any other standing committee that we have, and give it a test run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| So I'll make that motion that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| All right, do we hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| I'll do a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Do we need to go ahead and this will set up a legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| Will we have to have the chairman appoint those five or will we elect those five for this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| Mr. Law Director, how will that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| My thought was to have the chairman appoint five or seven people to look at developing a legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=449)|
| 0:07:39| They meet and come back with a criteria of what it's going to be, and then we'll bring it back and set it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| What I was thinking about here, too, is if you point these people to this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| we've got to know what we're basically looking for and where we drop down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| And when a bill comes as a briefing from us, because all those briefings come to us through the TCCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=477)|
| 0:08:05| it's for us to go in there and have that committee and say, okay, we've got 20 bills down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| We need to find out how these affect us and then divide those bills up between the committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| Because if you have 20 and you have to read down through there in that legislative lingo and what they're using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| and to make sure that there's no tied bills to them before they hit something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| and all of a sudden somebody adds something to it, then we've got to look at that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| And we've got to have that person communicating with the person we have in Nashville telling us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| is there anything to it that's going to the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Is there additional information on there that we haven't seen yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| It could happen 30 minutes before it goes to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| And, therefore, we could have somebody at a point person, like a Charlie Curtis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| and say have that bill pulled because we're not in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| We don't know one way or the other until we see what's added on to the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| Well, I think instead of having the chairman, why don't we have whoever is interested in being involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| You know, we can all meet, whoever is interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| You know, we have about five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Is there five of us that normally attend the conferences and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| And then we can all meet and decide the steps of it to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| I think it's a great idea and we've talked about it for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| I think maybe we ought to open it up to what commissioners would like to be involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| or to have it say so, and then, yeah, to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| And then let's plan and have a meeting from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| Mr. Chairman, can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Yes, Mr. LaGrange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Here's where this is different than the TCAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| TCAA has their thing, they do their thing, they represent their thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| and they send people to represent their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| If you're having a committee here, in the end, commission's going to have to give them the directive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| here's the bills we support because they are not the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| and they don't have the authority like TCAA to say, well, this is what's good for us, this is not what's good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| They need to bring whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| They've got to have a charter or something to give them the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| If you go with Commissioner Anders' model, the commission has to delegate certain authorities and structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=621)|
| 0:10:30| and they're abrogating some of their power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| This committee advises the bigger commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| They get their directives from the bigger commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| And so it's a little different than this state thing because they are the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| This is a sub-step, but in the end, you all have got to say, these are the bills that we want you to lobby on our behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| these are the bills we want you, here's what we want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| Because as a commission, six of you may think it needs to go this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| and three of you may think it needs to go another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| And so it's not one person saying, or even this committee saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| because they're speaking on behalf of the overall commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| And that's where all of this will have to come together some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| either with a charter directive for this board or however you all want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| And I want you to understand that it's a step to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| The commission gives the final directive to however you set it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| So in essence, it's better to have the chairman form an ad hoc group of people right now to see if we can form it before September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=693)|
| 0:11:43| So I'll reform my motion to have the chairman set up an ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| the chairman of the commission set up an ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| to look into how that should be formed, what its purpose should be, and what its intent should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| and then come back, and we'll come back in September and see if we can get it pushed into our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| I'll withdraw my second on yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| Chairman Bussler, Vice Chairman Bussler, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| So now we've got the motion on the floor is that we ask the chair to do an ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| to look at forming a legislative committee, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Is there any reasoning that we're going to tell the rest of the commissioners that are not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| why we're doing this and what the purpose of it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| I would ask the chairman to do that when, at that point in time, we can't inform them of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| But at this point in time, I've never set up a committee before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| I have for a, you know, like candor marble board or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| But to me, this is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| We've got to set up an ad hoc committee to form the rules, the regulations, and how many, all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| before I would feel comfortable coming before a county commission saying, hey, this is a legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| I just need to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| The ad hoc committee will develop the guidelines for the larger county commission body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=798)|
| 0:13:29| Just state that again, because that's what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| that you're asking the chairman to develop an ad hoc committee to develop guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| so that the county commission, the entire commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| can understand those guidelines for our priorities in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| No, we're asking the chairman to set the guidelines to appoint, say, five people to appoint a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=829)|
| 0:13:59| to look at appointing a legislative committee and what those rules for that legislative committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| chair, vice chair, why are you there, who do you report to, and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| Of course, we know who they report to would be the whole 11 members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| Yeah, we said the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Does that make sense now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| It's really just an organized thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| It's an organized thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| This is going to be more than one or two meetings to organize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| Mr. Nystrom, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| In other words, we're forming a committee to evaluate how we're going to form the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| And I'll say we've got eight commissioners here right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| so two at large aren't here, which won't be getting new ones in September anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| so we're only missing one that wouldn't know about what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| All right, any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| I have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| All right, item four on our discussion list is the discussion of possible action on zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| adding rules for zoning meetings and appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| On page two, you will find a suggestion that I had set down with the law department, Mr. Daniel Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=912)|
| 0:15:21| Item 10 says our current rules shall be listed as on the agenda at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| Really, we have no rule, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| We've just taken it in the previous that the chairman had the discretion to either grant or to hear or to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=929)|
| 0:15:38| So everybody, hopefully you had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| I'm going to give you a few seconds to read over the proposed rule for number 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| and then when you get done, I'll make a comment and then have the law department make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=944)|
| 0:16:11| Okay, is everybody ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| The sentence that starts out, the chair may approve the deferral to the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| Last month's meeting, we had this brought up, and I thought it was the way it was handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| We just didn't have a rule about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| There's a lot of things that can happen between different, from work session to commission meeting night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| So all this is is stating that we would have a rule that would be left at the chairman's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| This is codifying what you all have done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| My understanding is the chairman has the right to defer or not defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| We let him do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| This way, you have a formal statement that if they receive a request for a deferral from zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| they can evaluate that, make a decision on it, and then have it put on the agenda as deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| That's the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| That's what is before you anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Yeah, I'd like to have anybody consider maybe just adding a line in there in regard to allowing the applicant one deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1037)|
| 0:17:29| instead of multiple deferrals on chairman discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Somebody can get them, based on the commission, can defer it all they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| But a chairman's deferral, adding it to where it's just one, because I think that kind of eliminates that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| It's kind of like a trial lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| The defense will ask for a reset until somebody doesn't show up, and then they get what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| So let's try to prevent them from doing that just through the consent of the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| So your suggestion after that sentence that the deferral will only be allowed for one request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| Request a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Somewhere in there, Jill can wordsmith it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| The chair may approve one deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| One deferral per applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| Or per item and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Per application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Because this is going back to mine, I think, is why all this is brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| And that all got turned around on us because I didn't ask for the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| The developer agreed to have a deferral, wanted it deferred, and I made the motion to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| Well, I don't think you make rules based on one circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Yeah, but I mean this is where that's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| And so since we gave them 60 days and they should have not had another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| Well, and that's why I don't want the developer or the applicant, it could be a non-developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| so the applicant to continue using the chairman to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| It's got to be a commission decision after one shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| I think that's a fair deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| I do know in BZA you've got one time and that's all you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| You can request one time and it's over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| I can't hear you, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| BZA, MPC, developer, applicant gets one automatic deferral, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| If requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| If requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| I don't think it should be up to discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| That leaves controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| I think we should have a hard rule that says if they request it, they get it one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1170)|
| 0:19:39| You know, I think you're right about that, Randy, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| because it really puts the chairman in a horrible situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| And they were playing all the commission on that vote right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| So, because they went ahead and contacted the law department and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| yeah, it could be deferred and all, and they wanted to act like I was the one that had done it and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| So, I think I tend to go with what Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| I mean, did you already make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| You didn't make a motion, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| No, I didn't make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| I'm going to add something else, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| You only get one add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Only one add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| I'm not going to be calling you in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| I also wonder if there should be a defined date on here that if it makes the agenda, it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| If they get it in before it's on the agenda, it can be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| Because I don't like the idea of people showing up at the last minute and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| okay, I want to use my automatic deferral after people went to the trouble to organize and get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| I could understand the start of a work session, but the agenda is printed three weeks prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| A lot can happen in that three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| And so, at the beginning of a work session, end of business day Friday before the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| That's why we can at least make it, it can be deferred, announced, like it kind of did last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| But I don't want anybody showing up the day of the regular meeting saying, I want my automatic deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| I don't think that's right on many levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| I agree with you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| I think that, you know, even though a lot of times we look at it, the applicant there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| they're the ones that has the right to be heard is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| Just because there's oppositions there, they can there to be speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| but they're not really granted that authority through our ordinances to do that, to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| I don't want to use the word influence or whatever, because we've got to look at the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| We've got to look at the zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| We've got to look at the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| That's what we've got to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| I don't want someone coming on a Monday commission work night and somebody asks for deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| You know, matter of fact, I'd vote against that period as far as that goes if it came up for motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Now, I do want to make it clear that if it is a night of a discussion and we get into the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| and it becomes obvious that both sides need more time to talk to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| that a deferral could still happen at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| There's going to be some things in there, even though they may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| it may be on the agenda, say, for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| How many times have we got together and say, well, Mr. Developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| will you work with this homeowners group and come back next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| You know, to me, that's a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Now, who's that deferral on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| Well, you're talking, what you've done is you've changed this to an automatic deferral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| and any other deferral is before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| So y'all can defer 68 times if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| All this that you're addressing right now is the way you've amended it is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| each applicant has the right for one automatic deferral, and they have to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| if I'm hearing it right, the Friday before the workshop agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| No, Friday before the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Is that what you said, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| End of business before the Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| 5-4-30 on the Friday before workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Or the end of business the day previous to the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| But that does affect deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| As a body, y'all can do whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| The automatic deferral has to come before end of business the day prior to the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| And what that does, because sometimes work session's on a Tuesday, so you can't say Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| End of business the day prior to the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| The time of day, though that's something else, if it comes in at, what is our time of day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1415)|
| 0:23:44| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| But if it does come in, say at 4-50, and then we're pushing it real to the end of where we can't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1427)|
| 0:24:01| I don't know how soon we can get it online to show what there's change that's been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| It could be announced at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| But what I'm saying is, could it be instead of end of work the day before or the day before, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1450)|
| 0:24:19| the work session goes on the Friday before, make it 12 noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| That way we can get information out to all the commissioners that has been changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| and can be publicized, I guess, quicker and being read on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1470)|
| 0:24:39| You know what I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| I mean, if you say 5 o'clock on Friday and somebody puts it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| 4-59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| 4-59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| I mean, it's got to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| I mean, that's the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| But if you say 12 noon, then it's on there and gives time to put it out that the agenda or something on there that has been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1491)|
| 0:25:00| It's not going to be heard for seven days, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| I thought the work session was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| Hey, is this like the courts have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| If somebody brings a detainer warrant or any kind in any of these offices, they close at 4-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| They bring it in at 4-29, we've got to file it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| It doesn't matter if we stay past 4-30 to file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| It's stamp and email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| It's got to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| So I'll make a motion that we accept the rule with adding the automatic deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| She'll only be made if requested by the end of business the day before the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| To the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| To the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Or to the commission office, because she can time stamp the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| Yeah, it would be kind of hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| The chair may be in Hawaii.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| So the automatic deferral is granted if it's received end of business in the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1550)|
| 0:25:58| before end of business the day prior to the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| By the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| It has to be the applicant that gets this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| Or their agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| All right, do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| All right, we've got a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Any other further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Remember, if it's 5 o'clock, don't work, or the end of business day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| we can always go back and change it to 12 in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Let's just get something going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| But you're talking about the Friday before the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| The end of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| It could be a Thursday, because it could be off that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Yeah, it could be a holiday or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| That's up to the developer on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Or that's up to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| All right, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| We are on item five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| That is discussion of possible action on resolutions to be vetted by the law department for adding to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| The reason I added this one, and I'm the one that added this, I hate to be blindsided as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| We've been blindsided a time or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| So I went to the law department and asked their feelings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| So I'm going to turn this over to Bud and let him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| Well, I would request we just let it die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| The truth is for this, number one, the way it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| it's going to throw everything 30 days in the head if we have to have it by the agenda time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| And then we have things that really need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| And I personally don't like the idea of the law director having anything to do with setting your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| And if we were going to do anything, if you wanted to do something, and it's up to you, it's totally policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1648)|
| 0:27:36| you might say that anything added to the agenda after your deadline shall be noticed to the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1656)|
| 0:27:46| I mean, at least we get a copy so we're prepared to talk to you about whatever it is if you ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| But as far as inserting us in your agenda process, I don't think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| That's what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| You can either drop this or go to some other approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| There's no approval by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Yeah, I think it sets a standard that it may not be something that the law director fundamentally agrees with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| and he can drag it out as long as he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| There's no reason to put them in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Now, for them to get – I mean, generally, when I was the chairman, Jill always knew what was coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| because she's the one that – unless somebody threw something in from outside, which very rarely happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| But generally, those come through the law department anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| because I, as the chairman, always talk to Jill about form and legal and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| So I think we're okay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| If you put it on there and, hey, it should say forward it to the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| or check for legal form by law – I mean, because you don't want the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| any law department, making your decisions on what goes on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| Chairman Bessler – or Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| I think the term is legal form, and we've had a few items that's come before us that's not been in legal form before it got to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1743)|
| 0:29:12| And that would be the one thing I would want to make sure it's addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| that it is in legal form in what we're doing and what we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| because if it's not in legal form and we vote on it, I don't know how that indemnifies us or what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1761)|
| 0:29:30| If we don't check off in legal form, then we don't know what we can defend or not defend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| But a lot of things come in at the – I mean, you do handouts on Commission Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| and a lot of times y'all will even pass the resolution subject to legal form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| meaning, you know, we've got to work out any kinks and y'all say this is what we want to do from a policy standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| and we go and do the legal form piece and then it goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| We – you know, it's not a – like Commissioner Anders said, it's not every day we get blindsided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| and if we do, you all are generally – follow the law and what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| So either way, I mean, you can just drop this thing as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| or if you want to make sure that the law director's office has a copy of anything that's added after the agenda deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| you can say that, you know, anything added after the agenda deadline shall be forwarded to the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| Just let it go. At least we know – I just want to be prepared to answer your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| and know that it's coming before us instead of, well, I'll have to get back with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| I didn't know that was going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| I don't want to have – I don't want a law director to be in that position, but sometimes we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| It just is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Could we have Drew to do that automatically without even having to have a rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| I mean – or who is, not only Drew, but who is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| You generally do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| I mean, it's just – we've got a good working forum between commission and the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| There's a door between the offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| That's right. We walk in there quite a bit and it goes both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| We get phone calls all the time and say, you know, what do we need, how do we need to work it through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| I think we're okay just because one or two sneaks in on you every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| I think we're all big enough to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| Ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| I just wanted to hear your motivation for putting the item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| I'd like to say I don't like to be blindsided, and the prime example is the sheriff's vote we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| where they wanted us, the commission, to go against the charter and hire a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| which we had no authority as a commission to hire lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| That's not our function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| That's the law department's function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| It was not sent to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| That's what brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| Hopefully that will never happen again, and hopefully, you know, we learn by what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| and hopefully in the future we'll look back and say, well, you know, that didn't go too well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| We won't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Well, I think that one thing that I try to do, if something looks hinky or different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| I always send it to Bud and say, hey, does this, I mean, as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| I've done that a ton of times, and so, you know, does this meet the smell test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| And so I don't think we need a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| That's common sense, but I get what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| But I think the commission office and the law director's office have always worked well hand in hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| and we well know well a little bit in advance whether or not something's legal form or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Well, we'll move right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| I don't see no action needed on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| Item six, discussion and possible action of general government consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| Items to be voted, I say items to be read and voted on after general business completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| I had Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Thank you, Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| If you look at page three, if this is adopted, what we would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| letter L would be the resolutions not on general consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| We would do business first, let everybody go home that needs to go home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| and then we'd read the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| And while we're here, I'll have, I asked the law director, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| why do we have to read the consent calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| So your explanation to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Well, this is a public meeting, and everything you do needs to be stated on the record for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| and they have a right to address you and to, you know, bring their redresses to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| And if you just go through and everything's on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| then they don't know anything about it other than a caption, and some of them don't even know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| So it gives an opportunity for the public to make arrangements to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| and to address the body even in consent as to what it is on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| And it just enhances the openness of our government to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| I'm not sure if it's right to keep people that are there for things that are on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| to hold them hostage until we've went through all the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| Consent usually only takes us 10 minutes to get through, 15 on a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| I also think that this may cause problems for the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| and the commission office as far as keeping records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| and it's going to get a lot of the categories out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| Jill, would you care to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| It would jumble your agenda up more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| You know, items would be out of order, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| so if you're pulling items that are not on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| they would be in a different section of your agenda than the other resolutions in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| So something in the health department could be on the third page and also on the sixth page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| And so I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| I didn't even think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| My concern, as much as I like the thought of doing all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| I mean, my first thought was like, well, let's put ordinances above the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| But at any time in the meeting, any commissioner can pull something off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| So if we send everybody home and then we could get sneaky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| and pull something off consent when everybody's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| And I think that opens that door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I didn't think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| I like the idea of getting everybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| But there's nothing to stop us from pulling something off consent after everybody's out of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| And I think that could set a terrible precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| I think that would be an awful thing to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| So, I mean, I didn't even think about what Jill was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| And at first I was like, well, let's just move it down to the bottom of the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| and do everything, ordinances and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| But, man, you clear the room and clear the consent calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| and vote on whatever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| So that could be very dangerous in years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| Very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| My main concern on this one was that I sat there last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| and it was a very long consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| And I think at one time I counted maybe four commissioners at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Everybody else was gone and doing whatever, talking to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| I mean, you had all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| You had purchasing, which is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you, purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| You had public works here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| I was just trying to look at a way, if it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| If it's going to create a problem, we're not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| If it creates a problem for Jill and for anyone else, we don't need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Just hopefully that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Something else you can do is consciously, as the chairman or whoever is running the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| I think Randy even talked to me about this after the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| and he said, well, we could have done that instead of making everybody sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| We could have moved it in front of consent without everybody sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| And so there are some things that you can do in the meeting that doesn't prolong some people's stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| I mean, like when we get into zoning, this next zoning meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| if our commission meeting goes into zoning, it will be around 9 or 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| So we can start thinking about that ahead of time and clear that stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| But I didn't think about the repercussions of moving the consent to the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| because we could clear it out, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| That would be awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| Other thoughts? Commissioner McGill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| I would agree, and I would just make sure we understand that open government is transparent government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2224)|
| 0:37:14| And there are 11 people at the table and countless other people watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| but we tend to forget that I can make a telephone call and have an answer under consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| but the public doesn't know or have the same level of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| And I think we need to just be conscious of having a particular answer amongst the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| but that doesn't mean the greater public understands that answer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| All right. I see no action needs to be taken. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| All right. We're going to move on to Item 7, discussion and possible action on date, time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| of the commission reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Vice Chair Busler has got that for a discussion item tonight or next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2278)|
| 0:38:06| Well, it's on the agenda where I want to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| We know we're going to have an election every two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| and we know what the calendars are to where we can go ahead and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| okay, you cannot swear anybody in until September 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| because they have their office up until August 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| Tell me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Okay. You can swear anybody in after the certification of their election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| but they cannot take office or make someone's term shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| So, for example, what we're going to have to do this year, and we do it every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| a lot of times you all don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| the Sheriff of Knox County has got to be sworn in on August 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| so that they will be sheriff one minute after midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| Or we don't have any officers on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| because we've got to swear in all of our officers on that same day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| so that we can have law enforcement over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| We have bonded issues that relate to our property assessor, our trustee, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| They've got to be in office at midnight on the night of September 1 coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| So you can be sworn in any time after you're certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| but you do not take office until one minute after midnight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| Now, if you're not sworn in prior to that date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| you do not take office until you are sworn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| and then the person in your seat or whatever at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| it is vacated and you are in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| That's when the oath makes you the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| But I think this year they're even talking about having the entire ceremony on the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| So everybody will become officers at midnight that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| But that's what the law is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| Well, how long does it take to certify the election then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| Ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| So you could have everything done within ten days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| schedule it ten days after or twelve days after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| whatever it is after the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| and then when the first comes, you're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| But all by statutory things, normally you try to do it September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| A lot of times we always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| And they still have the ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| I mean, even the sheriff and the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| all those people go out there and they get their pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| but they're already in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Now, a lot of times commissioners, especially the newly elected ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| they're two or three days late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| They're sworn in on the third or fourth or fifth, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| But these offices that you have to have continuity to, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| it wouldn't be good for Knox County not to have a sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| and all our deputy sheriffs over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| They can't even serve a warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| They can't arrest anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| See what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| And we have the trustee the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| We still have banking and financial responsibilities that go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| We've got to be bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| There are certain things you've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| So once you're certified as the elected person, you can take your oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| and then time installs you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| If time doesn't install you because you don't have an oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| then your oath installs you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| But one of the two will trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| And in our case, time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| But the ceremony was the big thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Well, the ceremony is for further office and family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| But you could have that taken care of in case something happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| You could do the ceremony after 10 days of the certified election any day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| You could even do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| And that's what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| You could have the ceremony on this date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| but the swearing in is on this date to make sure everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| when September 1 hits, we're all ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| We just have the picture taken like what we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| But we should be able to set those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| This is when you're going to be sworn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| but this is when we're going to have the ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| That's all set by the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| and it really depends on where that holiday falls, September Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| This discussion, I think we're off track a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| This discussion is about commission reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| I would like to see a date set not for this commission only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| but for commissions in 2022 or 20, 2022, 24, 26, 28,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| that we know that if the ceremony is September the 3rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| that's on a Tuesday because of Labor Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| one hour later Knox County Commission will convene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| elect a new chair, vice chair, and reorganize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| But you're talking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| The ceremony is run by the mayor's office, the outgoing incoming mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| The commission organization is ran by the prior or current chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| and set by the current chairman for the next commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| So, I mean, there's no reason for us to calendar out until 2028 a ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| or a reorganization because they're going to have 1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| they're going to have 100 rules committee meetings and change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| So there's really no reason to go that far out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| I mean, you've already got a process that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| I don't know what the dilemma is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| The ceremony is run by the sheriff, the organization is run by the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| or the mayor and the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Correct me, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Was it last year we had the wildfires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Or two years ago we had the wildfires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| We were not organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| We took our time, and there was going to be a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| but we couldn't do that because the meeting was, the first meeting is reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| So we did not have a reorganization meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| So say there's something for Knox County alone that on September the 3rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| and we've not reorganized and we need to do an emergency meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| which is a 48-hour notice, we're going to have to organize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| then call a special 48-hour meeting on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| That's one of the things that, and this is me, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| This is nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| This is just me, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| I was elected to do my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| And if I'm told that commission rule says that on September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| the first Monday of September is reorganization except it be Labor Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| it will be the following business day, I will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| That's my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| That's what I signed up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| And that's what I would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| I would like to see a set date where everybody knows that on September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| maybe on a Tuesday, okay, we're going to have reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| If it's on September 1st, it's on a Monday or a Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| it will be the first business day after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| That's why I brought this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| I'm the one that brought this up, nobody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| This one's mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| I was just, you know, and I'm not saying anything bad about anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| but it's just like a Sunday school picnic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Who all can make the third Sunday or third Saturday for a Sunday school picnic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| One of the class will raise their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Then the other third said, I can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| Then the other third said, well, if you guys said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| everybody knows that you're going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| You know what, that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| But does our charter say that we can't have a regular session meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| a work session meeting until we reorganize, or is it any kind of meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| It says that the first meeting after September 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| shall be the reorganization meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Now you can have it and then have an emergency meeting right after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| but the first thing you do is a new commission is organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| That's it, the very first meeting, whenever that meeting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| And you can call that meeting whenever you want it, after or on September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| I agree with Chairman Dabney that there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| it opens the doors to opportunities for things that we would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| possibly emergencies we might need to meet for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| And also, I remember last year we did reorganization work session day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| and that's kind of tough to come in as chairman on work session day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| I mean, you've got like an hour to prepare for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| There was a lot of vacations or something, wasn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Wasn't there something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| We just couldn't come to a day that everybody could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| If there's an emergency that comes up before we reorganize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| well, but you've got those that are already sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| You've got to be organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| That's what happened last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| We actually tried to do that last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| We were trying to do something for the wildfire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| And what happened was if we did a special called meeting to reorganize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| then once we had the reorganization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| we had to have a public notice of 48 hours before we could meet again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| to take action on the emergency meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| So it was a complete disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| And they can't reorganize until they're sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| The first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Yeah, the first time after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| So the 31st, did you say you thought was going to be the swearing in this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| Yeah, but they don't take effect until the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Two totally different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Forget the swearing in part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| It's the first meeting of commission after September or on and after September 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| has to be the reorganizational meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| That's just what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| So you're saying to have it the first business day after September the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| Yes, or on or after September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| First business day on or after September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I mean, do you see a dilemma there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| I don't see a dilemma there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| Subject to availability of a room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| We're going to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| We've already ran into the dates, and Mr. Chairman had trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| and finally he made a decision, which I'm glad he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| that we're going to have the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| We're going to have a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| then we're going to have the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| then we're going to have the vote on the budget because none of us could be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| On all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| On all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Well, this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| We are county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| We are a $1.4 billion business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| And our first order of business after September 1st is to organize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| And I think that the first business day, September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| or the first business day on or after September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| should be commission reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| That might take an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| That might take 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| But that ought to be the first order of business come September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| 2nd, 3rd, whatever that day falls on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| I think looking at the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Labor Day is on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Moving out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| I'm moving out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| It actually doesn't affect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| You know, it's not even in the Labor Day week after this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| It goes back to September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| In 2019, 2020, September 1st is on a Tuesday, which would not be Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2941)|
| 0:49:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| So that's the first business day of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I mean, you applied for the job a year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| I mean, you know what the – I think first business day after September 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| or after is probably an appropriate rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| I mean, I can't see the detriment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| And the only reason I don't want it the first business day, the first Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| you allow business to transpire on a Monday that will probably impact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| And I just prefer – I just really prefer not the first day but the second day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2981)|
| 0:49:50| If you encounter any issue, you're just better off on Tuesdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| the first Tuesday after September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| But then 2020, the first Tuesday is a week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Or not the first Monday, just, you know, just the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| Whatever the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Forget the week of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Focus on September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| September 1st or the next business day after September 1st if it's a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Saturday, Sunday, or holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Do bear in mind now that Commissioner Anders did point out swearing in does play a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3021)|
| 0:50:32| You've got to be sworn in to be reorganized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| So if you do it and a lot – if you don't have a quorum because people haven't gotten sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| and they haven't had their day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| But you can privately swear in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| You're talking about ceremony and swearing in again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| No, I'm talking about swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| But you could swear in right before the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Absolutely, but you've got to be ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| I mean, if you're coming to work to vote for chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| you better come to work with a swearing in attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Yeah, you better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| Commissioner Anders made the point that I tried to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| I applied to be the ninth district representative a year in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| You've got a year of planning, and if you're not – if you're elected as your district representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| you ought to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| So are you forming that as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| You can form it as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| I don't think the chair should form a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| It's your – sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| I will make a motion then that Knox County Commission reorganization will be September 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| or the next business day thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| Got any further discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| I'm a little confused on this because September 1st of this year – of this year is a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| So we're going to reorganize on that Monday, which is the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| It's Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| That's – and that was –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| He says holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| Business Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| We're saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| It's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| We're saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| We're saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| You just – you're wishing Boone's Day was back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| We're saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Any other discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| I did not – or did I copy that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| I don't think I copied it, but there was a discussion – yeah, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| Look on the very last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3148)|
| 0:52:37| Clarification, and I'll clarify to – for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| You will read in the – where the little yellow highlight it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| it is the last sentence says chair of the Commission for more than two terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| per term as Commissioner. I asked the Law Director to clarify that. Would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| please give me your answer? Each Commissioner is is elected to a four-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| term and during that four-year period you can serve twice as Chairman. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| it. You can't serve four years as Chairman. You can serve twice. You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| serve however combination of that it is but that's what the rule says right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| I want to clarify that. I know that in the past couple years that we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3196)|
| 0:53:25| everybody to have an opportunity to be a chair, vice chair, whatever and I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| I would throw it out is this and that's why I went to the Law Department first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| is to see to clarify the term. The term is two years in a term which is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| four-year term. Then you can be reelected and you can be chair for two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| years in your next term. I was just throwing it out to you all. If it don't go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| anywhere that's fine. It doesn't bother me a bit but you know I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| everyone that would like to be chair have an opportunity in that eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| because four years but you may not have that amount of time in the four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| but in eight years you may want to have that time so I'm just throwing this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| for you know do we want to leave it as is or do we have any discussions that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| want to say that it will be two terms as chair for an eight-year period or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3255)|
| 0:54:24| whatever. I'm just asking questions. If you don't want to do it that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| Let's go with anybody on the Rules Committee first. We changed it three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| years ago. I don't think I think it's a good rule and I don't think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| change it. Well everybody has an opportunity. You got to get your six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| That's what it comes down to. So it doesn't matter what we change it to, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| I mean just a clarification then so that because you're elected for two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3289)|
| 0:54:59| four-year terms a total of eight years you could if you had the six votes have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| the potential of serving 50% of your elected term as chairman you could serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| four years as chairman of the Commission. You could serve eight years two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| four years as vice and four years as chairman. Yeah no I'm just thinking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| chairman. Okay so what you're saying is you want to make it so that everybody if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| they wanted to have that option to be a chairman or vice chairman they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Well it's just like Michelle Carringer said. It takes six votes okay to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| elected chair. I just you know we had when we first come on board us five one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3333)|
| 0:55:42| two three four who's the new one you five I think it was us five we got kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| of thrown in a monkey wrench there who wanted to be chair you know promised one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| year and not promised year or whatever all I'm doing was brought this up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| discussion to try to keep us out of that to where it's possibility that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| 11 of us if there's 11 of us I guess technically we could probably all serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| one year terms as chair but over eight years that'd be hard. What do you mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| promise though? Well there was promises made but here's the deal if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| eliminate candidates what if your other people nobody gets six votes then what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| your rule? And then nobody wants to be chair. Don't limit your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| candidate pool I wouldn't do that in an election I don't think we should do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| here. And there's a lot of commissioners that don't have you know may want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| vice chair they don't want to ever be chair or either you know and some may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| don't they don't want to be vice or chair so that's why I don't know how you make it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| where everybody that would like to be how would you do that? There's an easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| way to do that. Thank You Mr. Chairman because I appreciate the open discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| of not always doing the same thing we have done for a million years and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| think as we evolve as a commission we're going to have to value that there are I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| appreciate the six votes we also understand that politics over the six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| votes versus the interest of this county is going to have to be expanded so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| think it's a good item to be discussing long term to make sure we have full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| representation across this county. Mr. Chairman. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| point out that you know we only have one person that's been chair amongst us here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| as long as any of us have served it's been Brad or Dave and now I as being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| coming on as a new commissioner you know how the adjustment period goes. The same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| is true for chairmanship. If we start limiting people to one term you can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| somebody new every year and it's going to be a learning curve over and over and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| over again and and it is sometimes difficult to go through that. I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3473)|
| 0:58:03| saying I'd be weary of limiting everybody to one term as chair. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| think the more people who understand what the process is the stronger the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| commission is. So you'll end up with people who are seasoned and experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| trying to then and if they roll off the commission you still have a learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| curve for all of your new commissioners and it is just as important to be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| emerging learner as it is as an experienced learner. Well in six six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| years it will be one, two, three, four, who else? In the huge five? Did we have six being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3515)|
| 0:58:44| elected last time? Five or six? We'll have a huge term. There's one year we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| huge turnover and that's that where that experience that's where that experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| comes in. Yeah that's where the experience come in and you know I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| the two-year term. I would like and as far as vice-chair goes I have no idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| what the what the vice-chair does with the chair but you know more I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618RulesCommittee?start=3547)|
