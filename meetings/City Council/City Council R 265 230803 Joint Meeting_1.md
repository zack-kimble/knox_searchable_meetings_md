| 2:05:14| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7514.84)|

| 2:05:17| I think that's a great answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7517.36)|
| 2:05:18| And just like Council Member McKenzie was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7518.96)|
| 2:05:23| our state friends may not have been present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7523.4)|
| 2:05:26| but there's probably ways that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7526.5199999999995)|
| 2:05:29| send them a message about those things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7529.6)|
| 2:05:31| So that's very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7531.6)|
| 2:05:33| I also saw a light from Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7533.96)|
| 2:05:37| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7537.4800000000005)|

| 2:05:39| And thank you, Chairwoman Durrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7539.68)|
| 2:05:41| for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7541.4800000000005)|
| 2:05:42| And I wanna thank everyone who is in the fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7542.72)|
| 2:05:45| boots on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7545.4800000000005)|
| 2:05:46| This cannot be an easy job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7546.96)|
| 2:05:48| And I respect every one of you for having to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7548.8)|
| 2:05:53| what you're doing and stand in the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7553.4)|
| 2:05:56| I am gonna have to reiterate what Commissioner Beeler said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7556.360000000001)|
| 2:06:00| I completely agree that obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7560.8)|
| 2:06:04| Knox County Commission and Knoxville City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7564.000000000001)|
| 2:06:07| like we're doing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7567.200000000001)|
| 2:06:08| have to come together and work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7568.320000000001)|
| 2:06:10| because I believe that we can all come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7570.200000000001)|
| 2:06:12| on a common goal for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7572.84)|
| 2:06:15| My issue is when I listen to General Nichols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7575.360000000001)|
| 2:06:18| and he'll always be General Nichols to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7578.960000000001)|
| 2:06:21| but he said that average on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7581.000000000001)|
| 2:06:27| they're dealing, the police officers are dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7587.360000000001)|
| 2:06:29| with 545 people, 52 of those are serious mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7589.4800000000005)|
| 2:06:37| If I did my math right, if we do that on a daily average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7597.040000000001)|
| 2:06:41| that's 217,905 people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7601.000000000001)|
| 2:06:46| that are sick, hurting, dealing with a serious mental issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7606.080000000001)|
| 2:06:51| When I say that I believe we're past the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7611.72)|
| 2:06:55| years past the time of having a mental health facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7615.2)|
| 2:06:57| in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7617.92)|
| 2:06:58| I believe that's probably an understatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7618.76)|
| 2:07:01| I cannot imagine being the patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7621.4)|
| 2:07:05| who is having to drive an hour and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7625.4)|
| 2:07:07| to an hour and 45 minutes to go to Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7627.2)|
| 2:07:09| and also can't imagine being the police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7629.84)|
| 2:07:12| that is transporting this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7632.84)|
| 2:07:15| When you're in a mental health crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7635.24)|
| 2:07:17| when you're in a mental health crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7637.639999999999)|
| 2:07:20| nothing to that patient is real at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7640.759999999999)|
| 2:07:24| and that is extremely concerning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7644.679999999999)|
| 2:07:28| that we are expecting our police officers to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7648.28)|
| 2:07:33| on top of what they're doing in the jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7653.92)|
| 2:07:35| and what they're doing on the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7655.639999999999)|
| 2:07:38| and then putting our patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7658.08)|
| 2:07:41| our community members in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7661.5599999999995)|
| 2:07:44| So it's something that I plan on speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7664.24)|
| 2:07:49| to my state reps about, all of the state reps about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7669.32)|
| 2:07:52| This needs to be a huge priority this coming next session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7672.639999999999)|
| 2:07:57| to be talking about this and not talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7677.0)|
| 2:07:59| Put the money where the mouth is and get the work done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7679.679999999999)|
| 2:08:03| and I'm willing as a county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7683.5599999999995)|
| 2:08:06| to step up and do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7686.8)|
| 2:08:07| but I just also wanna thank the police officers are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7687.92)|
| 2:08:11| I have gotten to know Chief Noel well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7691.360000000001)|
| 2:08:16| a very fine man, and is out working hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7696.56)|
| 2:08:18| in his community, in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7698.960000000001)|
| 2:08:22| and I appreciate Sheriff Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7702.040000000001)|
| 2:08:24| for the work that he's doing in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7704.8)|
| 2:08:26| I know you guys have a really hard job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7706.4800000000005)|
| 2:08:28| so I just wanted to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7708.360000000001)|
| 2:08:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7710.280000000001)|
| 2:08:31| Council Member Sane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7711.160000000001)|
| 2:08:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7713.360000000001)|
| 2:08:35| I appreciate these last couple hours very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7715.280000000001)|
| 2:08:38| I feel like we've had a top to bottom, side to side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7718.000000000001)|
| 2:08:42| view of some of the large issues that are going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7722.2)|
| 2:08:44| but I would like to pull back some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7724.96)|
| 2:08:46| to where council started on getting this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7726.639999999999)|
| 2:08:51| which to me, the crux of the problem is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7731.759999999999)|
| 2:08:56| we have put mental health and dangerous criminal behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7736.599999999999)|
| 2:09:00| in the same basket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7740.96)|
| 2:09:02| and we are here to look at who should respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7742.88)|
| 2:09:07| when there is a mental health crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7747.12)|
| 2:09:09| versus a criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7749.46)|
| 2:09:13| It amazes me to have heard Mr. Harrington talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7753.22)|
| 2:09:17| in 53, we separated the Department of Corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7757.06)|
| 2:09:20| with the mental health, and we're still working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7760.46)|
| 2:09:23| We've got, you know, BHUC, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7763.86)|
| 2:09:26| is working on trying to separate those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7766.5)|
| 2:09:28| The co-responder model is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7768.42)|
| 2:09:30| we have mental health court coming up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7770.7)|
| 2:09:33| So back to the intercept map that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7773.58)|
| 2:09:37| that is about getting mental health, mentally ill folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7777.18)|
| 2:09:43| out of the criminal justice system at different points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7783.02)|
| 2:09:46| And this, to me, this is not about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7786.58)|
| 2:09:52| somehow this has all become about law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7792.0)|
| 2:09:54| and I'd like to see us at the intercept of zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7794.780000000001)|
| 2:09:59| where law enforcement, it's community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7799.26)|
| 2:10:02| and not law enforcement that has something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7802.06)|
| 2:10:06| that doesn't belong in their basket, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7806.9400000000005)|
| 2:10:10| There are, there is an overlap between mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7810.22)|
| 2:10:14| and dangerous behavior, but that's not, it's not one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7814.34)|
| 2:10:18| It's very little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7818.620000000001)|
| 2:10:20| So how do we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7820.34)|
| 2:10:23| I don't want to have this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7823.14)|
| 2:10:25| and then have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7825.500000000001)|
| 2:10:26| Two years ago when we met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7826.46)|
| 2:10:28| now the problem's even larger, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7828.84)|
| 2:10:31| So I'm wondering about the funds for co-responder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7831.1)|
| 2:10:35| and what data and information do we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7835.34)|
| 2:10:38| to start working on other crisis response teams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7838.82)|
| 2:10:42| I know that for the responder model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7842.9400000000005)|
| 2:10:45| you guys had five years of data and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7845.5)|
| 2:10:48| For BHUC, it was 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7848.58)|
| 2:10:50| What do we need to get started on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7850.860000000001)|
| 2:10:55| I guess I'll try to answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7855.82)|
| 2:10:58| You know, I think what we have learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7858.46)|
| 2:11:02| over our conversations in meeting with HART| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7862.5)|
| 2:11:05| and some other providers is that there's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7865.98)|
| 2:11:08| of information that is coming to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7868.98)|
| 2:11:11| that we don't collect data on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7871.38)|
| 2:11:13| We hear and absolutely understand and embrace the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7873.94)|
| 2:11:18| that there are individuals who are afraid to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7878.14)|
| 2:11:20| for service for fear that law enforcement will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7880.86)|
| 2:11:25| That's a very real fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7885.34)|
| 2:11:27| We also know that I think it's challenging for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7887.46)|
| 2:11:33| as Brad talked about a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7893.46)|
| 2:11:35| about when the calls are coming into 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7895.62)|
| 2:11:37| distinguishing which of those could be calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7897.86)|
| 2:11:41| that an alternative response could respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7901.22)|
| 2:11:44| versus a caller that might need a higher level of response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7904.58)|
| 2:11:48| like a co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7908.66)|
| 2:11:50| So I really think what we've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7910.42)|
| 2:11:53| is taking the time to step back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7913.58)|
| 2:11:56| and find out what is the data points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7916.66)|
| 2:11:58| that we need to collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7918.78)|
| 2:11:59| We understand that we have to collect those going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7919.98)|
| 2:12:03| to find out how we need to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7923.26)|
| 2:12:05| and develop a response that meets the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7925.0199999999995)|
| 2:12:07| of all of our citizens, not just that few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7927.34)|
| 2:12:13| So where would we collect this data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7933.26)|
| 2:12:14| Who would be collecting the data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7934.9)|
| 2:12:16| And would the, yeah, let's start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7936.3)|
| 2:12:20| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7940.900000000001)|
| 2:12:22| You know, I think that's up to this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7942.38)|
| 2:12:23| I mean, I think to be in all fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7943.860000000001)|
| 2:12:25| I think it's everybody, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7945.780000000001)|
| 2:12:28| I think that everybody has the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7948.34)|
| 2:12:30| in their own agencies and entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7950.18)|
| 2:12:33| and that's got to be collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7953.14)|
| 2:12:34| and compiled together somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7954.900000000001)|
| 2:12:37| When you were getting the data together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7957.620000000001)|
| 2:12:39| for the co-responder model, who led that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7959.1)|
| 2:12:41| And yeah, who led that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7961.22)|
| 2:12:44| So McNab led that on the co-responder part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7964.14)|
| 2:12:47| We developed an app to follow all of our together data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7967.74)|
| 2:12:52| on all of our calls post-intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7972.46)|
| 2:12:54| So we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7974.86)|
| 2:12:56| We're really proud of that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7976.62)|
| 2:12:58| And we have used that to develop and enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7978.82)|
| 2:13:03| and change the program as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7983.099999999999)|
| 2:13:07| And KPD also collects data on their end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7987.58)|
| 2:13:11| And then you would need assistance from 9-1-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7991.62)|
| 2:13:14| 9-8-8, all of these sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7994.9800000000005)|
| 2:13:17| All of the points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7997.740000000001)|
| 2:13:19| I mean, I think that we have to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7999.46)|
| 2:13:21| all of the points where individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8001.22)|
| 2:13:24| are intercepting into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8004.3)|
| 2:13:29| And then somehow we're gonna have to talk to providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8009.34)|
| 2:13:32| who are serving individuals who can give us the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8012.620000000001)|
| 2:13:37| on the numbers of individuals who are afraid to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8017.540000000001)|
| 2:13:40| and would utilize a different service level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8020.780000000001)|
| 2:13:43| Because I think that's something that's hard to capture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8023.38)|
| 2:13:46| but it's very real out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8026.74)|
| 2:13:48| So I think we've got to talk to the other providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8028.14)|
| 2:13:50| in the community on how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8030.26)|
| 2:13:52| Would you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8032.38)|
| 2:13:54| Yeah, and I would just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8034.06)|
| 2:13:55| I think we're all in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8035.54)|
| 2:13:57| that alternative response is a need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8037.14)|
| 2:13:59| Maybe I'm overstating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8039.86)|
| 2:14:01| Maybe I'm hopeful in saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8041.5)|
| 2:14:03| But I think there is an urgency here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8043.1)|
| 2:14:05| Like the longer we wait to implement alternative response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8045.3)|
| 2:14:08| the more time we have to have negative outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8048.74)|
| 2:14:11| So I don't, I'm worried that this is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8051.9400000000005)|
| 2:14:14| like a very extensive, like slow time of data collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8054.660000000001)|
| 2:14:18| And should we do this and how do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8058.38)|
| 2:14:20| And this is why I think a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8060.34)|
| 2:14:22| of getting everyone in the room and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8062.42)|
| 2:14:24| okay, here are all these community providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8064.14)|
| 2:14:26| We have so many smaller mental health agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8066.660000000001)|
| 2:14:28| like the one I work at that like are not in the room often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8068.9400000000005)|
| 2:14:32| but have incredible information and data as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8072.740000000001)|
| 2:14:35| So like, this is why I hope we can work with some urgency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8075.540000000001)|
| 2:14:38| to say like, let's agree that alternative response is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8078.9400000000005)|
| 2:14:43| and like, let's take the next step to make it happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8083.740000000001)|
| 2:14:45| and let's create a timeline to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8085.820000000001)|
| 2:14:48| I agree with the urgency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8088.38)|
| 2:14:49| but I also see this as we're just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8089.700000000001)|
| 2:14:51| we're beginning some foundational things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8091.620000000001)|
| 2:14:54| that it's going to continue for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8094.02)|
| 2:14:57| 911 started in 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8097.26)|
| 2:15:00| So, you know, 50 years ago that started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8100.06)|
| 2:15:03| 988 started last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8103.06)|
| 2:15:05| So it's going to take some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8105.18)|
| 2:15:06| to build up all of our systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8106.500000000001)|
| 2:15:08| And I want us to be able to do it correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8108.22)|
| 2:15:10| and what the society needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8110.34)|
| 2:15:11| There are a lot of different crisis models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8111.740000000001)|
| 2:15:13| There are some where after the police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8113.42)|
| 2:15:16| have gone to the same place 10 times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8116.18)|
| 2:15:18| then they start sending out crisis response teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8118.06)|
| 2:15:22| I mean, there are many different ways of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8122.740000000001)|
| 2:15:24| So I guess I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8124.38)|
| 2:15:25| that we're doing it community specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8125.58)|
| 2:15:27| with all of the partners involved with data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8127.26)|
| 2:15:31| and buying into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8131.18)|
| 2:15:33| So I'm not trying to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8133.34)|
| 2:15:34| I don't want to have another five years of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8134.3)|
| 2:15:36| but we might need to have a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8136.74)|
| 2:15:38| maybe a year worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8138.54)|
| 2:15:40| This meeting is not about making any decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8140.58)|
| 2:15:42| but if it were up to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8142.78)|
| 2:15:44| I would start trying to fund somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8144.54)|
| 2:15:46| to do the data collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8146.179999999999)|
| 2:15:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8148.78)|
| 2:15:49| I was going to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8149.62)|
| 2:15:50| I'm going to have to interrupt just real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8150.46)|
| 2:15:52| because the time has expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8152.26)|
| 2:15:53| but I do have other folks on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8153.7)|
| 2:15:58| but good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8158.139999999999)|
| 2:15:59| So I wanted to let that go for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8159.3)|
| 2:16:02| The one thing I would add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8162.62)|
| 2:16:05| is I think we did hear from Mr. Anders about E911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8165.02)|
| 2:16:10| and he said that they have a lot of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8170.46)|
| 2:16:12| but they haven't mined that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8172.9400000000005)|
| 2:16:15| And it seems to me like that might be a good starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8175.34)|
| 2:16:18| for doing exactly what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8178.700000000001)|
| 2:16:21| Well, and here he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8181.740000000001)|
| 2:16:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8186.580000000001)|
| 2:16:27| So real quick on data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8187.42)|
| 2:16:28| that we have a ton of data points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8188.26)|
| 2:16:30| but when you're looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8190.860000000001)|
| 2:16:31| so if someone calls in and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8191.700000000001)|
| 2:16:33| hey, there's a person walking down the middle of Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8193.14)|
| 2:16:36| with no clothes on yelling at people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8196.38)|
| 2:16:39| that could come in as a disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8199.38)|
| 2:16:40| and not a mental disturbance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8200.779999999999)|
| 2:16:42| So what we have is raw data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8202.14)|
| 2:16:45| When somebody calls in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8205.58)|
| 2:16:46| it may not be what's really going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8206.539999999999)|
| 2:16:48| when there's a responder there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8208.66)|
| 2:16:49| And so there's raw data that we can find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8209.939999999999)|
| 2:16:53| that may or may not be sufficient for what you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8213.18)|
| 2:16:57| but there's also what the outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8217.5)|
| 2:16:59| of the response is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8219.699999999999)|
| 2:17:01| So it could come in as a party call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8221.94)|
| 2:17:05| and it's a domestic disturbance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8225.18)|
| 2:17:06| So we never get that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8226.7)|
| 2:17:09| We only know that they made a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8229.1)|
| 2:17:10| We don't know what that report is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8230.42)|
| 2:17:11| So our data, we can find you some data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8231.7)|
| 2:17:15| but we want to make sure it's pertinent data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8235.220000000001)|
| 2:17:16| We don't know what we're looking for right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8236.74)|
| 2:17:18| but we're more than willing to look at all of our data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8238.34)|
| 2:17:22| That's public records, especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8242.140000000001)|
| 2:17:23| So that might be a way that our group could work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8243.74)|
| 2:17:28| to help bring about that kind of a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8248.060000000001)|
| 2:17:32| We could have somebody look at the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8252.54)|
| 2:17:34| and then let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8254.18)|
| 2:17:35| I mean, can you give us a sense for real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8255.380000000001)|
| 2:17:38| what the number of calls you get for E911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8258.380000000001)|
| 2:17:42| are in Knox County in a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8262.34)|
| 2:17:43| and how many of those are non-emergency calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8263.78)|
| 2:17:46| So we answer approximately around 580,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8266.1)|
| 2:17:49| almost 600,000 calls a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8269.94)|
| 2:17:51| Some of, a little over half of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8271.54)|
| 2:17:54| generally trend toward non-emergency to 10-digit lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8274.060000000001)|
| 2:17:58| E911 lines account for a little bit less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8278.820000000002)|
| 2:18:01| than half of our calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8281.86)|
| 2:18:03| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8283.900000000001)|
| 2:18:04| And each agency, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8284.94)|
| 2:18:06| each agency has various 10-digit lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8286.66)|
| 2:18:09| that come into us, animal control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8289.42)|
| 2:18:11| police has a non-emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8291.5)|
| 2:18:12| sheriff has a non-emergency, fire has a non-emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8292.7)|
| 2:18:14| All those, fire may not have one that comes directly to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8294.900000000001)|
| 2:18:18| but most agencies do have a 10-digit that comes to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8298.66)|
| 2:18:22| and we also provide that service and answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8302.220000000001)|
| 2:18:24| And some of those may be going through 311 as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8304.820000000002)|
| 2:18:28| that may go from 311 straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8308.02)|
| 2:18:29| to the police department co-response unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8309.820000000002)|
| 2:18:31| and we may never see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8311.34)|
| 2:18:32| So there's a ton of data out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8312.86)|
| 2:18:34| It's just a matter of what do you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8314.740000000002)|
| 2:18:36| and how do you want to get the finality of the response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8316.580000000002)|
| 2:18:39| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8319.94)|
| 2:18:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8321.02)|
| 2:18:42| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8322.1)|
| 2:18:45| Yeah, I want to thank everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8325.740000000002)|
| 2:18:47| that was able to be here and present information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8327.94)|
| 2:18:50| I know we've all done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8330.420000000002)|
| 2:18:54| This is literally not even the tip of the iceberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8334.220000000001)|
| 2:18:56| So I think that's what the big challenge is for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8336.62)|
| 2:18:58| is that this has been so broad and so much information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8338.94)|
| 2:19:01| but yet not even like the sprinkles on the cupcake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8341.380000000001)|
| 2:19:04| There's no way we can cover it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8344.380000000001)|
| 2:19:06| So that in itself is kind of frustrating too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8346.140000000001)|
| 2:19:09| because we could honestly spend days talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8349.18)|
| 2:19:11| all of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8351.78)|
| 2:19:12| And I know everyone up here, if we all won the lottery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8352.900000000001)|
| 2:19:15| we would spend all our money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8355.820000000002)|
| 2:19:16| trying to solve all of our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8356.820000000002)|
| 2:19:18| But that's the thing is that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8358.26)|
| 2:19:20| that's not the issue that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8360.900000000001)|
| 2:19:24| It's like we have very limited time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8364.86)|
| 2:19:27| and how do I use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8367.02)|
| 2:19:27| So I'm going to launch off of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8367.86)|
| 2:19:28| that Councilwoman Singh started with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8368.94)|
| 2:19:31| I think, you know, there's some comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8371.82)|
| 2:19:34| and we can talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8374.34)|
| 2:19:35| we have all these inmates who have mental health illnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8375.86)|
| 2:19:40| and they end up in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8380.74)|
| 2:19:42| and maybe that's not where they belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8382.5)|
| 2:19:44| And I think part of the issue that we started with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8384.62)|
| 2:19:47| is how do we avoid that circumstance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8387.34)|
| 2:19:50| Or how do we avoid the circumstance of a suicide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8390.5)|
| 2:19:53| Or I've had three incidences in one neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8393.58)|
| 2:19:58| within just over 24 hours in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8398.86)|
| 2:20:02| in the past day-ish plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8402.46)|
| 2:20:05| One was a drug deal gone wrong and there was a shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8405.3)|
| 2:20:09| One was a death on the sidewalk from a drug overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8409.06)|
| 2:20:13| And the other, I've been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8413.06)|
| 2:20:14| I don't know too much about it, is a murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8414.38)|
| 2:20:17| And I'm not sure, but we could conjecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8417.1)|
| 2:20:19| that maybe there was some crisis going on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8419.42)|
| 2:20:22| that led to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8422.18)|
| 2:20:23| Who knows, maybe a drug deal, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8423.46)|
| 2:20:26| So there's a lot of needs in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8426.699999999999)|
| 2:20:28| and this ties up our police and it ties up our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8428.3)|
| 2:20:32| People lose their lives, people lose their friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8432.06)|
| 2:20:34| their family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8434.22)|
| 2:20:35| and then the community members around them feel endangered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8435.26)|
| 2:20:38| So I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8438.539999999999)|
| 2:20:40| we've talked about 50,000 problems here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8440.3)|
| 2:20:42| and it's like, how do we talk about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8442.58)|
| 2:20:45| that we could actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8445.26)|
| 2:20:46| have an ask about to walk away with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8446.46)|
| 2:20:49| And I think where we started is Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8449.039999999999)|
| 2:20:51| and how we ended up coming to the table again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8451.019999999999)|
| 2:20:53| with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8453.779999999999)|
| 2:20:54| is we have things that go on in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8454.619999999999)|
| 2:20:57| that maybe we could have additional response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8457.02)|
| 2:21:01| and try to intercept things before the crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8461.859999999999)|
| 2:21:05| or whatever happened ended them up into the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8465.66)|
| 2:21:08| And I don't take away from the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8468.98)|
| 2:21:10| that that's really, really a terrible reflection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8470.779999999999)|
| 2:21:13| of our society that we have a bunch of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8473.58)|
| 2:21:15| with mental illnesses that are in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8475.18)|
| 2:21:17| instead of in some kind of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8477.74)|
| 2:21:19| But how do we maybe intercept some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8479.859999999999)|
| 2:21:21| before it gets to that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8481.78)|
| 2:21:24| So I think my question to you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8484.78)|
| 2:21:27| because I'm going to run out of time here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8487.820000000002)|
| 2:21:29| is we've talked a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8489.380000000001)|
| 2:21:31| about how you start and data collection and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8491.900000000001)|
| 2:21:34| I'm going to ask you to talk about mobile crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8494.34)|
| 2:21:37| because I feel like that's kind of a service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8497.1)|
| 2:21:38| that we have that exists that could morph or go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8498.78)|
| 2:21:43| I feel like the name of mobile crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8503.34)|
| 2:21:46| started as to be mobile crisis, go out and respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8506.460000000001)|
| 2:21:49| but yet it never has been able to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8509.6)|
| 2:21:52| And it's both people can call in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8512.800000000001)|
| 2:21:54| as well as providers can ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8514.640000000001)|
| 2:21:57| So tell me if I'm right or wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8517.0)|
| 2:21:59| is that some direction that we could kind of build upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8519.48)|
| 2:22:03| or expand upon how that might respond to, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8523.640000000001)|
| 2:22:09| the 85 almost thousand Knox Countians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8529.24)|
| 2:22:12| with a substance use disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8532.48)|
| 2:22:14| or the people in crisis that are trying to use mobile crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8534.12)|
| 2:22:19| Leanne, I threw a giant one at you, so maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8539.0)|
| 2:22:21| I'm going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8541.64)|
| 2:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8542.56)|
| 2:22:23| I'm going to try to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8543.4)|
| 2:22:24| I don't know where to go in three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8544.24)|
| 2:22:25| Well, okay, I'm going to try to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8545.6)|
| 2:22:27| and I'm going to ask your help on that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8547.12)|
| 2:22:29| A couple of things came to my mind as you were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8549.28)|
| 2:22:32| One is, I think we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8552.32)|
| 2:22:34| about a very broad target population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8554.72)|
| 2:22:38| So it's hard for me to answer what's the best intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8558.56)|
| 2:22:43| when we're talking about individuals, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8563.06)|
| 2:22:47| that need food assistance, transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8567.56)|
| 2:22:52| to individuals who are having a domestic violent incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8572.84)|
| 2:22:58| on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8578.4)|
| 2:22:59| that might be substance use disorder related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8579.24)|
| 2:23:01| who also might have a mental health situation going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8581.08)|
| 2:23:04| So all of those interventions in my mind are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8584.56)|
| 2:23:10| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8590.279999999999)|
| 2:23:11| So the intervention I would do on one end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8591.119999999999)|
| 2:23:13| would not be the intervention I would do on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8593.6)|
| 2:23:16| And I think what's the challenge here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8596.24)|
| 2:23:18| is how do we know what is happening in real time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8598.039999999999)|
| 2:23:21| and can we really get information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8601.36)|
| 2:23:24| so that we can best send the most appropriate response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8604.52)|
| 2:23:28| to those individuals, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8608.84)|
| 2:23:30| I think that's what we're all, all of us are trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8610.68)|
| 2:23:34| So I think that's a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8614.88)|
| 2:23:35| and I think that's where the data comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8615.96)|
| 2:23:38| I also think that to answer kind of mobile crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8618.44)|
| 2:23:41| could we shore up mobile crisis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8621.88)|
| 2:23:43| I do think that there is a lot of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8623.16)|
| 2:23:45| that we could talk about shoring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8625.52)|
| 2:23:47| Right now, the team is answering 11 counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8627.52)|
| 2:23:51| and they are doing over 30 calls a day and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8631.640000000001)|
| 2:23:56| you know, I think the last time I checked was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8636.68)|
| 2:23:59| if you look at all the counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8639.44)|
| 2:24:00| it's almost close to 20 full psychiatric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8640.84)|
| 2:24:05| inpatient assessments per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8645.28)|
| 2:24:08| So could they also be a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8648.16)|
| 2:24:11| that could respond into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8651.2)|
| 2:24:13| if it looked a little different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8653.560000000001)|
| 2:24:14| if it wasn't one person, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8654.84)|
| 2:24:16| if it was more than one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8656.92)|
| 2:24:18| or could they go with a different support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8658.72)|
| 2:24:20| I mean, I think there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8660.52)|
| 2:24:21| I don't think there's any reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8661.8)|
| 2:24:24| we couldn't look at all the models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8664.0)|
| 2:24:25| and I think that's a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8665.16)|
| 2:24:29| So, I mean, I think there's a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8669.52)|
| 2:24:31| but I don't know that it would solve all of the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8671.44)|
| 2:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8675.28)|
| 2:24:36| My time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8676.68)|
| 2:24:39| Well, you can ask to come back and we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8679.44)|
| 2:24:43| Thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8683.92)|
| 2:24:45| The thing I was gonna mention in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8685.24)|
| 2:24:46| that sounds very much so to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8686.64)|
| 2:24:48| like something we've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8688.24)|
| 2:24:50| we've obviously councils talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8690.68)|
| 2:24:52| but then there's been discussion about it this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8692.64)|
| 2:24:55| but maybe that's something where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8695.36)|
| 2:24:58| we could ask our state partners for some help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8698.48)|
| 2:25:01| with maybe a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8701.16)|
| 2:25:02| They could look at something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8702.68)|
| 2:25:05| to have a rapid mobile response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8705.36)|
| 2:25:07| for people that are dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8707.68)|
| 2:25:08| with untreated mental health crises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8708.8)|
| 2:25:11| which would go very much so in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8711.84)|
| 2:25:14| with what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8714.28)|
| 2:25:15| with alternative response as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8715.12)|
| 2:25:16| So maybe there is some avenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8716.56)|
| 2:25:18| that we've talked about today about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8718.12)|
| 2:25:20| looking at data from 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8720.880000000001)|
| 2:25:23| but also maybe there's opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8723.04)|
| 2:25:24| for some kind of a pilot program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8724.48)|
| 2:25:27| I saw Commissioner Frazier had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8727.84)|
| 2:25:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8733.640000000001)|

| 2:25:41| or you are a healthcare provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8741.12)|

| 2:25:47| I don't even really feel worthy of asking any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8747.04)|
| 2:25:50| or sharing a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8750.36)|
| 2:25:53| But I wanna talk about our kids for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8753.92)|
| 2:25:58| The fact that we are now assessing mental health data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8758.640000000001)|
| 2:26:02| starting at the age of nine years old is really disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8762.6)|
| 2:26:08| I serve on the advisory council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8768.36)|
| 2:26:09| at my children's school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8769.92)|
| 2:26:11| And one thing I constantly hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8771.92)|
| 2:26:13| from our guidance counselors are the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8773.56)|
| 2:26:17| for more behavioral health services in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8777.88)|
| 2:26:25| There are long waiting lists, a lack of providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8785.28)|
| 2:26:30| And constantly I'm asking the question at those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8790.960000000001)|
| 2:26:35| well, what are we doing about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8795.2)|
| 2:26:37| I know staffing is an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8797.2)|
| 2:26:38| but what are you doing about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8798.880000000001)|
| 2:26:42| Because I don't have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8802.16)|
| 2:26:46| And our kids are struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8806.76)|
| 2:26:48| I mean, I find it very disturbing too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8808.28)|
| 2:26:51| that our schools are now teaching other students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8811.56)|
| 2:26:56| how to identify a mental health issue in their peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8816.36)|
| 2:27:01| And that's concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8821.8)|
| 2:27:06| I mean, that's an additional layer of stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8826.04)|
| 2:27:09| that is unnecessary on our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8829.2)|
| 2:27:11| They're already stressed enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8831.44)|
| 2:27:12| I mean, this is a broken world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8832.68)|
| 2:27:14| and they're just trying to get an education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8834.28)|
| 2:27:17| and get through the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8837.28)|
| 2:27:21| And I just, I feel like we need to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8841.12)|
| 2:27:23| And if you can enlighten me in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8843.32)|
| 2:27:27| Council Member Frazier, we absolutely agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8847.76)|
| 2:27:30| I mean, McNabb has provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8850.04)|
| 2:27:34| embedded mental health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8854.08)|
| 2:27:36| in the school system for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8856.6)|
| 2:27:40| It's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8860.68)|
| 2:27:42| And we really have been talking internally about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8862.32)|
| 2:27:45| we need to, and I think the Department of Mental Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8865.12)|
| 2:27:47| has really dedicated resources and funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8867.88)|
| 2:27:50| to expand that across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8870.92)|
| 2:27:53| So we're very excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8873.12)|
| 2:27:55| But we really need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8875.28)|
| 2:27:56| that children don't have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8876.96)|
| 2:27:58| and that we are where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8878.64)|
| 2:28:01| so that there's no barrier for them or their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8881.72)|
| 2:28:04| And then we need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8884.76)|
| 2:28:06| that we take the services into the home as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8886.16)|
| 2:28:10| We wanna make sure that the family, the parents, the child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8890.48)|
| 2:28:14| the providers are all on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8894.72)|
| 2:28:16| addressing whatever needs they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8896.6)|
| 2:28:18| for that child and family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8898.48)|
| 2:28:20| So we are absolutely on board with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8900.64)|
| 2:28:23| and ready to expand whenever we are given the go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8903.32)|
| 2:28:28| I'm sorry, I was just gonna add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8908.16)|
| 2:28:32| This is a particular interest for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8912.56)|
| 2:28:34| just because I have a 12-year-old daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8914.64)|
| 2:28:36| and it's top of mind daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8916.6)|
| 2:28:39| My background's also in children's mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8919.04)|
| 2:28:41| I would say, as Leanne mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8921.48)|
| 2:28:44| the governor has really focused on children's mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8924.8)|
| 2:28:47| since he took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8927.8)|
| 2:28:49| Most recently, our department was funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8929.84)|
| 2:28:51| to expand our school-based behavioral health liaison program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8931.84)|
| 2:28:55| So beginning this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8935.56)|
| 2:28:57| I think there's close to nine positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8937.8)|
| 2:28:59| that our department's funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8939.56)|
| 2:29:00| to be school-based behavioral health liaisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8940.72)|
| 2:29:03| I mean, it's really no different than the adult system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8943.76)|
| 2:29:06| You have to go where people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8946.199999999999)|
| 2:29:08| to ensure that they have access to care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8948.439999999999)|
| 2:29:10| And I think for kids, they're in school most of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8950.88)|
| 2:29:15| So the more that we can educate teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8955.279999999999)|
| 2:29:18| on how to identify signs and symptoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8958.119999999999)|
| 2:29:20| but also give them a resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8960.16)|
| 2:29:21| so they can focus on teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8961.6)|
| 2:29:23| and they can connect that family to a school-based liaison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8963.64)|
| 2:29:27| the better that child will be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8967.56)|
| 2:29:28| The other program that I'll mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8968.88)|
| 2:29:30| because I talked earlier about our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8970.199999999999)|
| 2:29:31| being the safety net for uninsured Tennesseans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8971.84)|
| 2:29:36| there's still an estimated 4% to 5% kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8976.16)|
| 2:29:39| in our state who are uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8979.039999999999)|
| 2:29:41| Governor Lee helped create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8981.119999999999)|
| 2:29:42| a children's behavioral health safety net| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8982.16)|
| 2:29:44| to serve those uninsured kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8984.6)|
| 2:29:46| in communities across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8986.72)|
| 2:29:47| that have mental health needs in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8987.96)|
| 2:29:50| So I would say that there is a growing need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8990.12)|
| 2:29:54| but I feel pretty strongly that the state's responding to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8994.800000000001)|
| 2:29:57| We've got a long way to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8997.28)|
| 2:29:58| just because the prevalence of mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8998.400000000001)|
| 2:30:00| among kids continues to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9000.880000000001)|
| 2:30:03| But I think going to where kids naturally are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9003.560000000001)|
| 2:30:07| the school setting, makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9007.04)|
| 2:30:10| That is encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9010.0)|
| 2:30:12| You know, as I said, we've got multiple schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9012.12)|
| 2:30:16| sharing one behavioral health specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9016.12)|
| 2:30:20| That's just not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9020.880000000001)|
| 2:30:23| Not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9023.560000000001)|
| 2:30:24| I'm Mona Blankenship, and I'm the CEO of the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9024.400000000001)|
| 2:30:27| And I just want to respond to exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9027.400000000001)|
| 2:30:29| what you've heard Leanne and Matt say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9029.68)|
| 2:30:33| But what I want you all to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9033.640000000001)|
| 2:30:35| is that Knox County has been ahead of the ballgame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9035.2)|
| 2:30:37| and that we have had school-based services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9037.68)|
| 2:30:40| in Knox County since 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9040.2)|
| 2:30:43| And Knox County has really stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9043.84)|
| 2:30:47| And the commissioner, Commissioner Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9047.16)|
| 2:30:51| Nancy Thornton, that are all here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9051.44)|
| 2:30:53| they are very much supportive of school-based services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9053.96)|
| 2:30:56| But this is the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9056.92)|
| 2:30:58| This, you know, we're going to have a special session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9058.36)|
| 2:31:01| in August 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9061.039999999999)|
| 2:31:02| The answer is having behavioral health services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9062.48)|
| 2:31:04| in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9064.96)|
| 2:31:06| And we need to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9066.32)|
| 2:31:07| That's how we prevent the violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9067.64)|
| 2:31:09| that we've seen in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9069.6)|
| 2:31:11| And so again, I wanted to make sure that everybody heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9071.16)|
| 2:31:14| that Knox County is ahead of the ballgame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9074.84)|
| 2:31:17| in that area, and we do have a way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9077.560000000001)|
| 2:31:20| If I might also add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9080.6)|
| 2:31:22| yeah, there are four stages of mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9082.52)|
| 2:31:26| The earliest stage is when symptoms first onset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9086.320000000002)|
| 2:31:30| and they're fairly mild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9090.84)|
| 2:31:32| And that's where we should be trying to reach young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9092.320000000002)|
| 2:31:36| when those symptoms are first onsetting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9096.160000000002)|
| 2:31:38| because otherwise, a young person will experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9098.080000000002)|
| 2:31:41| a decade or more of treatment delay before they get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9101.2)|
| 2:31:44| That means they will be a young adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9104.44)|
| 2:31:47| well on their way to a life of impairment and disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9107.12)|
| 2:31:50| if we have not recognized and intervened early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9110.28)|
| 2:31:53| That's why interventions at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9113.44)|

| 2:32:03| is vitally important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9123.2)|
| 2:32:04| It's also why the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9124.44)|
| 2:32:07| has been a partner with the Mental Health Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9127.52)|
| 2:32:11| delivering mental health education in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9131.44)|
| 2:32:14| since fall of 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9134.6)|
| 2:32:16| We do that in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9136.52)|
| 2:32:18| or in the school's health curriculum at middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9138.24)|

| 2:32:26| And the reason is to help young people recognize early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9146.640000000001)|
| 2:32:30| the symptoms in their peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9150.720000000001)|
| 2:32:33| If they recognize it in their brothers and sisters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9153.32)|
| 2:32:35| that's great too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9155.560000000001)|
| 2:32:36| Sometimes those kiddos come back to us and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9156.92)|
| 2:32:39| oh, it's my mom and dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9159.84)|
| 2:32:41| But it doesn't matter who they're recognizing it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9161.4)|
| 2:32:44| It then becomes, okay, what are you gonna do about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9164.56)|
| 2:32:47| How long have those symptoms been present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9167.24)|
| 2:32:49| Is it two weeks or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9169.92)|
| 2:32:51| Or is it an urgent situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9171.68)|
| 2:32:53| like someone's dealing with psychosis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9173.48)|
| 2:32:55| You're not waiting two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9175.52)|
| 2:32:56| If it's suicidality, we're not waiting two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9176.880000000001)|
| 2:32:59| We are teaching kids they've got to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9179.76)|
| 2:33:02| And they act by going to their trusted adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9182.48)|
| 2:33:05| in their school, in their family, in their church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9185.4)|
| 2:33:09| to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9189.28)|
| 2:33:10| And that's the vital part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9190.44)|
| 2:33:11| of mental health education in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9191.960000000001)|
| 2:33:14| Let's dial up the intervention early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9194.480000000001)|
| 2:33:16| so we have fewer people that we're intervening with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9196.68)|
| 2:33:20| at stage four, which is where we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9200.0)|
| 2:33:23| crisis services, law enforcement, hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9203.24)|
| 2:33:26| and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9206.0)|
| 2:33:27| We wanna go upstream, stage one and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9207.04)|
| 2:33:30| catch people earlier where it's easier to treat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9210.84)|
| 2:33:33| Thank you for your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9213.84)|
| 2:33:35| Yeah, and that's really where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9215.0)|
| 2:33:38| We talk about our kids need more career exploration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9218.2)|
| 2:33:41| early on, and I feel like it's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9221.92)|
| 2:33:44| as far as making sure that they're happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9224.16)|
| 2:33:48| and they're joyful and they can be kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9228.76)|
| 2:33:51| And so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9231.72)|

| 2:34:00| I wanna just affirm what Mona just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9240.92)|
| 2:34:03| Every principal I speak to talks about the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9243.76)|
| 2:34:06| of that resource in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9246.28)|
| 2:34:08| It is a really big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9248.08)|
| 2:34:09| I'm actually really encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9249.72)|
| 2:34:10| because we have two bodies left here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9250.76)|
| 2:34:13| and I feel like there's a lot of unity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9253.48)|
| 2:34:15| around a couple key things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9255.439999999999)|
| 2:34:17| So as a community, I think we should all be proud around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9257.0)|
| 2:34:20| I think there's a couple things we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9260.76)|
| 2:34:22| to act out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9262.84)|
| 2:34:24| I wanna thank everybody, the local service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9264.119999999999)|
| 2:34:26| and thank you, thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9266.64)|
| 2:34:29| I'm also happy to say I agree with everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9269.16)|
| 2:34:31| that's been said before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9271.16)|
| 2:34:32| So I think that speaks to where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9272.16)|
| 2:34:35| I have a question for our friends from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9275.880000000001)|
| 2:34:38| Mr. Yancy and Mr. Thornton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9278.240000000002)|
| 2:34:39| I'm more familiar with the local programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9279.6)|
| 2:34:41| and the new emerging programs and the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9281.52)|
| 2:34:43| but I do remember last year the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9283.36)|
| 2:34:47| in workers for mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9287.800000000001)|
| 2:34:51| And I think Mr. Harrington made a compelling case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9291.160000000002)|
| 2:34:53| for how to incentivize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9293.880000000001)|
| 2:34:57| And I believe the commissioner last year stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9297.04)|
| 2:35:00| that last year she applied for specific funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9300.68)|
| 2:35:05| to increase higher education incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9305.560000000001)|
| 2:35:08| as outlined by Mr. Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9308.28)|
| 2:35:09| I believe she made that appeal again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9309.640000000001)|
| 2:35:11| I just wanted to confirm whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9311.6)|
| 2:35:13| was that approved as part of this recent budget or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9313.560000000001)|
| 2:35:19| So that element of our budget request was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9319.52)|
| 2:35:22| However, what was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9322.76)|
| 2:35:24| was the aforementioned provider rate increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9324.0)|
| 2:35:28| So I think the approach that the state's looking to take is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9328.04)|
| 2:35:32| because you gotta think about it from a recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9332.44)|
| 2:35:34| and a retention standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9334.12)|
| 2:35:35| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9335.560000000001)|
| 2:35:36| And so I think for this year, last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9336.400000000001)|
| 2:35:39| we're really trying to focus up and shore up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9339.6)|
| 2:35:41| the current workforce with provider rate increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9341.240000000002)|
| 2:35:44| That being said, we have other funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9344.720000000001)|
| 2:35:47| that we've been able to secure through other grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9347.480000000001)|
| 2:35:49| where we're partnering with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9349.320000000002)|
| 2:35:50| we're actually partnering with the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9350.92)|
| 2:35:53| a school of social work, college of social work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9353.160000000002)|
| 2:35:55| where they're actually going into high schools to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9355.28)|
| 2:35:58| like as Ben was saying, to educate high school students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9358.160000000002)|
| 2:36:00| about careers in behavioral health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9360.880000000001)|
| 2:36:03| I do think we're gonna continue to advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9363.2)|
| 2:36:06| for the idea that we can provide college stipends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9366.320000000002)|
| 2:36:09| to people who want to advance their degrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9369.720000000001)|
| 2:36:11| in a behavioral health field with that expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9371.400000000001)|
| 2:36:14| that they work for agencies like Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9374.2)|
| 2:36:16| like McNabb post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9376.52)|
| 2:36:18| So we're not gonna lose sight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9378.68)|
| 2:36:20| Okay, please don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9380.640000000001)|
| 2:36:21| And we'll help you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9381.560000000001)|
| 2:36:22| Because I think as part of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9382.480000000001)|
| 2:36:24| Governor Lee appropriated funds to recruit police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9384.16)|
| 2:36:27| And I think the irony that those police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9387.880000000001)|
| 2:36:32| and mental health workers are both short-staffed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9392.56)|
| 2:36:35| and need more compensation and are in great need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9395.68)|
| 2:36:39| and one was funded and the other was not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9399.039999999999)|
| 2:36:41| I think is another reason for us to keep advocating for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9401.76)|
| 2:36:45| So thank you for confirming that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9405.6)|

| 2:36:54| you know, it seems like the admissions are going down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9414.359999999999)|
| 2:36:56| but the beds are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9416.8)|
| 2:36:57| And I, you know, I don't, I do applaud the innovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9417.96)|
| 2:37:01| that you've taken at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9421.28)|
| 2:37:02| My read on the street here and my eyewitness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9422.800000000001)|
| 2:37:06| isn't that we're being more successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9426.16)|
| 2:37:08| at solving the problem here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9428.0)|
| 2:37:10| But I do wanna applaud you listening to the innovative ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9430.76)|
| 2:37:15| of the local service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9435.92)|
| 2:37:17| because I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9437.400000000001)|
| 2:37:19| The children's CSU, the empath, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9439.16)|
| 2:37:22| that whether that started at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9442.92)|
| 2:37:24| or started at a local level, there's, everyone's listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9444.560000000001)|
| 2:37:27| And I think you can hear the most acute needs locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9447.320000000002)|
| 2:37:30| by listening to these voices and new voices at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9450.2)|
| 2:37:33| So I commend you for listening to those and meeting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9453.76)|
| 2:37:37| and to keep Knox County innovative in this realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9457.12)|
| 2:37:40| So thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9460.640000000001)|
| 2:37:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9462.92)|
| 2:37:43| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9463.76)|
| 2:37:45| Yes, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9465.240000000002)|
| 2:37:46| We talked about available beds and when we have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9466.880000000001)|
| 2:37:51| could someone talk a little bit about how we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9471.08)|
| 2:37:53| as far as outreach when we do have available beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9473.400000000001)|
| 2:37:58| finding the people who need them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9478.12)|
| 2:38:01| and getting them into those beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9481.0)|
| 2:38:06| Do you mean recipients or who might need them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9486.08)|
| 2:38:09| I'm mainly talking about homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9489.36)|
| 2:38:11| Like if you have available beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9491.44)|
| 2:38:14| and there might be a psychiatric need for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9494.240000000002)|
| 2:38:18| I know that we have a staffing problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9498.160000000002)|
| 2:38:20| but when we do have those beds that are open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9500.800000000001)|
| 2:38:24| what is the mechanism for finding people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9504.36)|
| 2:38:28| that are mentally ill on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9508.32)|
| 2:38:30| and getting them in those beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9510.439999999999)|
| 2:38:32| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9512.16)|
| 2:38:33| I'm gonna answer it a couple of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9513.16)|
| 2:38:34| And Candice, you have not talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9514.32)|
| 2:38:35| so I want you to feel like you can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9515.76)|
| 2:38:38| So I would like to say individuals who are admitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9518.24)|
| 2:38:44| into an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9524.199999999999)|
| 2:38:47| have to meet criteria for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9527.16)|
| 2:38:49| They have to have a plan to harm themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9529.519999999999)|
| 2:38:53| or someone else, means, intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9533.88)|
| 2:38:57| all those things kind of have to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9537.08)|
| 2:38:59| So when you think about it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9539.44)|
| 2:39:00| it's not sometimes that easy and shouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9540.92)|
| 2:39:04| to get into that level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9544.8)|
| 2:39:06| Would y'all agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9546.08)|
| 2:39:06| Okay, so an individual can be homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9546.92)|
| 2:39:13| and have a mental illness and not meet eligibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9553.0)|
| 2:39:17| And what we know is there's not enough housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9557.64)|
| 2:39:21| in our community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9561.8)|
| 2:39:24| And I think while we have a lot of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9564.279999999999)|
| 2:39:27| that try to reach that population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9567.88)|
| 2:39:31| it is difficult and challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9571.0)|
| 2:39:32| and there's not enough services in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9572.6)|
| 2:39:36| I mean, please respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9576.24)|
| 2:39:37| No, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9577.72)|
| 2:39:38| I just wanna say like all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9578.56)|
| 2:39:40| I absolutely love the talk of like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9580.44)|
| 2:39:42| we need more beds for mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9582.359999999999)|
| 2:39:44| but I wanna make sure we're not using that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9584.8)|
| 2:39:47| as a way to basically imprison or institutionalize people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9587.199999999999)|
| 2:39:52| About a third of my clients experience psychosis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9592.24)|
| 2:39:55| about a third also have sometimes chronic suicidality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9595.16)|
| 2:39:58| about 70% have PTSD, many are houseless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9598.64)|
| 2:40:01| They don't need to be in a psychiatric institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9601.8)|
| 2:40:07| because they're not meeting those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9607.2)|
| 2:40:09| What they need is secure housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9609.039999999999)|
| 2:40:11| they need more case management services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9611.32)|
| 2:40:13| they need more money, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9613.8)|
| 2:40:15| Like, can you live off $800 disability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9615.92)|
| 2:40:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9619.08)|
| 2:40:20| So I think like, we don't wanna use hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9620.12)|
| 2:40:23| and needing more hospital beds as a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9623.52)|
| 2:40:26| to take away from the fact that we need systemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9626.12)|
| 2:40:28| like increase in services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9628.480000000001)|
| 2:40:30| that's gonna keep people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9630.320000000002)|
| 2:40:33| So I would also just follow up by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9633.240000000002)|
| 2:40:35| permanent supportive housing with different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9635.640000000001)|
| 2:40:39| So where you have intent, where you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9639.320000000002)|
| 2:40:41| for some individuals may need more in-house support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9641.560000000001)|
| 2:40:45| than just maybe just an independent living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9645.2)|
| 2:40:47| So I think there's different levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9647.880000000001)|
| 2:40:49| that we could look at in Knox County and expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9649.76)|
| 2:40:51| I think there's probably some shortage in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9651.56)|
| 2:40:55| I was gonna add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9655.52)|
| 2:40:57| One of the criteria, the legal statutory criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9657.92)|
| 2:41:02| for emergency involuntary admission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9662.64)|
| 2:41:05| to an inpatient psychiatric hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9665.24)|
| 2:41:09| the criteria is found under Title 33, Chapter 6, Part 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9669.64)|
| 2:41:14| But one of those would be that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9674.4)|
| 2:41:18| no less drastic or less restrictive alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9678.36)|
| 2:41:22| that is available and suitable to meet the person's needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9682.480000000001)|
| 2:41:25| other than inpatient hospitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9685.92)|
| 2:41:28| So I made the reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9688.36)|
| 2:41:29| whenever I was going through the slides quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9689.960000000001)|
| 2:41:33| that this is the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9693.960000000001)|
| 2:41:38| All other resources have been exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9698.28)|
| 2:41:41| There are no alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9701.36)|
| 2:41:43| That's where we find the regional mental health institutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9703.960000000001)|
| 2:41:48| and the emergency involuntary commitment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9708.08)|
| 2:41:53| Thanks for all your thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9713.08)|
| 2:41:54| I knew that wasn't an easy question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9714.92)|
| 2:41:56| and I do realize that there are hurdles legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9716.72)|
| 2:41:59| and otherwise consensual that you have to take into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9719.64)|
| 2:42:06| There is a bit of, I think, frustration in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9726.52)|
| 2:42:10| where they will see people out on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9730.08)|
| 2:42:12| that are obviously mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9732.08)|
| 2:42:14| and then they hear that there's beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9734.52)|
| 2:42:17| So I appreciate you sharing some of the problems and issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9737.56)|
| 2:42:22| and what you're doing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9742.56)|
| 2:42:24| One other question I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9744.76)|
| 2:42:26| Mr. Harrington, you mentioned some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9746.599999999999)|
| 2:42:29| about a couple of hospitals closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9749.24)|
| 2:42:32| another one might possibly close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9752.72)|
| 2:42:36| that they're losing $150 a day for in-care patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9756.039999999999)|
| 2:42:42| Elaborate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9762.24)|
| 2:42:43| Is that sustainable, and what would it take to fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9763.960000000001)|
| 2:42:48| So the first part of your question was hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9768.24)|
| 2:42:51| that closed because they weren't receiving 10-care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9771.64)|
| 2:42:56| for certain services, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9776.12)|
| 2:42:59| UT Medical Center closed their psych unit in 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9779.08)|
| 2:43:02| Children's Hospital closed their psych unit in 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9782.36)|
| 2:43:06| Baptist Hospital never got 10-care money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9786.04)|
| 2:43:09| So that really was kind of a nail in the coffin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9789.72)|
| 2:43:12| and eventually would lead to their closing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9792.76)|
| 2:43:17| and divisions of that hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9797.92)|
| 2:43:19| their outpatient side, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9799.72)|
| 2:43:21| and then eventually merging with St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9801.28)|
| 2:43:25| The two new private hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9805.08)|
| 2:43:27| they take commercial insurance money, private pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9807.56)|
| 2:43:31| and they take some 10-care patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9811.32)|
| 2:43:34| Their 10-care patient is funded at a rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9814.4)|
| 2:43:38| that's about a loss of $150 per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9818.44)|
| 2:43:42| I don't know the answer to how long that is sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9822.84)|
| 2:43:46| but I will tell you, I have meetings with CEOs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9826.16)|
| 2:43:51| like Mona at McNab and Perinda Catria at Cherokee and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9831.04)|
| 2:43:57| So I hear stuff, and both hospital CEOs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9837.16)|
| 2:44:00| are commiserating over the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9840.800000000001)|
| 2:44:03| that their 10-care reimbursement rate is not sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9843.32)|
| 2:44:07| And so that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9847.840000000002)|
| 2:44:11| I don't know if they'd ever be open-minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9851.000000000002)|
| 2:44:13| to receiving funds from the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9853.560000000001)|
| 2:44:17| for serving the uninsured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9857.080000000002)|
| 2:44:18| but if they were open-minded to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9858.840000000002)|
| 2:44:21| I think that they'd look squarely back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9861.840000000002)|
| 2:44:24| at what they're getting for 10-care and just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9864.68)|
| 2:44:27| it's gotta be sufficient to pay the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9867.12)|
| 2:44:29| We can't lose on every one of those patients we see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9869.04)|
| 2:44:32| And so that's kind of what they're experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9872.52)|
| 2:44:35| They would prefer, I think, to have patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9875.880000000001)|
| 2:44:40| that have a payment source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9880.240000000002)|
| 2:44:42| that's going to be able to make them whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9882.320000000002)|
| 2:44:45| Yeah, because they're a for-profit business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9885.6)|
| 2:44:50| Well, I wonder if the expansion of Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9890.000000000002)|
| 2:44:53| might serve some of those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9893.560000000001)|
| 2:44:56| I don't care what you had to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9896.76)|
| 2:44:58| I just, and I'll only add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9898.44)|
| 2:44:59| our sister state of North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9899.84)|
| 2:45:01| That's a complicated question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9901.720000000001)|
| 2:45:03| It just is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9903.240000000002)|
| 2:45:05| I would tell you that, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9905.04)|
| 2:45:06| if the state had expanded Medicaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9906.960000000001)|
| 2:45:08| there would be more resources coming in on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9908.68)|
| 2:45:12| to support healthcare in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9912.24)|
| 2:45:15| But I would also be remiss if I didn't tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9915.720000000001)|
| 2:45:21| to look at states where they did expand Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9921.720000000001)|
| 2:45:26| and ask the question, are they having similar problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9926.800000000001)|
| 2:45:30| with the behavioral health workforce staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9930.64)|
| 2:45:34| and shortages and staff beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9934.000000000002)|
| 2:45:38| versus total bed licenses, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9938.52)|
| 2:45:42| And I think that you could look at states like New York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9942.52)|
| 2:45:45| and New Jersey and Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9945.76)|
| 2:45:47| They're having some of the same challenges we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9947.76)|
| 2:45:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9950.68)|
| 2:45:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9951.880000000001)|

| 2:45:56| and we're going on a very long meeting, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9956.76)|
| 2:46:00| It's a good discussion, but I do need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9960.84)|
| 2:46:04| Council Member Parker, you had wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9964.48)|
| 2:46:08| Thanks, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9968.199999999999)|
| 2:46:09| I wanted to follow up on some of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9969.199999999999)|
| 2:46:12| that I was hearing just to bring us back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9972.679999999998)|
| 2:46:17| to kind of what started this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9977.08)|
| 2:46:20| and emphasize that what we're hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9980.4)|
| 2:46:27| to come out of this process is a non-police response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9987.199999999999)|
| 2:46:32| that can serve a portion of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9992.76)|
| 2:46:38| that's being underserved currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9998.04)|
| 2:46:40| or not receiving the best services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10000.12)|
| 2:46:44| they could be receiving currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10004.2)|
| 2:46:46| And that's one reason why, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10006.36)|
| 2:46:49| mobile crisis has not been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10009.240000000002)|
| 2:46:51| because it is not a non-police response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10011.36)|
| 2:46:56| In terms of the data, I'm still want to encourage us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10016.560000000001)|
| 2:47:00| if we want to come together as a joint group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10020.0)|
| 2:47:02| that we create a space for us to work collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10022.76)|
| 2:47:06| These workshop spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10026.88)|
| 2:47:07| especially when we have such a small amount of time to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10027.88)|
| 2:47:11| do not allow us to review data thoroughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10031.04)|
| 2:47:16| as we need to do to really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10036.68)|
| 2:47:19| what's going on in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10039.2)|
| 2:47:21| Council Member Ryder brought up an overdose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10041.8)|

| 2:47:49| And so that's someone who could possibly have benefited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10069.08)|
| 2:47:53| from an alternative response service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10073.32)|
| 2:47:56| someone who he could go to to help counsel him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10076.32)|

| 2:48:09| Or, you know, what I've also heard is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10089.039999999999)|

| 2:48:21| What if they were able to call someone for help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10101.0)|
| 2:48:24| and not fear that law enforcement would respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10104.76)|
| 2:48:28| These are the stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10108.76)|
| 2:48:29| We don't necessarily have all of that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10109.92)|
| 2:48:32| coming from 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10112.4)|
| 2:48:34| But from, you know, being in community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10114.16)|
| 2:48:36| we hear what is happening in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10116.64)|
| 2:48:39| And that is what is motivating me and so many others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10119.84)|
| 2:48:43| to want us to consider and move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10123.36)|
| 2:48:47| on adopting a non-police response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10127.08)|
| 2:48:50| And so I'd encourage us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10130.68)|
| 2:48:51| if the county wants to continue in this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10131.960000000001)|
| 2:48:55| let's form a joint work group or a joint task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10135.28)|

| 2:49:02| And it will take a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10142.32)|
| 2:49:04| I'm gonna go over just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10144.36)|

| 2:49:07| What I envisioned is in the first six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10147.24)|
| 2:49:10| we would go through all of this to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10150.36)|
| 2:49:12| where would this be housed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10152.76)|
| 2:49:14| Who could respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10154.16)|
| 2:49:16| And kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10156.72)|
| 2:49:17| map out the very basic bones of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10157.72)|
| 2:49:21| And then we would take that and go look for funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10161.28)|
| 2:49:25| to help fund a planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10165.6)|
| 2:49:28| so that we can start to develop those protocols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10168.36)|
| 2:49:30| those dispatch codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10170.800000000001)|
| 2:49:32| understanding how this new program would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10172.480000000001)|
| 2:49:34| with alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10174.640000000001)|
| 2:49:36| So even though the initial proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10176.2)|
| 2:49:38| was six months of planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10178.800000000001)|
| 2:49:39| that's just to get us in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10179.960000000001)|
| 2:49:42| that we need alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10182.08)|
| 2:49:43| and we have individuals in our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10183.880000000001)|
| 2:49:47| who can help us move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10187.320000000002)|
| 2:49:49| Then we begin to map it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10189.12)|
| 2:49:52| So this is a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10192.039999999999)|
| 2:49:53| And I hope that we can make a commitment as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10193.6)|
| 2:49:56| and potentially also as a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10196.52)|
| 2:49:59| to creating space to move this work forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10199.039999999999)|
| 2:50:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10203.28)|
| 2:50:04| Before we get, before we close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10204.8)|
| 2:50:06| I'd like to recognize Chair Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10206.64)|
| 2:50:09| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10209.32)|
| 2:50:10| And thank you all for such candid comments and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10210.2)|
| 2:50:14| We definitely are here for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10214.44)|
| 2:50:17| I think that's very obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10217.8)|
| 2:50:21| Rather than reiterate what everyone in this room has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10221.84)|
| 2:50:26| because I agree with everything that has been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10226.4)|
| 2:50:30| I'm just gonna get to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10230.92)|
| 2:50:32| I'm gonna get to the hard asks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10232.119999999999)|
| 2:50:35| We are starting an empath unit as a short-term facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10235.76)|
| 2:50:40| three days to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10240.4)|
| 2:50:41| My question is, where do they go after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10241.84)|
| 2:50:44| The options locally, and I use quotes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10244.64)|
| 2:50:48| are Chattanooga, Blount County, Johnson City, or Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10248.16)|
| 2:50:55| If they go to Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10255.68)|
| 2:50:57| and are transported by our law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10257.28)|
| 2:51:00| that costs the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10260.28)|
| 2:51:03| So ask number one, a local Knox County state-funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10263.44)|
| 2:51:09| and staffed inpatient service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10269.56)|
| 2:51:11| for the uninsured and TennCare patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10271.32)|
| 2:51:15| Ask number two, a grant to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10275.4)|
| 2:51:19| and expand co-response team efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10279.6)|
| 2:51:23| build up the current one in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10283.48)|
| 2:51:26| and expand to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10286.16)|
| 2:51:29| And I will piggyback onto that with ask number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10289.56)|
| 2:51:34| have help from the state for a pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10294.56)|
| 2:51:37| for a rapid mobile response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10297.68)|
| 2:51:40| And the key word there is rapid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10300.56)|
| 2:51:44| If we get to these people, like the person on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10304.84)|
| 2:51:48| too late, we are too late, and we have lost a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10308.800000000001)|
| 2:51:54| And so with that, again, I thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10314.560000000001)|
| 2:51:58| Your discussions have been incredibly insightful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10318.12)|
| 2:52:00| Thank you to our service providers for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10320.6)|
| 2:52:04| But I hope, and as Council Member Parker just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10324.720000000001)|
| 2:52:09| I agree, let's do this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10329.44)|
| 2:52:12| Let's do this joint task force together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10332.08)|
| 2:52:14| so we can make these actionable items come to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10334.16)|
| 2:52:20| And thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10340.0)|

| 2:52:31| and let's talk some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10351.08)|
| 2:52:32| That needs to end at 7.51 on August the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10352.84)|
| 2:52:38| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10358.48)|

| 2:52:41| You know, I think what we've heard is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10361.880000000001)|
| 2:52:43| the mental health crisis that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10363.960000000001)|
| 2:52:47| is not unique to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10367.24)|
| 2:52:49| But I think what is unique is that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10369.68)|
| 2:52:53| these local legislative groups getting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10373.0)|
| 2:52:57| and committing, despite there being some differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10377.28)|
| 2:52:59| and maybe some perspectives and opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10379.960000000001)|
| 2:53:02| this is something we all can agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10382.12)|
| 2:53:04| And I think everyone has heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10384.28)|
| 2:53:06| And I think everyone has heard things this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10386.52)|
| 2:53:09| that we all agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10389.76)|
| 2:53:11| And I think that common purpose is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10391.6)|
| 2:53:13| what brought us here together today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10393.8)|
| 2:53:15| And I think that's the focus on us moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10395.92)|
| 2:53:19| I also want to just thank Chair Durette| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10399.16)|
