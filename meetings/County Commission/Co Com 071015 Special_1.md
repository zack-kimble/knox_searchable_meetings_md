| 2:07:10| The fourth Thursday is always Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| That is Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| So what about the 29th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| What is the following Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7635)|
| 2:07:24| What's earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| What's the first of the next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| The 26th will be the Monday after Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| What about the 26th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7649)|
| 2:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| I see Mr. Bosch walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| Does anybody want to come and talk to the podium or talk to us about the 26th being when we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| if we hear nothing from the courts, the 26th will be the day we make appointments for all 12 offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7665)|
| 2:07:52| Because I'd like to have all that round up and have it all decided before we start voting on these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| so we have the process basically laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| The dates, not the process, but the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| Well, that would give us two weeks from the 12th to if we went with the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7683)|
| 2:08:09| If we have the process already laid out and we just, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7689)|
| 2:08:13| Yeah, we can start laying it out because it's on our agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| I don't have a problem with the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| Commissioner Leuthold, you want to just add all that together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| I will just add that all together, that if on the 12th, if we don't have a positive resolution as far as being able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7702)|
| 2:08:30| have an election, then we will come back on the 12th and vote to have the appointments on the 26th of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7710)|
| 2:08:42| And we're voting now to have them on the 26th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| That we'd be, we'd have an appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| Well, I don't know why we'd have to come back on the 12th and vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| I think, in my mind, we'll have it between now and the 12th, we'll lay out the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| It's on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| It's on our agenda for next Monday, the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| But we don't have another meeting to lay out the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| Well, I mean, we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7743)|
