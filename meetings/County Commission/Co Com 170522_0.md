| 0:02:22| and testify before this the Knox County Bureau Board would you please stand at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| and raise your hand and be sworn. Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| you shall give in these matters shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| the truth so help you God. I do. Thank you. Be seated. Mr. Chairman they've been sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| Thank you Mr. Law Director. Now I'll have a question. As we are seated and have a quorum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| to give testimony are we missing one? We don't have any new ones. Thank you Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=170)|
| 0:03:01| Secretary. It's not a requirement since we do not have any applications. So we will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=181)|
| 0:03:11| right in knee deep in the items that are before us. Madam Clerk would you read the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=191)|
| 0:03:22| first caption. Consideration of suspension revocation of the beer permit for the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| establishment. Up and Smoke, 930 East Emory Road, Christie Selvage owner second offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| District 7. Is the owner present? Would you come down please. Give your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=214)|
| 0:03:42| address for the record sir. Chris Selvage, 348 Hickory Stone Lane, Powell, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=222)|
| 0:03:49| 37849. Okay and if you would step aside for just a second please sir. Captain Mays would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| you read the charge. On April 12, 2017 conducted an underage beer sting at Up and Smoke, 930| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=237)|
| 0:04:08| East Emory Road and my underage person bought a six pack Bud Light bottles. Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=248)|
| 0:04:19| Mr. Selvage you've heard the testimony against you in these matters. You have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| to affirm or deny and to give your side of the story in your testimony to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| Do you affirm or deny the charge? Yes I affirm. Okay this is your opportunity to give your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| side of the story to this board before they make their decision. It's pretty simple. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| presented a license that we did look at. I understand the clerk did look at the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| just didn't get the birth year, the math right on the birth year and did make the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| to the individual. Mr. Chairman. Thank you Mr. Law Director. Commissioner Busler. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=292)|
| 0:05:04| got just a couple of questions for you. The clerk that sold the beer, do they have a training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=304)|
| 0:05:17| In house training we have not done any external training. How long have you worked there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=317)|
| 0:05:26| How long has the clerk worked there? This individual just a couple of months. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=326)|
| 0:05:36| your second offense right? Correct. And they've worked there a couple of months and you haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=336)|
| 0:05:46| sent them through the training and they were getting ready to sell the beer? We do in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| house training. Commissioner Busler, I believe you and I have a question of the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=350)|
| 0:06:00| Let me ask the question first. Are you certified to train? Are we required to have external| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=360)|
| 0:06:09| training? Pardon us for just a second. We were kind of taken aback in that training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=369)|
| 0:06:23| is a very strict requirement in the transactions of selling beer whether it be legal or illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=383)|
| 0:06:35| Mr. Law Director, your discussion with the clerk. The issue I think what the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| are asking you, does your staff, your company have someone who is certified to give this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| training? No. We went to external training years ago but we had always thought it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=408)|
| 0:06:57| voluntarily to do it. So we are supposed to have mandatory external training. You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| to have mandatory training. You have to get it within 30 days and you have to renew it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| every three years. If you do it in house, your in house trainer has to be certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| as such to be a trainer to even do it in house. So, well I'm not going to get into what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| think on that. But anyway, I'll turn it back over to the board. Captain Mayes, did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| wish to speak? No, on the second offense. We're going to have to, yeah. Yes. The first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=446)|
| 0:07:39| offense was in April of last year. Thank you. Commissioner Bussler, did you wish to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=459)|
| 0:07:49| continue? Let me ask this to the Law Director. Well, if he hasn't renewed in three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=469)|
| 0:07:58| if he hadn't taken recertification, what? I cannot expound beyond the fact of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=478)|
| 0:08:08| has been testified here and what it seems to imply to me is that they do not have anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| there working that is within the legal realms to serve beer at this time because they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| not have the certification training. They have not been trained within the past three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| years and I haven't had testimony that comes forward that says that they are certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| to do the training in house. That would lead me to a conclusion that they do not have anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| properly trained to serve beer and unless they were just hired within the last 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| they're outside the window of compliance with the law. So, if there's no one there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| have you had recertification the last three years? My wife goes once a year, so we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| as the owner, we thought the owner had to go, so my wife has went and then two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| ago we had a manager go because my wife couldn't go, so technically we have had in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| two years, we've had two individuals go to the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| Commissioner Bussler, can I move on to other discussion? I'll come back to you. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Thomas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, you're not so clear here. You're saying you did some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=559)|
| 0:09:28| in house training, but also the other training they have to have to be certified, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| not been done either, right? Other than your wife and the manager a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| ago. Yeah, we've not done any training to get certified to train other staff, but my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=579)|
| 0:09:47| understanding was that the owner needed to go once a year, so we've been going. But none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| of your staff? Other than the manager. We did have the one manager go. I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| make sure you weren't saying, you know, we just quit doing our in house stuff, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| may have the other certification, so now I'm clear on that. Well, we do go over with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| new employees, you know, in house training as well. I understand. I mean, they are getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| some direction. Yes, sir. Okay. Well, that's going to have to be corrected. The other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| is, both offenses were April, is that right? Right at prom season. Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=619)|
| 0:10:30| I'll continue with Commissioner Smith. Question for the law director. In a convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=630)|
| 0:10:38| situation like this, it's basically what this is, tobacco. Are each individual that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| there required to have training, or is it just the owner? Unlike, I think in a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| everybody that's going to be serving has to be trained. To sell beer, you have to be certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| within 30 days of employment by a certified instructor, and you have to have it renewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| every 3 years. Every 3 years? If you're dealing with alcoholic beverages. Okay. Are you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=664)|
| 0:11:12| your employees aware of how our driver's license in the state of Tennessee are made, and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| the red stripe on them mean? We do go over that with them. I believe this individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| told the officer that they were not, but we have it actually posted at each register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| I've got a copy of the Tennessee driver's license, and it's got notations that points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| out the red border around the photograph. Thank you. Commissioner Schoonmaker. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=695)|
| 0:11:50| this question is for the law director. Since we've had dual violations within a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| the in-house, quote, employee training is obviously not working. The testimony is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=717)|
| 0:12:05| the employees are not certified, and does this warrant a revocation of the beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=725)|
| 0:12:15| as opposed to just a fine? That's not a legal question. That's a policy decision. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| what this board is here to decide. We just present the facts. The law says they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| to have the training, and this person has testified. They have two people that may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| qualified to say they have the training. I don't know whether they have or not. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| going with the testimony. The person that sold this, or if they have other employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| they are not certified to serve. Their in-house training, from what I'm hearing under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=764)|
| 0:12:52| testimony, is not certified to train the servers to serve. In just looking at those facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=772)|
| 0:13:02| the facts are they have two people that have a high probability that they can serve, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| no one else can. They have had two violations within the past 12 months. That's the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=788)|
| 0:13:19| From that point, you ascertain those facts and make a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| Thank you. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| Okay, so we don't know for sure, just by hearsay evidence, that they have somebody there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=808)|
| 0:13:36| has been trained, is what I'm hearing. Is that correct? That's all we're hearing is hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| Well, he's testifying under oath to his knowledge that his employees have not received training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| from a certified trainer. That was testimony before this tribunal. He has testified that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| his wife has received certified training within the past two years. In one year, she was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=836)|
| 0:14:06| able to go, and they sent a manager out, I'm assuming, to the certified training group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| That's how I got to the fact that they may have two people who are properly trained and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| certified to serve. Unless he has someone employed there in brand new less than 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| who could be a third person, not certified, but could still serve and receive their training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| before their 30 days in employment, the rest of the employees in that organization are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| not, cannot properly sell beer in Knox County. That's the facts as testified before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=875)|
| 0:14:45| Commissioner Bussler, let me call on Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to make a motion, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| While we're still in discussion of searching out the facts, let me then go back to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| Bussler for just a second. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| Well, what I'm hearing here is that he's not, you run the location, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=903)|
| 0:15:12| I'm the owner. I'm there quite often. To go back just a little bit, the individual that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=912)|
| 0:15:20| committed this offense, she went to a beer training, a four-hour training, like two Thursdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| ago as part of her, I guess, consequences of committing the offense from going to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=926)|
| 0:15:35| So I guess she has actually had what I guess would be considered the proper training as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| well. And I would think the individual from last April also had to go through that same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| thing. So there may be others that have that training. I just need to see if I can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| the documentations and provide it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| Well, here's the problem. She had it, but this was done before, the violation occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| before she had the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| So I guess the second offense, what we do is what a, was it $1,500 fine? Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=965)|
| 0:16:17| $1,500 fine, but we really don't know if you have people there that can run, except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| for your testimony, and I'm not, can we, we can't even pass on this, can we, Mr. Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=983)|
| 0:16:33| Director, because we don't know if there's there people that can really run it, except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Mr. Chairman, can I make a motion? I mean, we're, Charlie, are you just, you got an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| of what you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Well, if we find him, I mean, he, it may still be illegal. I'm not sure what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| do to make sure he's legal to do what he's supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Let's try, let's try this. May I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| May I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Commissioner Bussler has the floor, and I believe he, that you'd make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| All right, I'd like to make a motion that we revoke his license, and that upon completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| of training of the entire staff, we'll review again whether he can get his license back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| Now, I realize you're going to go to court, and no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| No, the revocation is for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| No, a suspension is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| We don't have a motion. He said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Well, the motion is to suspend the license until all of them have approved training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| and it's, and it's, and it's written off by the people who do the training, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| proof of all the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Suspension for so many, what was the days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| See, the motion is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| I mean, if you, if you do that, you have no fine. I mean, you can do both, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| you don't, you're not listing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Add the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Restate it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Well, here's my position. I think that we should revoke the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1079)|
| 0:18:07| That's what I feel we should do here, and not just suspend, and fine, we do that over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| And if you listen to the testimony, what's happened at this place is just going on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| If we revoke the license, doesn't that in some way affect the real property for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| licensing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Do you own the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| See, we're going to be punishing the landowner that had nothing to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| That's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| I want to ask another question. The first offense, was this the same person that committed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| No, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Was it you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| No, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Your wife or your manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| No, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| They're still employed there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| They went through the court process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| But they didn't go through training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| I believe they had to as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| From what I can assert, we probably have four people that have the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| Okay, so you're thinking maybe the person that committed the first offense has had training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| That was part of what the process they had to go through, is they did have to go attend a four-hour training class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1160)|
| 0:19:28| In order for them to surpass a third court issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| And this person still works there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| So you do have somebody there that can sell, but that's the only person there that we know right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| So I would like to make a motion that no person is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| I believe there are four people that have the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1186)|
| 0:19:54| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| So both employees, the one last year and the one this year, are still employees at your store, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1198)|
| 0:20:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| I'm feeling that since they went through the court process and paid close to $1,000 in court costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| that hopefully they're going to be rehabilitated for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| And plus, you know, versus bringing in somebody totally new and having to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| Well, hopefully, for your sakes, since you're the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| But how many employees do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| There are six total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| And so there's four you think are trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| So is that four including you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| Well, yeah, one was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| I'm counting my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| I'm not counting myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| But there would be six people that work pretty regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| I don't work regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| I'm there often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| Commissioner Smith, I think you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| We don't have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| Question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| We do not have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| I believe we have a motion on the floor from Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Was it second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| We have a second right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| And it doesn't have a fine on it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| The motion on the floor does not have a fine on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| And the substitute motion would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| $1,500 fine, 30-day suspension until he gets all of his employees trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| or the choice of a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| Or a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| Why only $1,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| Oh, it's the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Make that $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| The motion that has been made as a substitute is for a 30-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| and a $2,000 fine or a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1325)|
| 0:22:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| We are now in discussion of the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| which is a 30-day suspension and $2,000 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| or a 90-day suspension at the choice of the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| Commissioner Gill, do you wish to speak to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| I was just going to ask if he was actually trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| and had gone through any training at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| I have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I have not in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| The substitute motion that is before us is that there be a 30-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1376)|
| 0:23:04| and $2,000 fine or a 90-day suspension at the choice of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1384)|
| 0:23:14| Seeing no further discussion, those in favor of the substitute motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| I hear one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| The substitute motion is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1412)|
| 0:23:40| Now then, sir, the choice that you have before you is a 30-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1420)|
| 0:23:49| and $2,000 fine or a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1429)|
| 0:23:58| So the 30 days is a suspension or a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| The 30-day suspension is also connected to a $2,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| That's the one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| The other side of the choice is a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| I mean, if I can provide a documentation of the four individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| The motion is, that's the motion that has been passed by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| You have a choice of 30-day suspension and $2,000 fine, that's A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1463)|
| 0:24:34| or B, 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| So what's the process after the 30 days or the 90 days as far as getting reinstated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| I would suggest that you would probably be visited again by the same young gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1487)|

| 0:27:22| On April 12, 2017, conducted underage beer stinging at Ingalls 7466 Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1642)|
| 0:27:31| Underage person purchased a six-pack of Bud Light bottles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| The clerk did look at this visually two times at the ID, then entered it into the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| and no date question mark on date entered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1664)|

| 0:28:05| The same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| He said the customer came in and tried to buy or bought a six-pack of Bud Light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| and the employee looked at it once and then didn't type anything in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| and he took it back and then typed in the wrong date of birth year, I'm guessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| and then he made the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| I can't remember what the customary first offense has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| Is it $1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1714)|

| 0:30:22| On April 12, 2017, conducted an underage beer sting at Big D's 6501 Manorville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1822)|
| 0:30:31| bought six-pack Bud Light bottles, and the clerk observed ID only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1831)|

| 0:30:49| and any information you'd like for them to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| The clerk, as Officer said, he observed the ID, but he made the mistake in the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1852)|
| 0:31:02| In the date, he made the mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| He thought he was already 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| There shouldn't be a date problem there because you have color coded on the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| This is your first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1881)|

| 0:31:38| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| You were in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| About two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| I guess this is for Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| When the offense occurs, do you check the server to see if their license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| or current training at the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| Do we know if this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| My question is, does this server have been trained or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| He was not trained at that time, but now I already had him trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| So he was not trained and served beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| He was not trained at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| But I was trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| I'm the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| I'm always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| I always take training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Every one or two years I take training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| I'm with Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| We're two lenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| We have someone selling beer that was not trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| and we're only going to give him a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| That's hard to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| I guess, Wolfie, in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| do you ask if they're certified, that they've been trained, certified trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1955)|
| 0:32:48| Sometimes when we go in, we'll ask if they've got an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| A lot of them do not have, or they've got one at another place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| and they take it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| So by the time we get back, we don't know where they've gone to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Well, I guess in the future, if I have any more, I'll ask beforehand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| and make sure that if they serve beer without certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| it should be more than just a $1,000 fine, it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| And, sir, how long has this employee been with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| It's two or three months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| And are they still an employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| Yeah, but I had him trained now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| He's in compliance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| The motion that is before us is $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2015)|

| 0:33:57| Do you wish to have the $1,000 fine or the 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| I think I'll go with the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2044)|

| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| You have seen the procedure here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| We will ask the officer to come and present his side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| You will have an opportunity to affirm or deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| and also have an opportunity to give your facts before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| I'll ask Captain May to give his testimony at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| On April 12, 2017, conducted an underage beer sting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| Raceway 9002 Oak Ridge Highway, purchased six-pack bottle Miller Lite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2125)|
| 0:35:33| and the clerk did not ask for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| Do you affirm or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| I affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| This is your opportunity to tell this board whatever facts you would like for them to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| The clerk's been employed with us for three years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| and I have a few letters from Sheriff's Office where he was in a sting operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| where he checked his ID and he went through that operation correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| but this time I don't know what happened to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| He didn't check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| That was a mistake, but he's been through that sting operation a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| and he was good three or four times and he's been good with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| but this time he made a mistake and I don't know what I can say about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| but he made a mistake there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| I've got a rundown of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| I guess there's some new commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| I'm going to kind of give them a rundown of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I know that you've only been the owner for three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| One and a half years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| So this location has been cited six times from 2009 to 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2206)|
| 0:36:55| and it all started with the Sadiq family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| I think that they were cousins of yours that sold the store off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| I just know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| I just know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| You just know him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| So last year in 2015 you were fined $2,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| and given a 60-day suspension for the same offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| It was not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| What's your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| My name is Amir Bughani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Who's Kareem Bughani?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| That's Hassan's partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| You're what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| That must be Henry's partner, Hassan Sadiq's partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| That was under the AMPA group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| Yeah, AMPA group, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| And so you've renamed it the 6759 LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| Yeah, that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| I got the location from Henry Sadiq in April of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| And so technically right now all we have is a first offense on this owner and location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| or on this owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| Well, as upset as I am that you guys are not doing your job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| and I think the most we could do is fine you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| I'm going to ask the Attorney General's office to look at your location as a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| You are continuously being in violation of the Bureau Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| I mean, you've lost, this location has lost its Bureau license on two occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| and you're not doing anything to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| Is there a reason why you're not doing anything to change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| I think an employee made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| No, your employee made a decision, not a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| That was wrong, but I got him certified and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| Was he certified prior to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Yeah, he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| He's been working at the location too, and he's been working there for a couple years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| I'll wait and see what the others have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| So, Commissioner Anders, on your document there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| so are they just changing business owners every year, year and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2342)|
| 0:39:10| I mean, because obviously if they keep violating the beer laws of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2350)|
| 0:39:21| does it show just multiple family members or just friends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| The Sadiq family had three different people involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| and now he's saying that the prior owner, who has his last name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| was a business partner of Mr. Sadiq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| That's one of my cousins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| He's been working with him, and I'm not involved with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| I'm his cousin, so we have the same last name, but I'm not involved with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| I find that hard to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Do we have an option then to look at the location as a habitual offender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| even though that they just change owners conveniently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Well, I don't know that the law allows us to look at the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| It looks at the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| And so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| I find it very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| I'd like to shut your beer sales down for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| but on a first offense I think a judge would throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| I think the law department would be heartburned to defend that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| and I don't want to put them through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| But I'd certainly like to see you either clean your business up or close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| One of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| I mean, you're right by the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| I mean, this is prom season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| You're right by the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| You're in a prime area for somebody to come and violate the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| and you're letting them do it, and I'm kind of getting tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| So I'm going to make a motion for a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| the motion that is properly before us is for a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2452)|
| 0:41:03| Yeah, second's over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Just quickly, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| is there any problem with that in being that previously we've either or'd it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2470)|
| 0:41:18| Whatever is in the will of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| you have the opportunity to go up to a $2,500 fine for any offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| selling to a minor, all the way up to revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Commissioner Anderson, do you not want a fine on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Well, I think he'll lose enough on this 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| I mean, that's a heavy traffic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| I think it's more than $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| He's going to lose more than $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| or otherwise they wouldn't jump so fast on taking the fine over the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| No, I'm not talking about a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| The motion that is properly before us is for a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| Sir, the action of this body is to suspend your license for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| Okay, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2535)|

| 0:42:52| Mr. Woody, you've seen the procedure here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| The officer will make the allegations against your company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2575)|

| 0:43:57| She goes through a yearly recertification to make sure that she is eligible to teach the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| The cashier actually had gone through the class just on April 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| which was about a week before the sale of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| and the company's stance on the illegal sale of alcohol is zero tolerance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| and this cashier is no longer employed by our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| I make a motion since this is the first offense for a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| Well, I just wanted to add Food City takes this seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| and I've had some contact me on this, their managers and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| and they actually help with our staying and helping train and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| and so I just wanted to make it known to the community that Food City is very serious about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| and they do have that zero tolerance on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| and they do the extent of training and they keep all of it on file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| so I'd really like to make a substitute motion of just a $500 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| just because of what they have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| but the $1,000, because they have all their records in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| and a T's crossed and I've got it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| so if the rest of the commission, we can keep the $1,000 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| but I just wanted to let them know that they're some of the best I've ever seen at trying to keep everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2737)|
| 0:45:46| I believe the substitute motion is going to die for a lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2746)|
| 0:45:56| Do you have further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| the motion that is properly before us is for a $1,000 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2765)|
| 0:46:15| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Mr. Woody, you have a choice of a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| We'll pay the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| And you do that within seven days to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| And also I would like to, although this is not a favorable circumstance for us to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| say that I like your knowledge of the subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| the straightforward testimony that you've given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| and the zero tolerance of your company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| When we first looked back on some of these fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| when we first started going up on fines to make it be a little bit more punitive to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2828)|
| 0:47:16| I think we did start out with like a $500 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| but then we went directly to a $1,000 fine, and that was it for the first $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| and then it goes on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| For something along the way, we really need to take a look at being more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2847)|
| 0:47:37| when we set a precedent, let's stick to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| but let's find out what those precedents should be when we do these beer boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| And I think we should maybe take a look at that down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| that we're going to be doing this, this, and this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| and we don't have to have a lot of these discussions like what we're having now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| But I do appreciate Food City for what they do and how they take care of it, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| and I hated to do that for them, but that's the precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Just quickly for the law director again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| You know how there are some roads that say during this next 20 miles the fines are doubled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| This prom season thing, because this is what kids do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| They skip school at the end of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| and some of them will try to buy beer and go to the lake or go to the quarry or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| If we did anything where during a certain window of the year the fines were more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2910)|
| 0:48:39| do you think that would probably end up getting thrown out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| I think as long as you have a rational basis upon which you make your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| based upon the facts presented to this body, I don't see it getting overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| And that's when you ask me the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| the statute gives you the power up to $2,500 at a single fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| or up to revocation in any combination within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| And if you as a body have a rational basis for that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| I think we'll have a good shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| I do not believe that anyone that comes before this beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| they know exactly what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| They're selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| They hire an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| They put them out on the counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| They're selling beer 30, 60 days before their train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| And we're letting them go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| We're letting them buy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| It ought to be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| It should be more than a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| It ought to be a $1,000 fine and 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| They know that when they walk to that podium that they've done wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| and it wasn't a mistake, they sold beer to a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| and they were not trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| And we're letting them slip by with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| See, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| Could we put in our ordinance that if they employ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| and are caught employing or let's say we've got one of these guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| that haven't been trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| could we enhance maybe another $500 or $1,000 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| for an uncertified employee selling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Could we put that in our ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Can you research that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| I could research it, but I think it's a policy decision based on the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| You could do it without it in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| I know that, but I think if you give them some guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| like if I don't certify this guy and he gets busted, that's another $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| It separates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| And I guess we'd have to ask the state attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| if that's legal within our state allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| I'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| If you'll draft the ordinance for next month, I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| I think when we send out the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| we do send out a letter of notice that you have to appear here, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| In that letter it will have to say that you need to bring the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| for the person who was busted for serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| As far as different amount of fines, different times of the season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| I don't think one beer sale at any given time is less important than any other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| So I don't see a reason to have different levels of fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| If you want to go up on the fines, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| But they're all any day of the year are just as bad as any other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3085)|
| 0:51:32| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| And the reason that I had thought of doing a $500 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| is Food City had their person certified trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| So that's not the same as all theirs are trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| but we've been letting others come here today and they're not trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| So there is this big gap, you know, as to who gets what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| So I do think if there's a way we can find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| if we can put it to where when Woofie and them do their sting operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| and someone is caught, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| you could find out if they have been certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| or if they have the correct paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| Either way, that they have to bring it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| or that they're supposed to have that on file, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| So it's just whatever they say down here that we have to take their word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| to make a serious decision about their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| and about them harming those out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| Each thing has a certain circumstance that comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| You have Food City here that does extensive training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| They still have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| But then you have people come up before us that's individually owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| There's only one or two people in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| and they just kind of thumbed their nose at us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| hey, we'll take the $1,000 fine and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| And I don't know if we can, under the statute of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| treat somebody differently than we can others for the same offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| But if we could, I would like to be a little bit more punitive on the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| that come up here and one or two people, it's all they have to train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| and yet they get busted for not being trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| I think we need to really take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| The people that are really trying and they get busted on it, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| well, anyway, it's not fair to them to work so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| and then one employee just goes, well, I'm just going to sell it to somebody I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| I'd like to suggest that the commission look at a different policy of no fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| and suspend the license for 30 days, because everyone takes the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| If we start suspending the license, I think we might start seeing a difference in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| because the fine is nothing to these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| And not that they're good business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| And as far as Food City is, they sold the beer, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| I mean, they may be a great company, but still, they sold the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| just like all these other people did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| Correct, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| But making differences, they're certified people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| and that is going to happen, so I don't know how we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| I'm sorry, but I did not hear you holding up Ingalls, which is the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| What you've done is you've run yourself into not getting to have a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| I took mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| Seeing no further business come before the beer board, this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| Excuse me, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3291)|

| 0:54:58| Captain Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| I was just going to tell you that we've checked this spring every convenience store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| grocery store in Knox County, and you've seen what we've brought a couple months ago and tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| So, most of the places are doing what they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3317)|

| 0:59:42| I did want to add two more things to what the resolution says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| that I think is pretty outstanding that really exemplifies what Coach Courtney has attained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3587)|

| 1:01:19| We won the state championship and it goes back to Knox County and Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| It's representative of how well we try to do things right in town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| and try to do things academically and athletically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3689)|

| 1:05:34| And Farragut was 28 points down and came back to win 45 to 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| So it's just an amazing accomplishment for Farragut High School and very well deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| And again it's an honor to present this resolution to Coach Courtney and the boys. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3945)|
| 1:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3957)|
| 1:06:10| Madam Clerk, continuing on with one other resolution 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3970)|
| 1:06:20| Commissioner Anders, do you wish people to join you there at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| Yeah, Mr. and Ms. Daley and the mayor and Representative King, if security hadn't found out he's in here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=3985)|
| 1:06:41| Today we're going to, last week sometime, I think it was myself and Commissioner Thomas, Commissioner Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4001)|
| 1:06:49| I think that was it, that we were able to make it out to the opening of the Carnes Lions Club all-inclusive playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4009)|
| 1:06:58| And who I have beside me is Monica and Rick Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| And if you live in Carnes and have heard anything about the playground you've heard about Monica and Rick Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| And so Knox County, as you guys granted in the last budget, we sent off after the budget cleared and we had some money left over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4030)|
| 1:07:20| we sent $50,000 I think to this playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| But that was a drop in the bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| She'll tell you it meant a lot, and it does, but it was a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of work and the investment that the community made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| And so it was great to partner with the Lions Club and be able to do that as Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| but really the community in itself stood up and built a multi-million dollar, or at least a million dollar playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| It's beautiful. I hope Jolie can get a picture, she's not going to be able to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| Okay, we've got some pictures, I'll email them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| But if they, Monica and the Lions Club has presented Knox County with this plaque,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| it's just in recognition of our partnership with the Lions Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| And so Mayor, if you'll come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| And Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| It just says, Knox County, I'm sorry, Karnes Lions Club, all-inclusive playground, government partners, Knox County 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4088)|
| 1:08:15| And so we'll probably present this maybe to Parks and Rec or somewhere in the Mayor's office and have it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| But it's a debt of gratitude that we owe to the Lions Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| There's the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| And Mr. Chairman, if you would allow me privilege on the honorarium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4109)|
| 1:08:36| Madam Clerk, we have an Item 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| Could you please read Resolution 103 into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4119)|
| 1:08:51| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring Monica and Rick Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| Whereas in 2015, Monica and Rick Daly, as members of the Karnes Lions Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| took their vision of a community all-inclusive playground in the Karnes area to the Karnes Club Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| Whereas Monica and Rick spent countless hours of their time to find the best design, products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| and layout for a playground for all children could play with no matter of their fiscal limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| Whereas with a drawing of the playground in hand, the Daly's began to gather community support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| and many businesses, churches, and service organizations soon began to support the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| And whereas the Karnes Lions Club generally put up the first $100,000 to establish a commitment to the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4173)|
| 1:09:42| and to assist in obtaining a matching grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| And whereas on September 7, 2016, the Karnes Lions Club broke ground on the 13,000 square foot all-inclusive playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4185)|
| 1:09:53| And whereas the playground contains musical instruments for children of all ages, a walking track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| a 20 by 20 playground, and numerous slide swings and jungle gyms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| And whereas on May 7, 2017, the park was dedicated and opened for the use and enjoyment of all who has already proven to be an asset to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4205)|
| 1:10:15| Now therefore be it resounded by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| The Commission of Knox County hereby honors Monica and Rick Daly for their commitment to the cause of building this wonderful community asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4219)|
| 1:10:28| With the support of the Karnes Lions Club, the Daly family has spent three years of time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| to send the playground to today and we applaud and thank Monica and Rick for their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4234)|
| 1:10:42| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage is provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| So moved, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Thank you, Commissioner Anders. Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Motion is properly before us to approve. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| The motion carries. Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| Yeah, a little bit more about the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| It has already been heavily used and Monica and Rick and to hear the story at the opening about how all this came to fruition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4268)|
| 1:11:18| if they were on a business trip or a family trip or a vacation, they were stopping and looking at playgrounds and spending their own time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| and I think it took them three days to get up north a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| I think they talked about that, but I really appreciate the work that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| There's on the front entrance kind of to the right where the little yellow house is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| there's a plaque of Knox County Government as a partner and Smith Built Homes and who else is on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| Pot and Lions Club International are there and if you go on there, there's numerous brick pavers that the community bought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| but Knox County has a brick paver as well and it's just a beautiful site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| It's all AstroTurf. There's no mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| It's unbelievable to see kids that have the same ability to perform on a playground no matter what their limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4319)|
| 1:12:07| and Monica has just told me tonight and if she wants to elaborate, she can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| The Children's Hospital and other therapy centers are already talking about coming out and doing physical therapy at that playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| So it's not only a playground, it's health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| I think Knox County Health Department also gave a grant as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| Representative Roger Kane was my partner on the government side and Roger, do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| This truly is a gift to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| It is the only all-inclusive playground of this size and caliber anywhere in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| If you've not been out there to take your grandchildren, you need to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| It is truly a gem in the Carnes community and we're glad that Monica and Rick had the vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4361)|
| 1:12:48| and amazingly enough, if this had been built at the county level, it would be over a million dollar project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4368)|
| 1:12:55| I can guarantee you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| But by hard work, donations and Monica has a gift for twisting arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| and a lot of people gave, they gave asphalt, they gave concrete, they gave a lot of stuff to make this building happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4382)|
| 1:13:09| It's truly, truly, even the land was given from the community club back to the Lions Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| so that they could use this and they had a tennis court bulldozed to make all this dream happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| So it's truly a wonderful playground. I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Thank you, Representative Kane. Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd just like to thank Rick and Monica for the great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| That's, I was just sitting back there thinking, this is one of the reasons we live in the greatest place in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| It's because people like this just roll up their sleeves, they don't wait on anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| and they just make it happen and I want to thank you all so much because it is all inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| That's how the kids get to play on it, even the 52-year-old kids get to play on it occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| So I want to thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| I want to thank the State Representative and I want to thank you, Brad, for all the work you've done on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| and I appreciate the opportunity to be here and I appreciate you all more than I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| Yes, and the recipients, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| Well, I'm not, I'm usually not at a loss for words and usually can't shut me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| I'm not quite sure what to say except for thank you very much for the appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| But I really believe if you were to come out for just a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| and see the people that have actually traveled over two hours to this playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| This is not just helping Knox County, which I know that was the purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| but it's for everyone to be able to play on an equal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| And there is nothing like this in the South, not just in Knoxville, but not just Tennessee, but in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| And we truly do appreciate you all stepping up and being partners and helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| Every amount made your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4490)|
| 1:15:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| Hey, Monica.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| I got really tickled when we had the opening session before last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| It just so happened the blue and the gold are Korns Beavers colors, but that's Lions Club colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4529)|
| 1:15:40| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| And so I said to someone, I said, oh, because of Korns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| And I said, no, it just happened to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| That's our Lions Club colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| So it was an honor to be able to see this and be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4552)|

| 1:16:03| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| It's my great honor to introduce my pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| He's a good man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| He tells it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| And it's hard to, in this day and time, it's hard to find the pastors that will treat their flock, treat their community as well as this man does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4575)|
| 1:16:26| I'd like to introduce my pastor, Mr. Frank Kent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| Welcome, Pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4593)|

| 1:16:56| Give them the wisdom and the knowledge and the understanding and the courage, Lord, to stand up for what's right and what's best for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4616)|
| 1:17:04| This we pray in Jesus' name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4624)|

| 1:17:13| If everyone would please stand, face the flag, and give the proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4641)|

| 1:17:47| Did I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=4667)|

| 1:44:10| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| I'd like to point out to everyone watching tonight that we are setting the tax rate right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| now and we do have new assessments that came out, but this tax rate will be adjusted after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| all the assessments are fully done and sometime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=6261)|

| 1:44:44| And I'm just pointing that out because I don't want people trying to figure out what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| taxes are going to be based upon this rate and their new assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=6288)|

| 2:18:33| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| Yeah, this coming Tuesday, Amber Roundtree, school board member and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| will be at Gap Creek Market meeting with the public from 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8320)|
| 2:18:49| Commissioner Daly, would you also in a moment announce your Memorial Day activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8329)|
| 2:18:57| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| Yeah, I'll be brief. I'm on my way to a scout meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| but tonight at the meeting we're announcing the Ernest Trotter Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| This is a memorial fund in honor of a scout that was in my troop and passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8346)|
| 2:19:12| Funds that are raised for this fund will go to pay for scouts who cannot afford to attend summer camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8352)|
| 2:19:18| or participate in the scouting program here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| So if any of you all would like another reason to get involved in scouting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| please see me afterward to support this fund. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8366)|
| 2:19:30| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| I just wanted to remind everybody about Fountain City's Day Memorial event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8372)|
| 2:19:37| It will be Monday, the 29th. It's from 10 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8377)|
| 2:19:42| The program will begin at 3 o'clock there at the gazebo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8382)|
| 2:19:49| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| Thank you. Correct me if I'm wrong. It's Old Gray Cemetery, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| 10 a.m. on Memorial Day, I will be speaking for a few minutes on our past soldiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8395)|
| 2:20:03| Memorial Day, I've been, if you'll bear with me just a second, I've been researching Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8403)|
| 2:20:09| Memorial Day was actually started during the Civil War. It's called Decoration Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| And I've learned a lot about it trying to do just something together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| So I'd like for everyone to come out and honor the scouts, but mainly honor the war dead and all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8418)|
| 2:20:25| It's Memorial. We celebrate Veterans Day. That's for the living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8425)|
| 2:20:31| We celebrate Memorial Day for those who gave the ultimate sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8431)|
| 2:20:36| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| Seeing no further discussion, Director Green, thank you for your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170522?start=8445)|
