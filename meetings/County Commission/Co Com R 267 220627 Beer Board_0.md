| 0:08:38| Yeah, I've lived in Powell all my life, been in business for 36 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=518)|
| 0:08:46| and have really worked hard on this never happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| Then I'm the very one that did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| All my kids live in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| All my grandsons do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| So I'd just like for it to be on record what actually happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Big John Bruin, local celebrity, had passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| A man came in, asked me about his funeral the weekend before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| So I was talking to him, and I had another girl, well, woman, working for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| She's worked for me 30, the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| And she was making that man's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| I was telling about the funeral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| Then the underage, CI, whatever you call him, came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| So I walked around there and told her I'd get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| And my hearing ain't what it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| I hadn't been working nights until that week for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| And I heard her say, you don't have to card him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| So I thought he'd just been coming in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| I rang him up, gave him a discount so he didn't have to bust another dollar to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| Bagged it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| He walked outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Then I turned around to her and said, when did he start coming in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| Because I'd never seen him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| And she said, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| I said, you'll have to card him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| So as soon as she said that, without the detective coming in or nobody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| there's just two cars in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| So I knew he got in this Charger over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| But I still didn't think nothing about being a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| But I went outside immediately without them coming in to tell him that I need to see his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| And then I was going to try to get the beer back if he was underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| So I walked up to the driver's window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| They were blacked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| I couldn't, you know, I just figured he was driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| So I stood there, well, a minute, but it seemed like a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| And then the detective rolled his window down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| And then I saw him writing on that clipboard and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| So that's when I knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| And I did end up paying him back for the beer anyway, but minus the discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| But that's the first I knew that it was him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| I mean, there's no way I'd have intentionally done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| I've been there, like I say, 36 years, had my beer license since 91, and hadn't had any violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=672)|
| 0:11:21| And I'd just like for that to be on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Given that Commissioner Hill's not here, I will make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| Would you rather have the $1,000 fine or the 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=694)|
| 0:11:45| Can I answer after I check my count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| I ain't going to lie to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| If I say it, my wife will kill me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| It's not an immediate payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| You have seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Well, then, I mean, I'll probably do that $1,000 deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| I mean, I don't make nothing off beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| All the beer companies have gallon reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| But it's just for my local customers there, convenience for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| And I'd have to tell the story 10,000 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| The clerk's office will send you a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Since you're going to do the $1,000 fine, then you can mail it back to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Chairman, did we have a second and a vote on that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| So I'll make a motion for a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=754)|

| 0:13:19| And you can either admit it or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| And tell this board anything you want to tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| On April 11, 2022, an underage person working with the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| conducted an underage compliance check at the Dollar General Market, 7603 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=813)|

| 0:13:44| did sell an alcoholic beverage to an underage person after checking the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| Will you admit or deny the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| We admit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=832)|

| 0:13:56| And then we took swift action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| We did terminate her employment immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| We also had the associates at that location go back through the alcohol sales training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| in an effort to curb any further issues like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| And I believe it's the first offense in, what, roughly 13 years since that permit was issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=856)|

| 0:15:51| located at 2064 Casting Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=951)|

| 0:15:59| and this is that individual's second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| Do you admit or deny the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=965)|

| 0:16:33| but I also see beer permit was issued March 31st of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| On here it says 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1003)|

| 0:16:50| I do have a question for Officer Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Was this this individual's first offense, I'm sorry, second offense at this establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| And I think in the last two years, there's been a change in the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| It's their third offense since I took over February of 21, I guess, but they changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1023)|
| 0:17:11| I took over February of 21, I guess, but they changed owners of the permit in March of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1031)|
| 0:17:22| Director Boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| I just want this board to know, I mean, what happened happened, they admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| I talked to, there's an attorney in the 615 area code that called me that says he represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| the owners of all these markets, including this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| And he admitted what was admitted here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| He said that they're curing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| I feel I need to tell you this because if he were here as attorney, he would tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| And then he also, interestingly, he said, if there's a third offense, how bad is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| I said, it's really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| And he said, well, I want them to know what's going to happen if there's a third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| So for whatever that's worth, I thought I ought to relate that to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you, Director Boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-beer-board?start=1087)|
