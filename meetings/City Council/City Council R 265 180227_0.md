| 0:01:57| Councilwoman Welch. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| Okay, we're all here tonight. Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Discussion? We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| Any opposed? The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| Items for postponement. Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| Thank you, Mayor. Item 10A, the hearing on zoning matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| I would recommend and move that we remand this to MPC to consider a zoning appeal or zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=145)|
| 0:02:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| Okay, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| I guess that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| That was you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Councilman Roberto, I looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| We're scooching down too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| Okay, who was it that wants to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Okay, I'm calling on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| I really think we should have some debate about this one rather than just passing it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| I think that ultimately it probably will get sent back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| but I'd request respectfully that we go ahead and leave it on the agenda and discuss it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| so that maybe we can give some guidance to folks when they're reviewing it going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=210)|
| 0:03:41| Mr. Saunders, are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| I was going to let this have whatever discussion now, and if we could bring it to a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| if we vote to hear it later on with the agenda, that's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| So I was just asking the law director, since this is an appeal, the actual item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| if they wanted to discuss, they wouldn't be discussing the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| They would be discussing whether to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| Right, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| That could be done at either place on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| Vice Mayor Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| No, I simply, as I'm responding to Councilman Steyer, said I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=256)|
| 0:04:27| If we want to send it back, I wouldn't mind it being voted on whether we want to send it back or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| and I was just going to be silent on that and let Council make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| Okay, so you want to go vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| You want to go ahead and vote on remanding it back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| Remanding it back, yeah, to consider other zoning possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| To consider other zoning options, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| So the motion and the second is to remand it back to MPC to consider other zoning options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| rather than the aye that is there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| Okay, Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| I guess, is this technically an item for postponement, or would that be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| if you just wanted to hear, I guess Councilman Roberto just wanted to hear it in regular order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| I don't, is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| This is under Robert's Rules of Order, similar to a motion to refer to committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| which has the same priority as a motion to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| and therefore is appropriate for consideration at this time under motions for postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| because it is a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| So if that motion is made, that motion must be discussed, but only that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| You don't take the matter up on its merits unless that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| And then if that motion fails, then it's taken up on its merits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| and it would go back to its regular order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| And so, Mr. Saunders, I guess Mr. Roberto was just asking for it to be heard in regular order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| so we could discuss it a little more in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| I'm not uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| I just want you to be aware of what you would discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| would be whether you are sending it back to MPC or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| It wouldn't be, you wouldn't start the administrative hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| and have both sides present their matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| whether you should grant the appeal and whether you should oppose the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| unless this motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| Well, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| I guess it's up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| So if this motion fails now, then when it gets to the agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| then either they discuss the appeal or if there's another motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| or to remand back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| then you would have the thorough discussion on whether to send it back or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| I wouldn't mind hearing from other colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| My turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| Put your mic down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| Is it not on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Oh, I'm not close enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| So right now we're just, we've got a motion on the floor and a second to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| and send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| With no recommendations whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| To consider other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| With no recommendation for us of what we think would be a better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| we're not making any antidotes or notes to MPC or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| We're leaving it in their court to decide what's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| That's what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| That's the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| And I think my sense that I get from Andrew is that Councilman Roberto is to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| some discussion to maybe make some of the matters discussed up front so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| when it goes back to MPC they have some inkling as to why we sent it back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| That was my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| That would be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| This could be a motion to send back to MPC to consider C-4, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| or to consider I-1 or to consider whatever zoning motion there could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| It could be a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| If someone wanted to amend this motion or offer a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| it would continue to be a priority motion and you could discuss that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| which is which zoning designation you want them to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| But that is not a part of this particular motion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| With all due respect, I appreciate those remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| I did not specify a specific zoning code because I think there may be a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| available, maybe more than two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| Councilperson Ryder, your discussion was really where I was wanting to go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=533)|
| 0:09:03| We're not precluded from taking any action to send this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| or give recommendations on what we're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| or certainly to let the folks that are doing the review hear the questions that we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=550)|
| 0:09:18| so that if they do receive this, then they can make a decision from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| My point was only that I think it's premature to do this before we have any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| So my suggestion is to or what I would do is vote no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| and move this on into regular discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| Well, this is sure interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Mr. Saunders, would you consider withdrawing your motion so we can just hear this in regular order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| Or we could just take a vote, and then if it doesn't pass, then it gets heard on regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| Well, the reason why I say that, Mayor, because obviously if it passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| then it ends discussion on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| So I'm sort of debating do I say what I wanted to say here or hope that it's voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| we hear discussion on it, and then vote on the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| I'm beginning to hear at least two or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| so I think there may be enough interest in discussing this that I will withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Yes, withdraw the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Are there any items to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| So how about items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| So 5D are the consent items, 11N through Q are pensions, and 12A is 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=633)|

| 0:11:01| and they're, I guess, pursuing their inside government badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| So welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| We saw a little bit of parliamentary procedure and good discussion for council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| and there will be more when we get to this item again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| So thank you for being with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| And also we have Boy Scouts Troop 213 from Washington Pike United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=682)|

| 0:11:40| We appreciate you being here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| So next Wednesday, March 7th, we'll have our annual employee appreciation luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| Council members, you should have gotten an invite to that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| This is for staff and for council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| So if you haven't been, those are the new ones who haven't been to it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| It's our annual opportunity to recognize our longest-serving employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| people who are marking 20 years with the city or more, and also our recent retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| So we thank them for their service and their dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| It's always a really nice event if you can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| And it's always great when council members come to show their appreciation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| As you all know, the city of Knoxville is a service organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| and this luncheon is just a small way of expressing our appreciation to the women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| and the men who provide that service day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=751)|

| 0:13:16| Yes, as the mayor mentioned, I am the city council appointee to the Community Health Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| which serves Knox County, the city of Knoxville, and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| We want to thank you for your support and your interest of our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| We just want to give you a brief update on the Community Health Council's Community Health Improvement Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| The Community Health Improvement Plan is our roadmap for improving four priority health issues in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| and those are mental health, opioid abuse, tobacco use, and active living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| Those priorities were identified through the Community Health Assessment, which was conducted in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Both of those documents can be found at HealthyKnox.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| and you also have received a copy of our update, or you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| The effort that we have for the Community Health Improvement Plan spans from 2016 to 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| and we have four local organizations that are working hard in each of the areas that we've identified as priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| So our update is that over the past year we've had partners who have improved their data collection and communication efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| supported prevention efforts, and worked for policy changes among many other activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| Some of the improvements that we have seen trending include a decrease in adult suicide rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| a decrease in amount of opioids prescribed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| decrease in the number of babies born dependent on drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| a decrease in smoking rate among youth and pregnant women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| This does not include vaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| We passed out the 2017 annual report with more details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| and if you have questions you can check HealthyKnox.org or contact us at knoxchc.gmail.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| We have no specific asks for you at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| We just want to make you aware of the Community Health Improvement Plan and our progress toward its goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| and we look forward to any opportunities to work together that may arise from the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=890)|

| 0:22:57| In terms of zoning, the I3 zoning in that area is limited to the property owned by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1377)|

| 0:23:17| Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| A lot on the corner of North Central and Depot is zoned I3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| The railroad tracks are zoned I3, but there's no other I3 zoning in that immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1403)|

| 0:23:44| Depot Street in an easterly direction to allow more intense development, mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| And that's what we're seeing in that area, more interest in mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| So we're seeing a trend away from heavier use and more to a lighter use that included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| And the Magnolia Avenue corridor plan, which was prepared and adopted in 2009, recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1443)|
| 0:24:11| that mixed-use character of the area and identifies it as an area for mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1451)|
| 0:24:19| If we move above C3, that would be inconsistent with this trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| That's a challenging one because those higher level, the C4, C6 districts allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| In fact, C6 now, although this use would not be permitted there, C6 allows mixed-use and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1483)|

| 0:24:51| Both C3 and C6 allow residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Allows a different type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| The Magnolia Avenue corridor plan was pretty general in its approach, looking more at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| form of development than the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| In fact, it recommended a form zoning for that area, which seemed to be pretty typical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| of plans done during that time period, in that a form zone was recommended for just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| about every place there was a corridor plan done during that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| So again, more the form of development was addressed by the plans rather than the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Could use heavier than C3 inhibit the trend towards mixed-use in that area, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| investments that have already been made, particularly those with regard to residential units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| The C4 would not allow the residential component of the mixed-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| Would it be typical if you had a higher use like that with surrounding residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| that you'd have some kind of barrier in between those two areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| Typically a buffer of some type would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| How many residential units are we talking about in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| That I'm not sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| The closest and most recent one is Regas Square in terms of larger development, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| are a number of redevelopment activities on central and smaller buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| There was one recently that only two or three units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| So they range from the large scale of Regas Square to redevelopment of existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| with two or three residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| So there are residential units that would be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| With regard to C3, you cannot have open storage of equipment or materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| The interpretation in C3 is that the storage has to be very incidental to the primary use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| occupying that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| This is an interpretation by the plans review and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Typically that storage or outdoor material is on a daily basis brought inside each day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| at the end of each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| If the space that we're talking about had a roof and walls around it and there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| storage materials inside that space, would that correspond with being acceptable under C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| That would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| That would be an indoor retail facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| So there is a solution here of remaining C3 if we basically have an indoor solution as opposed to just a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1644)|
| 0:27:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| I think that's all I have for right now, and I think I'll pass it to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Councilwoman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| I would be interested also hearing from the property owner because I would like for us to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| that I know what our plans are with Magnolia Corridor, with the streetscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| but I also think that we would be remiss if we do not take into consideration businesses such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| that have been part of the fabric of our community for over 39 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| and have been good business partners and stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| I know there's been a lot of communication regarding this particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| and so I would like to defer and hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| So, Mr. Seymour, do you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Arthur G. Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| I am here on behalf of Knox Rail Salvage, Mr. Frazier, and the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| As Councilman McKenzie pointed out, this is an older business that has survived the downturns in downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1714)|
| 0:28:43| and is looking forward to reaping the upturn in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| Our law firm has been downtown for 110 years, so it's a legacy business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| I like downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| We've been here in good times and hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| Fortunately, good times are back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| They are changing their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| I think Mr. Piper has talked to a number of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| If you look at the business model now, it is not salvage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Most of it is first-run goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| If you go into the old building, you'll see merchandise similar to what you would find at a Lowe's, Ace, or Home Depot store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1756)|
| 0:29:27| They do have this outdoor material, which is simply laying out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| They want to take it off the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| It is right now on and located on the lot they're asking for the rezoning on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| so they can put a parking lot there where it is now for their customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| Their business is increasing because downtown is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| There is a place for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| There's a place for Knox Rail Salvage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| There's a place for O.P. Jenkins Furniture, which seems to be doing very well now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| Vine Furniture, and other retail outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| I think all these type of businesses should be encouraged in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| We can go into the specifics, and I think Mr. Piper has with you all in discussing what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| The area would certainly be well-screened where the material would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| It is not well-screened now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| He's trying to bring this property up where it's more first-run merchandise rather than salvage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| They are putting in a kitchen shop, for you all who went down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| in the old White Lily Flower Company where customers and contractors can come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| and select cabinets, appliances, and so forth for their home remodeling or new homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| So the business is undergoing just like downtown rehabilitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| and I think we certainly support the motion to refer this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| because we would like to have further discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Mr. Swanson's office and I disagree on whether C-3 would support the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| We are seeking for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| Maybe with further discussion we might come to some agreement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| That would avoid the whole controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| I somehow doubt it at this point, but anyway, we always like to discuss these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| and see if there is some non-confrontational remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| Our clients want to be part of the renaissance of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| since they've been here, as Councilwoman McKenzie pointed out, for a good long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| I'd just like to point out, I think it's important when we look at mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| because that's where we're taking the discussion, that it includes a lot of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| which includes residential but also places to shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| When you look at other cities, I think of Atlanta, they have their Ikea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| You can go from your downtown residences there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| and go buy your kitchen cabinets and stuff at a place like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| That's one of the few places in that downtown area you can buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| I live loosely, I'm saying walking distance from the Ace Hardware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| that's new to the Broadway Shopping Center off Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| Prior to that Ace opening, my options for buying any kind of hardware or supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| were to go outside the Beltway, if you want to call it that here, to a Home Depot or Lowe's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| or to go to Knox Rail Salvage, which I have done in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| to purchase things for home renovation or even a plunger when needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| because that's really the closest place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| And so I think, I know that sounds funny, but it's a needed thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| I think it's important that we talk about walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| and we talk about reducing congestion and traffic that we maintain places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| and this is a longstanding business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| And what I see from going to the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| I think the industrial zoning is a historic designation that was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| and that's not what they're doing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| though the word salvage is in the name of their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| By the definition of our code, they are not doing a salvage business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| They are a commercial retail business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| and the plans that have been presented are to kind of modernize the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| and focus on the commercial use that will benefit the areas around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| including the near suburbs north and east and south as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| And so I think there should be, I think the industrial zoning struck me as odd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| not necessarily the right designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| because what they're doing in their overall property is not industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| So what's the right commercial designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| And when I look at it in talking to the building department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| is the possibility of a C-4 zoning could fit there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| or what can happen to make a C-3, which is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| And then, of course, we've opened up the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| as to whether any of the property should be industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| but that's a whole other ball of wax because they're not industrial at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Mr. Seymour, would your client, two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| One, I think the idea of pushing businesses out that have been always there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| or for 30-plus years in order for new growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| and that's something that we're all working on in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Two, would the C-4 designation feel comfortable for your client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| and what would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I think based on conversations with Mr. Green and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| C-4 would certainly work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| We would do fencing, landscaping to screen the storage from the surrounding public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2090)|
| 0:34:58| MPC has standards for the screening and landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| and I think you all fully intend to comply with that at a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| The business is undergoing renovation change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| In business, you've got to change if you're going to survive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| and they want to move with the times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| and they certainly want to make it an attractive place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| It was an old industrial building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| and that's what all of the businesses along the tracks were down there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| That's undergoing change now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| I'd first just like to say that I concur with Councilwoman Ryder's assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| and understanding of what we're looking for in a mixed-use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| and that is a variety of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| So certainly my understanding of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| and the way it's sort of conceptualized is that it fits in with my understanding of mixed-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| I guess my question, and this may be for Mr. Green, it may be for Mr. Brace, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| What kind of assurance would there be if this were to be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| and if there were design guidelines that were part of the plan that's submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| what kind of assurance can be made to the surrounding businesses and investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| that those plans will be complied with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| So if there are screening requirements or landscaping requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| what's the compliance arm of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| The condition would be placed on the zoning to be recommended by MPC, approved by this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| The plans would have to be submitted to plans review and inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| showing that buffer, landscaping, strip, fencing, or a combination of those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| Prior to issuance of permit to develop this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| that landscaping or other buffer would have to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| If at any time it were removed or not maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| the owners would receive a notice of violation from the plans review and inspections department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| If they did not then reinstall that buffer, they could be fined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| or ultimately the business could be shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| So I guess if we're discussing referring this back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| my comment or my sort of input back to MPC is to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| the commissioner's discussion includes the intent of mixed use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| which is around sort of this design towards pedestrians and the surrounding community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| sort of integrated into the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| I feel certain that that's what would happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| but I just want to throw my two cents in that that would be part of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| in MPC's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| It will be part and just maybe somewhat appropriate to this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| As we work on a new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| we are working with the consultants to develop a mixed use industrial district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| that would allow some level of manufacturing, retail, residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| and buffering standards within that and reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| to ensure that those uses are compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Well, mixed use is mixed use, and it's mixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| and that's the whole point of having mixed use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| My motion is just to send it back to MPC to consider C-4 with the appropriate screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| and, as he has outlined in the email that he sent to us, to reconsider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2330)|
| 0:38:58| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| The motion is to send back to MPC to consider C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| With the appropriate screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Having asked it, if that's what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| if we ask it to go back to be considered for C-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| does that preclude it being considered for anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| We will look at all options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| C-4 would certainly be the primary one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| and seems to be the one that works at this point based on our review to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| but we will look at all options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| I see where this is going, but I have some real concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| First, I've never seen anything like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| where the staff recommends to support a rezoning for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| and the entire commission unanimously votes against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2396)|
| 0:40:03| There's a range of opinions on MPC commission, as we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| That, to me, was a strong signal, and it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| I like rail salvage, and I want them to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| Really, when we look at this, we need to look, I mean, what's our vision for the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| What do we want that area to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| I think that's what MPC commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| they clearly thought an expansion of an industrial zone was inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| So now the motion is on the floor for a C-4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| The problem with that, I mean, C-4 is an arterial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| I mean, if you just read the first sentence, it's made for high-speed motor traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| It's really not appropriate for that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| And really, more to the point, it's a question of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| we want nocturnal salvage to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| but really what this is is just an expansion of outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| And so is outdoor storage a use we want in what's really now part of our downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| I have, you know, I don't think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| I don't think we'd want other parcels of downtown to be permitted for outdoor storage of salvage material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2472)|
| 0:41:21| This doesn't mean, you know, I don't want nocturnal salvage to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| They've got a current location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| They own different properties around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| You know, you can store properties in other locations and move them in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| So I'm not comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| You know, I think the MPC Commission was unanimously not comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| So I'm going to have to vote against the motion to send it back for C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| So this is just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Are we going to vote on the motion to go back to MPC for C-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| If we're just finished, then we will vote on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Mr. Seymour, I wanted to say that I definitely want to see NoxRail Salvage be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2525)|
| 0:42:13| and I want them to continue to be a productive business partner in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| The issue that I see is that the business is in transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| That was very clear from the visit that I had where I saw just some really fantastic changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| they were making for having floor models for kitchens and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| The issue I see is that the trend is not to heavier use, but it's to lesser use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| You know, certainly the industrial zone was out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| I'm concerned that the C-4, just like Councilman Stair was, that the C-4 is out of order as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2566)|
| 0:42:55| Just read the first sentence in what C-4 is, and it tells you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| So what I'm asking you is if we're going to make a long-term change to this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| and change the zoning up, which is against what the trend is in the heaviness of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| why are we doing that in a business that's transitioning away from that business model in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| Because first, right now the storage is out there in the open, as you can see, and can remain there in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2600)|
| 0:43:30| What they're trying to do is clean up the property, put orderly parking in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| sort of disorderly right now, and move the storage to this particular lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| where it can be screened from anything but drones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| And that's the next step in what they're doing with their property down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| Unfortunately, the zoning ordinance of the City of Knoxville does not have an appropriate zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| I would say C-3 would allow this, and we wouldn't even be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| Unfortunately, the city disagrees with me on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| so the only other zone we know that's available is C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| Now, the preamble says it's for arterial highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| The uses of C-4 and C-3 are very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| The only difference and the one that gets the flack is C-4 allows car lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| Mike Fraser does not have a car dealer's license, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| And nobody over there does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| They do not intend to sell cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| That's why it gets a bad rap because of Clinton Highway, certain areas of Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| and certain areas of Chapman Highway that are zoned C-4 and have buy-here, pay-here car lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| That is not their intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| We're simply looking for a commercial zone that would permit an orderly transition of this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| and C-4 is unfortunately it until you all adopt the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| which I think you'll see the first draft of sometime later this year but will not benefit them in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2707)|
| 0:45:16| Well, from the previous discussion, it was determined that your proposal is basically switching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| where the parking lot is currently and where the storage is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| The drawings that I recall seeing showed a building with a roof that you were putting above the storage area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| and the discussion previously was showing that if there were some level of wall around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| then you could continue to do what you're doing and you don't have to change from C-3 at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| And so what I'm asking is that you consider that as a potential solution so that we don't have to have a trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2744)|
| 0:45:53| that's going heavier use in this particular instance that's against the trend that we're seeing in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| which is obviously growing right now and there's a lot of investment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| As is Knox Rail South, because they are increasing their investment in that area too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| Mr. Seymour, this is I don't think our purview to ask this in this venue or to attach it to a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2775)|
| 0:46:25| but thinking over the comments that have been made here, I wonder if looking at the overall plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| and the long-term plans of the business, the fact that the industrial zone doesn't reflect the overall plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| for the area, the 10-year plans, the one-year plans, the sector plans, the business plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| would it be a consideration when you go back to MPC looking at whether it's C-4 or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2801)|
| 0:46:50| to also look at the zoning on the entirety of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Because when you have a block or two there that's industrial zone that's not a reflection of what the business is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| or what the overall plans are for the area, it allows tomorrow a sale could occur where you could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2821)|
| 0:47:09| industrial uses like what you have in the middle of Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| They're not appropriate next to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Or an hibiscus plant that could set up shop, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| So I wonder if in this overall movement to change this and to improve the property that there be also a movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| to change the zoning on the rest of the property as well as kind of bring everything into compliance, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2847)|
| 0:47:37| Mr. Fraser is here. He will take those remarks into consideration and I'll discuss it with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| The problem with doing an overall master plan is with your new zoning ordinance you're going to remap the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2864)|
| 0:47:55| And that will probably be coming within a year or so, so you've got to weigh that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| Do you want to do it now or wait because you all are going to change it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| True story. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| I would like to say that we do have the plans that were attached in an e-mail that we received of what the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| currently looks like versus what the proposed plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| Are these final drafts or are these just proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| Please state your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| My name is Joel Piper, 6116 Montrachet Avenue, speaking on behalf of Mike Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| I want to thank you all for coming out. I met all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| I want you to hear from me, kind of hear where my heart is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| I'm a citizen of Knoxville, so I'm not happy with a lot of the way it looks either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| I'm 51 years old. I'm going to work a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| It's going to look better, but I've got a 4,000 square foot lot on that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| I think I showed it to you. I'm going to speak to Marshall and Andrew because they seem to have the most questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| We've got 4,000 square feet on that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| We've got this lot with 21,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| We can leave that corner just like it is because it's I-3. It looks terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| Or you can meet us halfway and help us get the right zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| and we'll get all that stuff that's sitting out there that's terrible from a pedestrian viewpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| and we'll put it behind the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| We think that's an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I know you all are the ones asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| All we want to do is use our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| I mean, I can roll through a bunch of facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| We generate over a million dollars in sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| Our annual payroll is $1.45 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| All those things, you can't just make these decisions in vacuums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| We've been here 39 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| He's poured his heart and soul into this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| You know, we were downtown when it wasn't cool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| and if the people want to control downtown, they should have been here 39 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| But we're not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| We're going to be there unless somebody writes a check for about $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| So we're going to be there because we're successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| And if you want to know about our brand, go look at our Google reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| We've got 80 reviews with a 4.3 rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| I look at all my competitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| I think other than Home Depot or Lowe's, they're big boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| I don't think they have more than 20 reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| And I want to thank the mayor publicly for her business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| I see her in there, and I see a few others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| So you can get a hammer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| You can get a tape measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| You can get a plunger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| You can get a what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Plunger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| You can get a plunger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| That was probably your husband's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| Anyway, you know, we feel like we're making an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| I mean, you know, I've been here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| I'm a UT grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| I got an MBA from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| I know what shareholders are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| It's not just me and Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Every one of you all is a shareholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| I get the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| We're not blind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| We're business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| We're about making money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| We're not just about selling floors or cabinets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| We're about if we can sell land, we'll sell land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| We want to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| And we're going to do our growth in a way that's compatible with the improvements in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| I mean, that's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| We just want to use our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| That's a land use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| And, you know, narrow-mindedness and all that is not popular in our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| I'm asking you all, don't take a narrow view of what businesses can be downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| Be more inclusive, if I can use that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| That's what I want you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| Because I've showed every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| The last mayor came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Thank you very much for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| I've spoken with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| And, you know, we could get out of the lumber business, but it's hard just to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| You know, when you've been doing something for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| So we want to shrink it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| We want to have more of a boutique where people can come through and get a three-quarter plywood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| which is predominantly what subfloors are, seven-sixteenths OSBs on the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| We don't want to have every skew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| We want to narrow it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| But we don't want to just get away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| We bring a lot of people to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| People come in and say, where do I go eat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| I say, well, go to the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| And they drive from Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| They drive from Athens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| They drive from Johnson City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| I mean, we're a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| You know, we spend $280,000 a year on advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| Mr. Lee over at Channel 10, he likes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| We're contributing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| We're not some horse going out to pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| You may think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| I mean, I want to paint you a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| We're a young stallion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| We're jumping around the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| We're getting ready to grow big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| And you've seen the kitchen gallery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| There's nothing like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| And it's not going to probably have the same name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| It's going to be something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Because I don't really want salvage when I'm selling first quality cabinets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| It's going to be some kind of old city kitchen gallery or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| And we'll have a ribbon cutting at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| And I want to invite you all down to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| But we're just trying to improve the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| And, you know, two weeks ago, people had a problem with the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| So we said, okay, as long as we can do our business, we'll go C4, whatever commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| Now it seems like, well, C's not good either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| So we're starting to think they just don't want us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| But we're going to be there, and we're going to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| So I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| Any questions, I'll open the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| I don't mean to sound preachy, but we're passionate about our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| We work hard at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| And we appreciate your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| And what I don't want you to walk away with is feeling that we don't appreciate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| that we don't want you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| I do think that you guys have come up with some very attractive plans, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| and anybody that's gone down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Downtown was not, at one point, the place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| And it was, you know, if it looked the way that it looked in these pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| well, nobody thought twice about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| At least you guys recognize that we are now expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| We're growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| You're trying to change with the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| And you have presented a plan that I think is appealing and is attractive that would be inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3251)|
| 0:54:19| And very impressive with the kitchen gallery that you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| And so you are continuing to invest in our downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| And as we talk about mixed use, I'm in total agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| And also what we don't want to do, or what I never want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| is make businesses that have invested in our community and in downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| when downtown was not the cool place to be feel that they are no longer wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| or appreciated in our city because that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| And so I am definitely in favor of going back and looking at the C4 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| or something that would be conducive to comply with the plans that you all have submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| And as far as the NPC committee, I didn't speak to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| I didn't call Jeff or Scott and say this is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| I think some of the opposition may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| We got slaughtered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| He said, I wish I'd have known that was you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| I would have spoke up for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| So we didn't play the political game because we had a staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| and they recommended industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| And now we're backing off to C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| We feel like that's the right zoning, and we're good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| We hope you all can find it in your heart to see that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| Let's call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| I was going to ask Councilman Wallace if he'd accept a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| to return this to NPC to consider remaining at C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| or if C4 would be appropriate for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| I think that would kind of encompass everything we've discussed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| The truth is it doesn't really matter what you ask NPC to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| They're going to consider the gamut of available options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| Obviously, if there is a particular one that you want them to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| that you want them to make sure the record shows that it's considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| then you might include that in your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| Otherwise, it's merely surplusage to say what particular zoning category you're interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3370)|
| 0:56:17| because it's NPC's obligation to consider whatever zoning designation they deem to be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| and they should examine all that have the potential for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Thank you, Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| This is no slight to Knoxville Salvage or my good friend Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| In response to Councilmember McKenzie's reference to a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| please note that this is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| When this comes before you, any use permitted in that zoning district is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| It cannot be conditioned upon a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| We will try to attach conditions with regard to screening and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| to the extent that Mr. Swanson and his staff will allow us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| and I make this comment about once a month with the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| that plans submitted as part of a rezoning request mean nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| Once the property is rezoned, it can be used for any use there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| and again, we will work with Knoxville Salvage just like we do any other applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| to meet the intent as closely as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| but there are limits on the conditions that can be placed on a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Okay, so are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| We had good, full discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| so this is the motion to send back to NPC to consider C-4 or whatever is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| So the motion passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| 11A is a resolution respectfully requesting that the members of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| Legislative Delegation oppose efforts to undo local short-term rental ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| that were developed through an open public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| and are reflective of compromise between varying interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| and deliver on behalf of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| all documents necessary to transfer to Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| one parcel of real property located at 2401 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| at no cost pursuant to the five points comprehensive redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| with Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| for Phase 3 Part 2 site infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| at the Walter P. Taylor Homes site along McConnell Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| Kenner Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| as part of the five points revitalization project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| in an amount not to exceed $630,774.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| I just wanted to ask a question of Ms. Wade or Mr. Bentley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| whoever wanted to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| As we're adding units to these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| where are the folks that are waiting to be housed in them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| Like where do they live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| We have a lot of waiting lists, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| My understanding is, yes, they do have waiting lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Phase 3 is completely cleared out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| That's where Lee Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| and a section of Walter P. Taylor Homes was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| Those residents moved into Phase 1, which was finished last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| That was 90 units of elderly and disabled housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| So they are housed there at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| So all those units were vacant before they were taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| So KCDC, they operate the waiting list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| so there are hundreds to thousands of folks waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| Ben Bentley is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| He can probably address the size of the waiting list better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| I just want to make sure the public understands the need and the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| that there is more need than we can actually provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| I think it's important to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| Ben Bentley, 458 East Hillville Turn, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| I'm still learning my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| So, yes, our waiting lists are significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| We actually have site-based waiting lists, so they vary from site to site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| But at any given time, we have thousands of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| on both our public housing waiting lists, so our physical properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| and our housing choice voucher waiting lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| So it's very appropriate to categorize the need in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| as a very high demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| And so we're just meeting a small amount of the need with projects like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Thank you, Mr. Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| 11D is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| with the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| for the Atlantic Avenue sidewalk project for an estimated cost of $1,050,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| with TDOT funding $840,000 and the city funding $210,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| Very gladly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| I wanted to ask Mr. Hagerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| help us understand how this particular got to a top priority is my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3710)|
| 1:01:59| And secondly, it's surprising a little bit to see TDOT funding this sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| and I kind of wanted to get the reasoning and how that came about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| As many of you are aware, we do maintain a prioritization list of sidewalk projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3736)|
| 1:02:23| This is at the current time based on requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| And this particular one scored very high based on the fact that it's in three separate PRZs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3749)|
| 1:02:38| Parental Responsibility Zones, where the houses are too close to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| for the schools to provide bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| That is to say it's in grade school, middle school, and high school PRZs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3769)|
| 1:02:58| It gets some points for being a missing link, but it's a very long section of sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| so it doesn't score high on missing link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| Medium pedestrian usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| It's a R2 district with small lots, so it's more dense than R1 suburban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3788)|
| 1:03:21| So there's more potential traffic generated, and it's got commercial district at one end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3801)|
| 1:03:29| So it doesn't get maximum points because it doesn't have high-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| but it's got more than some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| It's a collector, so it gets more points than a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| It does have a CAT route on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| It's the CAT Route 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| Lincoln Park goes right up that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| This sidewalk will provide access to three different CAT stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| It has 13 points, which ties with five before it came off the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3839)|
| 1:04:08| since it's going to get constructed, so it comes off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| But when it was still on the list, it was tied with five others at 13 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| I want to add on this that last budget year, you recall, we quadrupled the money for sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| and brought it up to $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| And so when we did that, I asked our engineering department to look at that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| and to pick the top project in each district except the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| because we had several other sidewalk and infrastructure projects going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| And you may not remember, but we mailed those out to you sometime after the budget passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| But we looked in each district and picked the highest score that was practical for the money that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| And I think we talked with some of you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| And so that's why Atlantic was high for that district, for the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| It was either the highest or among the highest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| And you have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Some might be equal and cost significantly more money than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| And so our engineering staff looked at that and came up with some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| And that's why you'll see several of these projects coming forward now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| And this particular one was on the transportation planning organization's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| transportation improvement project list for federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| And we have sought out the high-priority projects that are over a million dollars for that kind of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3943)|
| 1:05:53| So it really stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| It helps us extend our money when we can get the state dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| But we look for the bigger projects because there is enough hoops to jump through that it really only becomes worth it with the bigger projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3961)|
| 1:06:12| Yeah, I think that's just real important to remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| And we get asked this a lot about priority of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| I'm very pleased, I'm sure everybody is, that we're commissioning a study that we'll have sometime in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| to really be able to analyze that and to look at each one of these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| and to be in three PRZ zones and Cat Route, Collector Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| It's got a double yellow stripe down the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| I mean, it's a well-intended and I was unaware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| I think there is sidewalks on both sides of Atlantic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| And your plan is to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| There's some that's very old and mudded over almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| There's only a couple of sections that are visible on aerial photography anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| There's one block on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| And there's a short section that's at the Johnson and Galleon operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| But that's on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| So that doesn't necessarily come into our design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| And I'm not sure which side the designers have decided to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| But it looks like the north side has some more right-of-way to work with than the south side does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| So will you improve the Cat stops on Atlantic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| I don't think we've gotten to the point to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| Right now we're just talking about the sidewalk itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| But we will have a chat with Cat about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| And the crosswalks as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| Crosswalks will be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| And so how did TDOT come about to fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| How did that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| It's part of the transportation planning organization planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| There are several buckets of money that can be spent on pedestrian projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4069)|
| 1:07:57| And we tapped into one of those buckets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| Great job. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| It's good to let people know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Thank you for asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to amend contract number C-17-0210| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4098)|

| 1:08:30| increasing the contract amount by $46,718.33| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4110)|

| 1:08:46| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Yeah, well, I think it's important to note on this one as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| and continuing that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| this is one that we voted on a little over a year ago, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| Or has that been maybe longer than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| But it is one that's been under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| We voted on it before, and we're just voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| It's almost done, right, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| This is really the closeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| Make all the account for all of the changes that we made during the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4148)|

| 1:10:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| I just wanted to ask Mr. Hageman, so this particular agenda item has the list of different roads in our districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4252)|
| 1:11:01| divided by district, because there's kind of an equity paving per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| What ends up on that list each year for paving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| Is it kind of like the sidewalk system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| How does a road get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| I have a lot of constituents that will ask me, when is this road getting paved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| And actually the three that I've been asked about are actually on this list, like magically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| So how do they get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| You really know how to deliver for your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| I'm here to work for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| We evaluate every street in the city on a two-year cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| and if people complain about a particular street, we will go out and evaluate to see if there's any short-term measures we can take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4295)|
| 1:11:44| In general, a local street gets paved about once every 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| a collector gets paved about every 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| and an arterial gets paved about every 10 years, depending a lot on what's going on with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| utilities and utility cuts and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| But that's the general rule of thumb that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| But there is an evaluation process, and we try to keep up on that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| Okay, and one last moderately related question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| So when you guys go and pave, so these are scheduled to be paved this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Oh, I'm sorry, I lost my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| The manholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Then that gets communicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| You guys do your stuff, and then when do the manholes get raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| Because there was a recent example actually right next to Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| where the manhole had for a long term not been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| and KUB came through and did that and patched around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| It just was an issue to me because it's on my way to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| and we actually have Pellissippi students that were flattening their tires on it on the first day of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| because they didn't know to drive around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| So I just wanted to know about the coordination of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| In general, it's part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| You will find as one of the bid items in here is adjusting the height of manhole covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| And if something gets overlooked, then we have a one-year warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| But it isn't KUB's responsibility unless they come in later and change something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| It is the responsibility of the paving contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Oh, to raise those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Yeah, to adjust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| I mean, sometimes they get lowered because they mill away more pavement than they put back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| But usually they stay pretty close, but there's frequently some minor adjustments that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4407)|
| 1:13:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| with the State of Tennessee Department of Transportation for a citywide sidewalk study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| for an estimated cost of $200,000 with TDOT funding $160,000 and the city funding $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4431)|
| 1:13:59| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| I was just going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| I'm thrilled, first of all, to see that we're voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| I know that we all get questions at every single neighborhood meeting about sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| So to have a nice logical methodology for going about prioritizing sidewalks I think will be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4454)|
| 1:14:23| Can you tell us a little bit about what the process will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| I realize that this is TDOT funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| Will we be contracting this work out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| Will we be doing it in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Sort of what will be happening from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| It will be led by city staff, but the footwork will be done by a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4477)|
| 1:14:44| And one thing that I should emphasize with both this one and the Atlantic project is that this contract is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4484)|
| 1:14:55| We can't get started on anything until this contract is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| Once the contract is in place, we can go advertise for a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| But there's two goals, two general philosophical goals here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| One is examining the need for sidewalks as a system instead of short segment by short segment out of the context of the whole system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4511)|
| 1:15:23| And the other is getting some more consensus on what the prioritization, what rules we use to choose the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4523)|
| 1:15:34| And so there's going to be a public process involved in vetting the prioritization criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4534)|
| 1:15:44| But also network analysis, probably some survey, public survey tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4544)|
| 1:15:53| It hasn't really – we'll have to look at their proposals before we really nail down the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4553)|
| 1:16:01| But that's the way I see it happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| But the final product is a prioritized list of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| We can get a clearer scope of where we're going as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| And it makes it easier to plan from the financial perspective if you know exactly what you've got out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4574)|
| 1:16:24| Right now if you look at the whole city, build out the sidewalk system, it would cost several billion dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4584)|
| 1:16:32| So clearly there's a prioritization that has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| And so this is to clarify that with a big picture look at the whole network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4595)|
| 1:16:46| So we'll get a report at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| There will be a report available for us to look at that will kind of outline all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4617)|

| 1:18:16| with a required local match of $416,250 for a total grant of $1,650,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4696)|
| 1:18:25| to expand programs that divert adults with a serious mental illness or co-occurring disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| from the criminal justice system to community-based services prior to arrest and booking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| We have a person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Do you want to speak first, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Is there somebody here to speak on this grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| I can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| I'm very excited that we're applying for these grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Can you tell me some about what these monies are going to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| I'm Deputy Chief Miller, Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| This grant, actually item L, if you want to talk about both of them, is an ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| We currently have three victim advocates in our Family Justice Center, and they are grant funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| This will be a continuation of their current grant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| We would like to get four, but realistically we think we'll get about three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| but we're going to ask for four to add one more over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| So that's what that one will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| The other one will be a contract, an agreement with Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| whereby we're applying for it, but they'll be heavily involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| What we'll be doing is working closely with them to provide outpatient services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| and ongoing case management to people who have no other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| So that would be some of your homeless who need mental treatment on a number of levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4786)|
| 1:19:53| and also substance abuse treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| And we'll be able to work with them and have this as a resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| and also have a dedicated caseworker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| It'll provide for one full-time, master's level mental health provider at Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| One thing I want to say is it's going to be distinct and separate from the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| It will not have anything to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Now, I'm going to say they'll never collaborate on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| I'm not willing to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| But that currently is not the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| Do you know how the caseworker will be used, what calls he or she will go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| Well, they'll be on call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| They'll be only one, so they can't work 24-7 with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| So they can't be emergency access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| It'll be more of an ongoing case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| We can refer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Of course, we do have officers now that have received extensive training in mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| And they'll be working closely with that group of officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| to go out and work with folks that we believe that we can help and assist on a number of levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| No, I'm impressed by this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| because I think police officers are expected to do a whole lot of social work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| and a lot of mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| and some of these monies are going to be going towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| I think it'll relieve that workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| Yeah, well, Captain Miller, I'll just go back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| So none of this money, if we were awarded it on M,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| would go to the Urgent Care Behavioral Center or the safety center, as you call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| None of it is designed to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| It's not designed, and that's not the direction we want to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| Okay, we have one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Barbara Cooke signed up to speak against L11M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| Mrs. Cooke, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| As you know, I'll set the timer, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4904)|
| 1:21:52| My name is Barbara Cooke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| I live at 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| Tonight I'm asking the City Council to delay approval of Resolution M| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| until such time as additional, more specific information is made available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| regarding the details of this partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| Conspicuously absent from the material contained in the packet is the grant description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| which would give one some idea of what the expectations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| for the use of these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| A description of the program, which would give one some idea of how the expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| are expected to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| What indicators will be used to determine whether the expectations have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| successfully met, that is, how will success be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| And last, but certainly not least, how the money will be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| That is to say, who's getting the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| It should be noted that this is not the first grant-funded partnership of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| i.e. jail diversion, that the police department has been a party to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| From October 2013 through September 2016, they partnered with Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4992)|
| 1:23:19| in an early diversion grant award of $966,666.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=4999)|
| 1:23:27| Though I have asked multiple times for the details of whether this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| was deemed to be a success, the most I've been able to uncover is that the key components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| of that program were peer involvement and ride-alongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| Additionally, though the initial goals of the program included diversion of 1,250 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5024)|
| 1:23:53| from entering jail through early diversion liaison outreach during the three-year grant cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5033)|
| 1:24:01| and provision of extensive case management services to 175 individuals during the full grant cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5041)|
| 1:24:10| the only metrics I could get reflected only 265 unique individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5050)|
| 1:24:19| and 57 enrolled in case management over the three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| Suffice it to say that there were obviously scope and goal changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| during the three years this grant covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| This evening, I do not have the time to go into the many philosophical reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| why this type of program may not be the best solution for people with a serious mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5079)|
| 1:24:46| or a co-occurring disorder, other than to say that these problems will not be solved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5086)|
| 1:24:54| by throwing money at them from this source or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| Which, by the way, no matter how you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| it's all tax money that's being thrown at these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| No, I'd rather just say that there are too many unanswered questions about this partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| to enable approval by this body at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| Please ask the police department to provide more detail before making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| Counsel, I just will advise you this is to apply for the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| and if, in fact, we receive the funds, then there will be a contract which would come back to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| which would detail some of the things she's mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| that then you can review those before approving it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Okay, so that's the end of our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| We're at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| We have several people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| First on the list is Mrs. Cook again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| Once again, please state your name and address for the record, and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| It's Barbara Cook, 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| My purpose for being here at the public forum is to read into your record the e-mail that I sent you earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5179)|
| 1:26:27| regarding the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center, and it goes like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5187)|
| 1:26:34| In explaining his double bogey on the 18th hole of the first round at the Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5194)|
| 1:26:42| Rory McIlroy offered the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| Well, it was a great shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| I just didn't execute it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| Attached with this e-mail are the operating procedures from Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| for the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| A review of these procedures should lead anyone who thought that a jail diversion facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| was just what was needed in Knoxville to a similar conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| Well, it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| It's just not being executed properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| What was supposed to be a jail diversion facility for those with mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| has morphed into a wing in an expensive, expansive building financed by the city, the county, and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5241)|
| 1:27:30| so that Helen Ross McNabb can expand their crisis stabilization treatment facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| Facilities that will allow access and egress by the general public mixed in with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5257)|

| 1:27:53| Presumably, police and sheriff's department personnel have been and are being given crisis intervention training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5273)|
| 1:28:02| to assist them in recognizing candidates eligible for jail diversion in this wing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| There is no indication that those employed at this facility have been given any training in managing patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5289)|
| 1:28:17| who are confined, as if in jail, until successfully completing the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5297)|
| 1:28:24| This is just one of the many questions that concerned neighbors have raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| after having reviewed the proposed procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| These questions are also attached to this email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| The Knoxville Office of Neighborhoods has agreed to set up a meeting between the principal players involved with the BHUCC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| and community members as soon as possible, given their schedule and staffing constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| We thank them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| This meeting was adjourned as early as March 16th, with many important safety issues still not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5339)|
| 1:29:06| Two of the primary players responsible for the existence of this facility in its present location and form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5346)|
| 1:29:14| are term limited and are moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| The rest of you are still here and have a job to do and a responsibility to citizens and taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| Rory McIlroy headed back to the driving range and practice ground to work hard and do all he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5365)|
| 1:29:34| to improve his game so he can properly execute those very important golf shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5374)|
| 1:29:42| What, if I may be so bold to ask, what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| We are not getting responses from Helen Ross McNabb to the questions we raise about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5388)|
| 1:29:56| As a matter of fact, we're kind of being excluded totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| They are planning a private, mind you, private neighborhood preview of the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5401)|
| 1:30:10| Invitation only. Can you imagine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| It's a private neighborhood and we haven't been invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| I just want you to know that you give money to people who are supposed to be doing a good job for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5420)|
| 1:30:30| One of the things that they could do is communicate with the people that are their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| They're not doing a good job of that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| Next up is Selina Capps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| Thank you for being here. Please state your name and address for the record and I'll set the timer and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you. My name is Selina Capps. My address is 10021 Bluegrass Road, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| I am here to speak upon gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| According to their statistics, where someone in a car had brandished a gun in a threatening manner or fired a gun at another driver or passenger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| had more than doubled from 247 in 2014 to 620 in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| There were 1,319 road rage episodes involving firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5478)|
| 1:31:49| Nationwide, at least 354 people were wounded and 136 people killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5509)|
| 1:31:58| A 2006 study of aggressive drivers by researchers from the Harvard Study Control Research Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5518)|
| 1:32:06| found that drivers with a firearm in their vehicle may be more prone to anger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| and more likely to engage in aggressive driving than those who did not have a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5532)|
| 1:32:20| Across all demographics and regions, gun carriers were more likely to make obscene gestures at other drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5540)|
| 1:32:28| aggressively follow them, or both, the study concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| States with high carry permits reported the most road rage cases involving guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5554)|
| 1:32:41| Tennessee had 68, which was ranked fourth. Florida was ranked number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5561)|
| 1:32:49| On February the 16th, a 41-year-old Virginia man was arrested after a gun was allegedly pointed from one car at another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5569)|
| 1:32:58| in a suspected road rage. This happened in Laurel, Maryland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| And according to the Maryland State Troopers, once they stopped the vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| they found the driver appeared to be sitting on a handgun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| Once they searched this car, they found an assault rifle, a second rifle, a shotgun, ammunition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5595)|
| 1:33:23| The troopers arrested this driver at the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| With this being said, on February the 14th, while at the intersection of Westland Drive and Morefield Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| I was waiting for the traffic to clear so I could proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| The traffic to my left was clear, so I pulled into the middle lane to turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| There was a Jeep Grand Cherokee still at the stop sign at Morefield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5625)|
| 1:33:52| When I pulled on to the right lane, this angered Mr. Angry Aggressive Driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| He then tried to ram my car, so I slowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| Once I slowed down, he proceeded to shake something at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| I believed it was an alleged gun, so I slowed down even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| This made him even madder, so he decided to pull in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| He passed me on the shoulder at Shoreline Baptist Church, pulled in front of me, stopped his car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| tried to make me ram him, while all at once he was still shaking what I believed was an alleged gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5664)|
| 1:34:32| I followed him onto Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| I called 911. I gave them his license plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| And I had a description as an angry aggressive white male driver waving a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| As a black 55-year-old woman who has never had a gun pulled on her, I was terrified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5687)|
| 1:34:54| I had an angry aggressive white man trying to hit me and trying to make me hit himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5694)|
| 1:35:01| At this point, I had him trapped at Kingston Pike in Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| I told them that I was following him, but they told me not to pursue him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| After waiting 10 minutes for an officer to come to call and help me, no one showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| I finally called back to tell them to forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| After they came out, the officer asked me, was I 100% sure was this a gun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| I was not 100% sure. It was an alleged gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| It looked like a gun to me. And because I was not 100% sure, nothing was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| I do not feel I was treated fairly. I feel that had this been a white woman being chased by an angry black man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| with a gun in Farragut, something would have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| There would have been the highway patrol, there would have been helicopters, there would have been Blount County, there would have been everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| But no, because I was a lonely black female, nothing was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| So Mr. Angry Aggressive White Male Driver is still out there with his gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| I just hope that something is done, because this is not right. I've been to Internal Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| I want to know why someone can brandish a gun and nothing is done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| If you make a call to 911, you want help, and that's what I wanted. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| Next speaker is Danica Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| Hi, my name is Danica Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| I live at 4718 River Oak Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| My name is Danica Kim. I am 14 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| My dad is a former Marine and my mom is a gun owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| She purchased her gun to protect us kids from dogs after my brother was brutally mauled in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| I would never want that right stripped from anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| I am a military grade assault weapon which has no business in the hands of the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| I've been homeschooled for nearly four years and cannot imagine going back to public school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| and knowing the laws that currently exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| I realize this isn't a city issue per se, but it is up to you to come together and figure out a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| to make our streets, parks, schools, and churches safer. Please do not let me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| Next is Jonica Hubbard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| Thank you for being here, too. Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| Hi, my name is Jonica Hubbard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| I live at 2230 Maplewood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| My question is about gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| I'm very aggravated at the fact that schools are talking about gun violence but not doing much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| They're not saying that I don't feel safe all the time, but there are a few things that I would like to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| such as the fact that instead of only having one back check in the first semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| we should have maybe once every month or every nine weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| The real problem is that schools tell us about this stuff and the state tells us about this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| but they're not really doing much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5898)|
| 1:38:23| Something they should do is put stronger laws on guns and who can get guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| Next speaker is Caleb Boyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| My name is Caleb Boyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| I'm the owner of Orchard Entertainment Group, LLC, and doing business as Bar Marley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| I haven't been here since my beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| but I just wanted to kind of touch base with you guys about what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| The principal reason for opening Bar Marley is an aspect of the redevelopment of a region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| that's kind of uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| My background is in restoring historic houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| and one of the things that I would do is to go into a neighborhood that had foreclosure houses like Old North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5953)|
| 1:39:18| I did a number in Old North and a few in Park Ridge and Fourth and Gill there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| and just take the foreclosure, clean it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| show indications of how the curb view of the house can be enhanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| or added value to, and then turn around and sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| I didn't always do that, but that was one of the tactics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| Bar Marley is, at its heart, the same kind of a tactic, only for a commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| Bar Marley, the location there on Stone Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| is between a redeveloped residential area, Old North,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| and the industrial area that's now under heavy redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| with the North Central redevelopment project that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| The tactic is to buy a property, stick the flag in the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| keep the lights on, and throw a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| A multicultural party, because obviously you've got different demographics in regions like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| Reggae music in a Caribbean restaurant just bridges those cultural gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6028)|
| 1:40:36| Obviously, because who could not like reggae and who could not like the beach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| If you could see some of the events that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| we've got people that are 80 years old that are African American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| We've got young Hispanic people coming to the shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| We've got people from absolutely all walks of life there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| The second aspect of it is to put out a positive energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| My personal mission, and it has nothing to do with this, is to forward an environmental cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| That's what this money is eventually going towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| Once a region has seen that someone is there manning the post, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6076)|
| 1:41:25| keeping the vibe up, making sure that the homeless people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| that they can't camp out in that little area anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| So to speak, the lights are on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| I've had a number of scrapes with MPC just because of the look of the way my decor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| I'm trying to simulate the kind of a bar that you'd see on the beach in the Caribbean, in Trinidad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| I travel the islands working down there transporting boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| It's a style that people don't get to see very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| People would appreciate the beach atmosphere in a place like Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| The other aspect of it was that it redevelops that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| It raises the property values of the area around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| I'm not saying that I've had that much impact, but I'm saying I've had some small impact in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| to bring that interest and that positive energy in some small way back to that little area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| The president of Ironwood Studios was one of the principal people to do that, to plant that flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| and say, we appreciate the history of this town and we appreciate that even though this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| or this region is run down, there's positive energy to be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| I realize that one of the tactics to purchase a property, because there's been some interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| KCDC and the city have expressed interest in maybe buying that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| I understand that one of the tactics is to move toward condemnation if a building looks the way it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| I'm just asking you to not do that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| The certificate of occupancy originally was done and all the inspections and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| to the last detail were looked at and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| It is functional and legitimate. It just kind of looks like a place from Trinidad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| It's too easy on me as far as whatever the redevelopment in that area is going to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| Last speaker is Zoe Risley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| Thank you for being here. Please state your name and address for the record and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| Hi, my name is Zoe Risley. I live at 5413 Yosemite Trail, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6218)|
| 1:43:45| Right now we're having a national conversation about gun violence in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| This conversation can seem so big and overwhelming at times, but think globally, act locally, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6229)|
| 1:43:56| I've lived, learned, and loved in this city since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| During these 12 plus years I've seen gun violence impact my city in many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| The Inskip Elementary School shooting, the murder of Central High School student Emma Walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| the killing of Fulton student Xavion Dobson, the senseless death of Bearden Middle School student Juwan Latham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| The shooting at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church. The shooting at my church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6257)|
| 1:44:23| I was seven years old in a performance of Annie Jr. when a man entered the sanctuary with so much hate in his heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| that he opened fire indiscriminately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| Two loved members of our community, Greg McKendry and Linda Lee Crager, were killed and many others were severely injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| The effects of gun violence like this are long lasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| I've been away for a summer since the attack on my place of worship and I still wake up with night terrors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| I'm still scared of strangers with big pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| Panic attacks, unwelcome memories, and constant paranoia have filled the pages of my life and it hurts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| I am constantly reminded of the physical, emotional, and spiritual damage that comes with gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| So why are these weapons that aid in such hurtful, senseless, and violent acts so easy to come by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| One key factor is the infamous gun show loophole, also known as the private sale loophole or the background check loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6310)|
| 1:45:17| This loophole allows unlicensed sellers to display and sell firearms alongside federal firearm licensees at gun shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6317)|
| 1:45:25| as well as from their homes or over the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| A supplier does not need a federal license if they are selling from a private collection and their primary goal is not to make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| Unlike licensed sellers, these unlicensed sellers are not required to conduct background checks on potential buyers and can even sell to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6335)|
| 1:45:42| This is incredibly irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| Closing this gun show loophole would be a major step in reducing the number of firearms in the hands of ill-equipped or dangerous citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| But now we're back to global, so let's think locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| One of these gun shows is the RK Gun Show held every few months at Tulhawi Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| It would be fantastic if this city facility was not used for gun shows at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| However, when a similar complex in Nashville attempted this regulation, they were sued by the Tennessee Firearms Association and Bill Goodman's Gun and Knife Shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6367)|
| 1:46:16| So if we can't ban gun shows from this venue altogether, maybe we can make them safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| We could close this loophole at a local level, create venue policies that require all sellers in these events to be licensed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| prohibit minors from attending, and check IDs at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| By taking these steps, we can not only push towards a safer Knoxville, but our city can be an example of how we can promote common sense gun policies at a local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6392)|
| 1:46:41| We can promote the responsible sale of firearms in our city and teach others how to follow suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| I'm not asking you to remove guns from every home in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| I'm not asking you to fix the nation's gun problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| I'm simply asking you to take reasonable steps to improve gun safety in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| I hope that someday every student, worshipper, child, parent, and friend can live in a world where they don't have to be scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6421)|
| 1:47:09| But until then, I hope the Council will consider these ideas and help make Knoxville a safer place for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6435)|
| 1:47:24| Several speakers on guns and gun legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6444)|
| 1:47:29| In terms of what we can do locally, I would encourage you to talk with our law department, the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| We are very limited in what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| We have a bill that was passed by the NRA and by the Tennessee Firearms Association for action that we have taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6459)|
| 1:47:48| Right now, state legislature is in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| There are several bills that are being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| I encourage you to contact your state legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| This bill would not allow us to stop gun shows here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6483)|
| 1:48:11| So there's a lot of preemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| The state legislature is doing a lot to take away our rights to control guns in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| We used to have laws that said you cannot have guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| They preempted us from saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| That's what we were sued about, but some legislation allows us if we have the metal detector and have security there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6512)|
| 1:48:45| So it's something that we're very concerned about and we've been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| So if you want more specific details on who's responsible for what and what can be done, I encourage you to contact the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| They can explain in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| You did not, other than the fact that municipalities are only allowed to legislate in areas where the state allows them to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6543)|
| 1:49:14| And guns is a particular area where the state legislature has taken away from municipalities the authority to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6554)|
| 1:49:20| They have preempted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| They have occupied the field with regard to the ability to legislate with regard to firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| And so we really do not have any control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| And that's a matter that's up to the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| And we would like control over it, but we don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| So there are several of the bills that are there right now that the legislature is considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| and we encourage you to contact our state legislators about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180227?start=6596)|
