| 0:03:36| Moving along to the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=216.02)|
| 0:03:38| Councilmembers, I want to begin by addressing the recent in-custody death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=218.02)|
| 0:03:43| of Ms. Lisa Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=223.02)|
| 0:03:45| First, I want to restate my sincere condolences to the family of Lisa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=225.02)|
| 0:03:50| Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=230.02)|
| 0:03:51| Watching the videos was incredibly upsetting for me, and I expect our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=231.02)|
| 0:03:59| officers to first and foremost be helpers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=239.02)|
| 0:04:03| Police officers are supposed to be helpers, and they're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=243.02)|
| 0:04:05| treat everyone with dignity and respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=245.02)|
| 0:04:08| And what I saw in those videos did not come close, not even close, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=248.02)|
| 0:04:12| meeting those expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=252.02)|
| 0:04:14| Second, as you all know, one of my first acts as mayor was to ask this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=254.02)|
| 0:04:20| body to approve funding for body-worn cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=260.02)|
| 0:04:23| Thank you for approving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=263.02)|
| 0:04:25| We have these videos, and we have released this footage voluntarily to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=265.02)|
| 0:04:29| the media and on our social media channels as soon as it was feasible and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=269.02)|
| 0:04:34| after the family had been given the opportunity to view it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=274.02)|
| 0:04:38| Third, accountability is critical, and as part of our commitment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=278.02)|
| 0:04:43| accountability, KPD is conducting an internal affairs investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=283.02)|
| 0:04:47| Once the investigation is complete, we will review the findings and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=287.02)|
| 0:04:51| determine disciplinary actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=291.02)|
| 0:04:54| To do this fairly and thoroughly takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=294.02)|
| 0:04:57| And I expect weeks, not months, is important to do this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=297.02)|
| 0:05:04| Now I want to move on to a different topic, Vision Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=304.02)|
| 0:05:09| Vision Zero is something that this council has supported, and I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=309.02)|

| 0:09:26| I want to talk more about Lisa Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=566.02)|
| 0:09:29| I want us to take this opportunity to look at the entire system that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=569.02)|
| 0:09:40| messed up, you know, right from the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=580.02)|
| 0:09:43| It makes me wonder if the state took Medicaid dollars, would the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=583.02)|
| 0:09:48| have been able to take care of her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=588.02)|

| 0:09:57| able to take care of her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=597.02)|
| 0:10:00| When the police came, was there any questioning of the hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=600.02)|
| 0:10:05| We defer to authority so often that we let things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=605.02)|
| 0:10:13| The officer behaved very unprofessionally, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=613.02)|
| 0:10:19| But I also have a very serious question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=619.02)|
| 0:10:22| Where do we take people that are in mental crisis, medical distress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=622.02)|
| 0:10:30| disabled, and perhaps indigent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=630.02)|
| 0:10:33| Where do we take these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=633.02)|
| 0:10:35| I think we need to take a broader look at this and use this terrible thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=635.02)|
| 0:10:43| that happened to maybe make some positive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=643.02)|

| 0:11:26| don't feel like we've done enough work to ensure that we're able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=686.02)|
| 0:11:31| provide the services that our residents deserve and that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=691.02)|
| 0:11:37| adequately addressing complaints that we receive from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=697.02)|
| 0:11:43| I've brought complaints of mistreatment before this body before by police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=703.02)|
| 0:11:51| and have not been believed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=711.02)|
| 0:11:54| And that has been a pattern in this city that we don't believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=714.02)|
| 0:11:59| particularly certain individuals when they bring complaints forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=719.02)|
| 0:12:05| And that does not keep our city safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=725.02)|
| 0:12:09| And quite honestly, it's an injustice to the police department itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=729.02)|
| 0:12:14| if we're not able to hold bad actors accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=734.02)|
| 0:12:18| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=738.02)|
| 0:12:20| I have questions about new programs police officers were supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=740.02)|
| 0:12:27| enrolled in, who would speak up when they saw bad actions by their fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=747.02)|
| 0:12:33| officers, and I've heard no accounts of any officers speaking out about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=753.02)|
| 0:12:38| what happened on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=758.02)|
| 0:12:40| None of the language used, none of the treatment was shocking or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=760.02)|
| 0:12:44| disturbing to other officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=764.02)|
| 0:12:47| That concerns me because we're supposed to be making a shift where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=767.02)|
| 0:12:52| conversations are taking place with KPD officers about holding each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=772.02)|
| 0:12:57| other accountable, and I have seen none of that in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=777.02)|
| 0:13:03| I continue to ask for the public to be brought into these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=783.02)|
| 0:13:09| We continue to have money invested in internal surveys, hiring new staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=789.02)|
| 0:13:17| members to develop these internal policies, but we're not listening to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=797.02)|
| 0:13:23| the public so that we can make changes that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=803.02)|
| 0:13:28| And changes that are needed may be removing police from certain situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=808.02)|
| 0:13:35| having alternative services in our city available with people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=815.02)|
| 0:13:41| properly trained to handle that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=821.02)|
| 0:13:45| And we have to be open to having those conversations and be willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=825.02)|
| 0:13:50| make those investments, as other cities have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=830.02)|
| 0:13:54| I continue to make the argument that I feel like that's best for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=834.02)|
| 0:13:57| residents as well as for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=837.02)|
| 0:14:03| Simply trying to protect our police officers at all costs is harming our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=843.02)|
| 0:14:12| We've got to be willing to make changes that we need in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=852.02)|
| 0:14:22| Just like what was brought up before, we need other services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=862.02)|
| 0:14:25| We have been aware of this. We know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=865.02)|
| 0:14:28| People have reported this to us. People have asked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=868.02)|
| 0:14:33| EMTs have asked for this. Hospital emergency rooms have asked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=873.02)|
| 0:14:38| There are other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=878.02)|
| 0:14:41| There are other services that can be sent in a situation like this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=881.02)|
| 0:14:46| we've got to make that commitment as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=886.02)|
| 0:14:50| Just hiding behind an internal affairs investigation is insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=890.02)|
| 0:14:59| It's not even enough of a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=899.02)|
| 0:15:03| But I see no commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=903.02)|
| 0:15:05| I see no commitment from this city to engage in any conversation any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=905.02)|
| 0:15:10| than waiting on an internal affairs report, and that's just not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=910.02)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=918.02)|

| 0:15:25| We'll move on with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=925.02)|

| 0:18:30| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1110.02)|
| 0:18:31| Tom Pelicano, 7601 Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1111.02)|
| 0:18:34| Our property borders on Vinonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1114.02)|
| 0:18:37| It's a corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1117.02)|
| 0:18:39| We replaced our fence with a solid fence to address some serious concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1119.02)|
| 0:18:45| We had vandalism, access to our utilities, access to our crawl space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1125.02)|
| 0:18:54| verbal abuse from foot traffic, extensive noise from traffic 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1134.02)|
| 0:19:02| cars drag racing up the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1142.02)|
| 0:19:06| That side of the house is the bedroom side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1146.02)|
| 0:19:10| It has no other protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1150.02)|
| 0:19:12| The ordinance asks us to open the fence above 42 inches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1152.02)|
| 0:19:15| which would impact both the sound reduction, the security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1155.02)|
| 0:19:20| and the privacy that it provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1160.02)|
| 0:19:23| We also are on the street with the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1163.02)|
| 0:19:27| The pick-up and drop-off traffic sits in idles for excess of an hour before pick-up and drop-off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1167.02)|
| 0:19:39| so we have additional noise from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1179.02)|
| 0:19:43| The street is mostly residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1183.02)|
| 0:19:50| It also has three churches, elementary school, and a single business up near Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1190.02)|
| 0:19:58| and also the fire station at the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1198.02)|
| 0:20:02| It provides access to Kingston Pike on one side and Middlebrook on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1202.02)|
| 0:20:10| That particular cut across is highly trafficked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1210.02)|
| 0:20:15| There is really almost no reason for it to allow that kind of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1215.02)|
| 0:20:21| and the noise that comes along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1221.02)|
| 0:20:23| We have Gallaher View to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1223.02)|
| 0:20:26| We have Wise Garber to the east, both four-lane, sometimes five-lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1226.02)|
| 0:20:35| with turn lanes and lights and almost zero residential on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1235.02)|
| 0:20:42| So really we are looking to have the fence that we put up left as it is to address all these concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1242.02)|
| 0:20:52| and anything the city could do to address the traffic on Venosdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1252.02)|
| 0:20:59| It's classified as a minor artery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1259.02)|
| 0:21:02| The other two streets I mentioned are major arteries that should carry most of that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1262.02)|
| 0:21:07| I would be willing to assume that the traffic on Venosdale probably exceeds, at any given time during the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1267.02)|
| 0:21:18| the traffic we see on those other two major arteries that are supposed to carry this traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1278.02)|
| 0:21:24| between Middlebrook and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1284.02)|
| 0:21:28| We had a meeting with West Hills Community Association last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1288.02)|
| 0:21:33| They had overwhelming support for leaving our fence the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1293.02)|
| 0:21:37| Those people know the hardships that we face because of the location of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1297.02)|
| 0:21:43| and the traffic on Venosdale and the foot traffic and the homelessness and all the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1303.02)|
| 0:21:49| We have printouts of all the feedback we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1309.02)|
| 0:21:53| We'd be happy to share it with the council members if they so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1313.02)|
| 0:22:01| Would the council members like to see the information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1321.02)|
| 0:22:04| You can give it to Mr. Johnson and he can share it with council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1324.02)|
| 0:22:15| We got the citation from the city and we appealed it to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1335.02)|
| 0:22:24| The hardships we mentioned in our application to them, they did not consider hardships at all that they could rule on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1344.02)|
| 0:22:32| They saw it as fair use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1352.02)|
| 0:22:37| Our hardships did not fall under those, so they denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1357.02)|
| 0:22:41| But there was feedback from that body that admitted to the fact that Venosdale is not being used in the fashion that it was intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1361.02)|
| 0:22:52| but they made no mention of making any changes, providing any relief from the traffic, such as speed humps or the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1372.02)|
| 0:23:04| I believe that's because they have classified it as minor artery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1384.02)|
| 0:23:12| I believe that's all I have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1392.02)|
| 0:23:15| Thank you, Mr. Pelicano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1395.02)|
| 0:23:18| Are you Renee Pelicano?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1398.02)|
| 0:23:20| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1400.02)|
| 0:23:22| You can also speak, if you would like, up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1402.02)|
| 0:23:26| You have up to three different people can speak in favor of this, if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1406.02)|
| 0:23:29| I would just, if any of the council members have any questions to the packets that we've handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1409.02)|
| 0:23:35| I would like to further elaborate on the correlation of Gallaher View, Wise Garbo, and Venosdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1415.02)|
| 0:23:42| According to the city road plan, they are all designated the same type of roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1422.02)|
| 0:23:48| Venosdale has 32 residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1428.02)|
| 0:23:52| Gallaher View has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1432.02)|
| 0:23:54| Wise Garbo has zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1434.02)|
| 0:23:56| Yet, Venosdale is getting the predominant amount of traffic from Middlebrook to Kingston Pike because of the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1436.02)|
| 0:24:06| It can very easily be satisfied by shutting the thruway down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1446.02)|
| 0:24:11| Shutting it down at the I-40-75 overpass still allows the fire department adequate access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1451.02)|
| 0:24:19| It still allows parents to route down Venosdale from Middlebrook for school pick-up and drop-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1459.02)|
| 0:24:26| because it is a one-way pick-up and drop-off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1466.02)|
| 0:24:29| and that would completely shut down that thruway, that drag strip, that cut-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1469.02)|
| 0:24:37| and that traffic should be redirected to Wise Garbo and Gallaher View| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1477.02)|
| 0:24:43| that are designed to carry the load of that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1483.02)|
| 0:24:53| Does that conclude your comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1493.02)|
| 0:24:55| That's all I have to say, and I'm available for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1495.02)|
| 0:24:59| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1499.02)|
| 0:25:00| Is there anyone else here to speak in favor of this appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1500.02)|
| 0:25:06| Is there anyone here to speak in opposition to this appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1506.02)|
| 0:25:12| Okay, Councilmember, I don't think we need a rebuttal then since you two are the only speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1512.02)|
| 0:25:19| So that concludes the timed portion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1519.02)|
| 0:25:23| We'll move to you, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1523.02)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1525.02)|
| 0:25:27| I want to thank the Pelinchanos for coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1527.02)|
| 0:25:31| and for telling us about what you're seeing on Venosdale and your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1531.02)|
| 0:25:40| Mr. Frost, let me turn to you just for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1540.02)|
| 0:25:46| In the role that Council has in this particular instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1546.02)|
| 0:25:51| are Councilmembers able to seek out additional information on these appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1551.02)|
| 0:25:59| outside of what's in the packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1559.02)|
| 0:26:02| You should look at the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1562.02)|
| 0:26:04| This is different from a rezoning application where you can get a general feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1564.02)|
| 0:26:10| but there are specific standards that are codified in the city zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1570.02)|
| 0:26:16| that relate to the granting of variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1576.02)|
| 0:26:20| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1580.02)|
| 0:26:21| And can you tell us about the rules for granting a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1581.02)|
| 0:26:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1587.02)|
| 0:26:28| Generally speaking, they're in Section 16.3 of Appendix B of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1588.02)|
| 0:26:33| The purpose of the variance process is to provide a narrowly circumscribed means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1593.02)|
| 0:26:39| by which relief may be granted from unforeseen applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1599.02)|
| 0:26:43| of the zoning regulations of this code that create practical difficulties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1603.02)|
| 0:26:48| or particular hardships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1608.02)|
| 0:26:51| Then it goes on to discuss the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1611.02)|
| 0:26:54| Variances will only be granted where special circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1614.02)|
| 0:26:58| or conditions such as exceptional narrowness, topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1618.02)|
| 0:27:02| or siding fully described in the findings of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1622.02)|
| 0:27:06| do not apply generally in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1626.02)|
| 0:27:08| Variances will not be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1628.02)|
| 0:27:12| from the particular district in which requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1632.02)|
| 0:27:18| Further goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1638.02)|
| 0:27:19| Variances granted must meet the minimum adjustment necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1639.02)|
| 0:27:23| for the reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1643.02)|
| 0:27:26| The granting of the variance is in harmony with the general purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1646.02)|
| 0:27:29| and intent of the code and will not be injurious to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1649.02)|
| 0:27:33| detrimental to the public welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1653.02)|
| 0:27:35| or in conflict with the general plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1655.02)|
| 0:27:42| No variance may allow a use that is prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1662.02)|
| 0:27:47| in the applicable base or overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1667.02)|
| 0:27:50| The variance granted is in the minimum adjustment necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1670.02)|
| 0:27:53| for the reasonable use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1673.02)|
| 0:27:55| and the requirements include that the granting of the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1675.02)|
| 0:28:01| will not be contrary to the public interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1681.02)|
| 0:28:03| that literal enforcement of the ordinance will result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1683.02)|
| 0:28:06| in unnecessary hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1686.02)|
| 0:28:09| and that by granting the permit, substantial justice will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1689.02)|
| 0:28:14| Part of the standards, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1694.02)|
| 0:28:18| that mere loss in value does not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1698.02)|
| 0:28:22| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1702.02)|
| 0:28:29| Those are standards, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1709.02)|
| 0:28:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1712.02)|
| 0:28:33| So we're looking for a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1713.02)|
| 0:28:37| We're looking for something that's not affecting the value of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1717.02)|
| 0:28:41| but something that is geographic in its nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1721.02)|
| 0:28:49| I didn't hear noise in that discussion, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1729.02)|
| 0:28:54| Is that one of our factors we can look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1734.02)|
| 0:28:58| I don't recall reading the word noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1738.02)|
| 0:29:02| Is there someone from the city who can maybe address what was going on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1742.02)|
| 0:29:10| Mr. Frost, may I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1750.02)|
| 0:29:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1752.02)|
| 0:29:14| In the ordinance for criminal trespassing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1754.02)|
| 0:29:18| it clearly states that it is a defense to prosecution under this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1758.02)|
| 0:29:24| that the property was open to the public when the person entered and remained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1764.02)|
| 0:29:29| We have already been the victims of vandalization to our property to the tune of $7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1769.02)|
| 0:29:35| Someone opened our crawlspace door, allowing a skunk infestation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1775.02)|
| 0:29:41| requiring us to replace our entire ductwork and vapor barrier under the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1781.02)|
| 0:29:46| But according to the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1786.02)|
| 0:29:48| we are not allowed to enclose that area of our property to deter criminal trespass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1788.02)|
| 0:29:57| but we can't prosecute if the property is open at the time of trespass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1797.02)|
| 0:30:03| So we're kind of between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1803.02)|
| 0:30:06| We can't close the property to protect ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1806.02)|
| 0:30:09| but we can't prosecute if it's open when somebody trespasses upon it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1809.02)|
| 0:30:14| Thank you for your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1814.02)|
| 0:30:15| I'm not familiar with the criminal code, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1815.02)|
| 0:30:19| I do understand your plight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1819.02)|
| 0:30:22| and it's very unfortunate that what has happened happened to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1822.02)|
| 0:30:26| I believe in review of the material, I think maybe some alternatives were proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1826.02)|
| 0:30:33| but that's not for me to advocate, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1833.02)|
| 0:30:39| Vice Mayor, Peter Ahrens is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1839.02)|
| 0:30:41| If you had a question for the city staff person who helps oversee these processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1841.02)|
| 0:30:47| Mr. and Ms. Pelicano, if you could let Mr. Ahrens speak at the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1847.02)|
| 0:30:58| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1858.02)|
| 0:30:59| Peter Ahrens, Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1859.02)|
| 0:31:01| Thank you, Director Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1861.02)|
| 0:31:03| Could you tell us a little bit about what is going on here with the citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1863.02)|
| 0:31:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1870.02)|
| 0:31:11| Privacy fences are limited to interior side yards or rear yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1871.02)|
| 0:31:17| They are prohibited anywhere from the five foot behind the front line of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1877.02)|
| 0:31:24| and in the entirety of the corner side yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1884.02)|
| 0:31:28| Noise is regulated out of Chapter 18 of the Code of Ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1888.02)|
| 0:31:33| which is outside of the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1893.02)|
| 0:31:36| and the zoning code does not prohibit security fences that are open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1896.02)|
| 0:31:42| but they do prohibit privacy fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1902.02)|
| 0:31:45| So anything over 42 inches, you know, simple situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1905.02)|
| 0:31:49| you can take out every other slat, you still provide that security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1909.02)|
| 0:31:52| but there's a level of visibility into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1912.02)|
| 0:31:58| And so in this particular instance, there was an issue with the height of the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1918.02)|
| 0:32:03| and the fact that it didn't have that transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1923.02)|
| 0:32:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1927.02)|
| 0:32:08| The height only becomes an issue when there's a lack of transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1928.02)|
| 0:32:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1932.02)|
| 0:32:14| And so if they could open up some do they have to open up an entire vertical slot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1934.02)|
| 0:32:19| or could they open some up at the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1939.02)|
| 0:32:22| From 42 inches up, if they removed every other slat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1942.02)|
| 0:32:28| I don't know how deep into the weeds you want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1948.02)|
| 0:32:30| but it seems like most fences have three horizontal slats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1950.02)|
| 0:32:35| that the verticals are attached to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1955.02)|
| 0:32:37| So essentially if you remove above the center horizontal up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1957.02)|
| 0:32:43| I would imagine that would make it compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1963.02)|
| 0:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1966.02)|
| 0:32:47| How tall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1967.02)|
| 0:32:48| Vice Mayor, your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1968.02)|
| 0:32:50| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1970.02)|
| 0:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1971.02)|
| 0:32:52| I think Ms. Ryder, were you next, Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1972.02)|
| 0:32:55| I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1975.02)|
| 0:32:56| Well, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1976.02)|
| 0:32:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1977.02)|
| 0:32:58| Just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1978.02)|
| 0:33:00| Mr. Ahrens, you can stick around, too, just in case one of them is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1980.02)|
| 0:33:03| Ms. Pelicano, do you know about what year your house was built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1983.02)|
| 0:33:07| 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1987.02)|
| 0:33:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1988.02)|
| 0:33:09| So 86, and this is the first fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1989.02)|
| 0:33:12| I saw there was a chain-link fence before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1992.02)|
| 0:33:14| Yes, we replaced the existing chain-link fence, which was at 42 inches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1994.02)|
| 0:33:19| and we actually pushed it back an additional three feet from the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1999.02)|
| 0:33:24| of where the chain-link fence was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2004.02)|
| 0:33:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2007.02)|
| 0:33:28| But that was a 42-inch open fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2008.02)|
| 0:33:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2010.02)|
| 0:33:31| And it provided us no security, no privacy, vandalism, verbal abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2011.02)|
| 0:33:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2018.02)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2019.02)|
| 0:33:40| Also, real quick, do you have a lock on your crawl space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2020.02)|
| 0:33:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2023.02)|
| 0:33:44| This crawl space was vandalized from the time we closed on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2024.02)|
| 0:33:48| to the time we moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2028.02)|
| 0:33:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2030.02)|
| 0:33:51| So no one was occupying the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2031.02)|
| 0:33:53| No, we were occupying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2033.02)|
| 0:33:55| But we were doing work on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2035.02)|
| 0:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2037.02)|
| 0:33:58| And, you know, we weren't familiar with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2038.02)|
| 0:34:00| and the workings of the house and everything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2040.02)|
| 0:34:03| We were familiarizing ourselves with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2043.02)|
| 0:34:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2045.02)|
| 0:34:06| So it wasn't secured and it was behind the chain-link fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2046.02)|
| 0:34:08| Well, it does have a door on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2048.02)|
| 0:34:10| It didn't have a lock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2050.02)|
| 0:34:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2051.02)|
| 0:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2052.02)|
| 0:34:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2053.02)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2054.02)|
| 0:34:15| I'm going to ask Mr. Ahrens a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2055.02)|
| 0:34:16| Sir, we have time limits, so I'm not trying to rush you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2056.02)|
| 0:34:19| I'm just trying to keep in my time limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2059.02)|
| 0:34:21| Mr. Ahrens, when I read the code about the open fences do not have a limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2061.02)|
| 0:34:28| so the fence could be any amount tall as long as 42 inches and above is not solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2068.02)|
| 0:34:34| It skips a slat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2074.02)|
| 0:34:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2075.02)|
| 0:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2076.02)|
| 0:34:37| So is there a measurement for how much the missing slats have to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2077.02)|
| 0:34:43| They don't have to be equal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2083.02)|
| 0:34:45| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2085.02)|
| 0:34:49| We're not going to get that detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2089.02)|
| 0:34:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2090.02)|
| 0:34:51| If they remove every other slat, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2091.02)|
| 0:34:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2093.02)|
| 0:34:54| But the Pelicanos could have a 72-inch tall fence or above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2094.02)|
| 0:34:59| It's just from 42 inches and above is where they need to saw off the slats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2099.02)|
| 0:35:04| so that the cars can see through at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2104.02)|
| 0:35:10| But our fence does not block the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2110.02)|
| 0:35:13| That's the reason for the code, and that's the code we have to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2113.02)|
| 0:35:18| So thank you for your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2118.02)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2121.02)|
| 0:35:22| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2122.02)|
| 0:35:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2126.02)|
| 0:35:29| To me, this is similar to an appeal that was brought before us in a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2129.02)|
| 0:35:40| neighborhood, and that resident was dealing with a ‑‑ I can't really think of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2140.02)|
| 0:35:51| to describe it, but essentially neighbors who had a lot of litter in their yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2151.02)|
| 0:35:59| And when we had discussed their options for relief, there weren't many options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2159.02)|
| 0:36:08| for relief because of the limitations on the city itself in enforcing and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2168.02)|
| 0:36:16| sure that folks maintain their yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2176.02)|
| 0:36:21| And so in that case, we found that there was a deprivation of beneficial use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2181.02)|
| 0:36:25| land and allowed the taller fence to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2185.02)|
| 0:36:30| I'm familiar with Von Asdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2190.02)|
| 0:36:32| I can imagine the amount of traffic that is brought by your house, which I agree is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2192.02)|
| 0:36:48| than would be anticipated for that type of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2208.02)|
| 0:36:53| And when I read through all the materials, I found the deprivation of beneficial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2213.02)|
| 0:36:58| of land and for this to be a ‑‑ in some ways a compromise to be able to recoup some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2218.02)|
| 0:37:10| of your, you know, some of your space that's being taken away, quite honestly, by all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2230.02)|
| 0:37:19| the traffic and motion and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2239.02)|
| 0:37:23| So I understand we have limitations in terms of how ‑‑ in terms of what can be granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2243.02)|
| 0:37:29| a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2249.02)|
| 0:37:32| But as I read through these details, I see a deprivation of beneficial use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2252.02)|
| 0:37:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2258.02)|
| 0:37:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2260.02)|
| 0:37:41| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2261.02)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2262.02)|
| 0:37:43| Mr. and Mrs. Pelicano, how long have you lived at this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2263.02)|
| 0:37:49| About a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2269.02)|
| 0:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2271.02)|
| 0:37:52| So I'm just curious, was there no, I guess, prior knowledge or time spent ahead of purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2272.02)|
| 0:38:00| this property in the vicinity to better understand the traffic and the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2280.02)|
| 0:38:08| I mean, the school's been there for 65 years, so I'm just ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2288.02)|
| 0:38:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2292.02)|
| 0:38:13| We hadn't lived in West Hills before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2293.02)|
| 0:38:15| Also, you're probably familiar with the housing market at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2295.02)|
| 0:38:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2299.02)|
| 0:38:20| About a year and a half, two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2300.02)|
| 0:38:22| Had to move very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2302.02)|
| 0:38:26| And the house, we purchased the house from an elderly gentleman who had not lived in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2306.02)|
| 0:38:32| it in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2312.02)|
| 0:38:33| He had moved into one of the retirement homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2313.02)|
| 0:38:37| So I guess my answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2317.02)|
| 0:38:40| We were not familiar with the level of traffic or any other situations that had to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2320.02)|
| 0:38:47| school at the time that we purchased the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2327.02)|
| 0:38:50| We certainly weren't aware of the encroachment of the drop‑off and pick‑up school traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2330.02)|
| 0:38:55| We are the only property in that corridor that is boxed in on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2335.02)|
| 0:39:01| They line up in front of our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2341.02)|
| 0:39:03| They line up on the side of our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2343.02)|
| 0:39:07| They sit there for over an hour idling, booming their radios, smoking their cigarettes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2347.02)|
| 0:39:14| And we get this an hour every morning and an hour every evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2354.02)|
| 0:39:17| And then shortly after that, it begins the rush‑hour traffic home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2357.02)|
| 0:39:22| So, no, we were not aware of the encroachment of the school pick‑up traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2362.02)|
| 0:39:27| And that is the biggest reason we put the solid fence up is because people are sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2367.02)|
| 0:39:34| for an hour plus on both sides of our property twice a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2374.02)|
| 0:39:40| And what are they going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2380.02)|
| 0:39:42| They're going to look through the slats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2382.02)|
| 0:39:44| They're going to see what's in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2384.02)|
| 0:39:46| What can I come back and get later after dark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2386.02)|
| 0:39:49| What can I ‑‑ we have school kids who throw their trash in our yard, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2389.02)|
| 0:39:55| half eaten apples, alcohol bottles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2395.02)|
| 0:39:58| One of the vandalisms we had was from the school kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2398.02)|
| 0:40:01| They turned on the water spigot on the side of our home and left it running because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2401.02)|
| 0:40:06| thought that was fun to do on their way home from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2406.02)|
| 0:40:09| So it's not just adults and passers‑throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2409.02)|
| 0:40:12| It's people who are in that neighborhood on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2412.02)|
| 0:40:16| Our other act of vandalism was a homeless gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2416.02)|
| 0:40:19| He was drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2419.02)|
| 0:40:20| He was asleep up against our fence on the side of our house using our water spigot as a shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2420.02)|
| 0:40:26| I came around the side of the house to, you know, come upon this man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2426.02)|
| 0:40:31| So like Ms. Parker said, you know, at what point do ‑‑ are we allowed some fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2431.02)|
| 0:40:41| use of our property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2441.02)|
| 0:40:43| We only sit 30 feet from Vannosdale to our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2443.02)|
| 0:40:48| Do any of the other neighbors have these issues in addition to you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2448.02)|
| 0:40:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2452.02)|
| 0:40:53| We are a unique property in that Vannosdale corridor because of how we are boxed in by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2453.02)|
| 0:41:00| school pickup traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2460.02)|
| 0:41:02| School pickup must be one way into the front of the school on Vannosdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2462.02)|
| 0:41:07| That means parents must either come down Vannosdale or come down Bennington and take a right on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2467.02)|
| 0:41:13| Vannosdale to pick up their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2473.02)|
| 0:41:15| They have no other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2475.02)|
| 0:41:17| I know there are sidewalks along Vannosdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2477.02)|
| 0:41:19| I know obviously there are other homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2479.02)|
| 0:41:21| We have the largest portion of sidewalk on Vannosdale and it runs the entire length of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2481.02)|
| 0:41:28| the side of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2488.02)|
| 0:41:29| From Bennington to the school, it's church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2489.02)|
| 0:41:34| So there are no other houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2494.02)|
| 0:41:36| I do sympathize with the corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2496.02)|
| 0:41:38| We have run into this a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2498.02)|
| 0:41:41| You essentially have two front yards as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2501.02)|
| 0:41:45| You know, I understand, I guess I'm a little perplexed just from prior to having purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2505.02)|
| 0:41:53| it, not really having an understanding of really the traffic and the other nuances that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2513.02)|
| 0:42:02| And we didn't put the fence up as soon as we moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2522.02)|
| 0:42:05| We lived there for nearly a year and it wasn't until we started incurring things like vandalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2525.02)|
| 0:42:12| and verbal abuse when we're out mowing the yard and having slurs and things yelled at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2532.02)|
| 0:42:18| us from passing motorists and the language from the school buses is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2538.02)|
| 0:42:23| You know, at some point you have to be realistic and say, what do I have to do to protect myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2543.02)|
| 0:42:30| my person, my property from this invasion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2550.02)|
| 0:42:34| Do you not think the every other slap removal would be somewhat helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2554.02)|
| 0:42:40| I do not because then that opens our property to prowling and visual access from the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2560.02)|
| 0:42:46| who are sitting there in their cars for hours at a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2566.02)|
| 0:42:50| It also allows somebody to get a hand and a foothold to scale the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2570.02)|
| 0:42:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2576.02)|
| 0:42:57| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2577.02)|
| 0:42:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2579.02)|
| 0:43:01| I drive by and walk by your property almost daily and you've done a beautiful job with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2581.02)|
| 0:43:08| the renovations and that fence is very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2588.02)|
| 0:43:11| It has not impeded my vision while driving by in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2591.02)|
| 0:43:17| In my opinion, it has helped you to be able to use your space and your home in a safe, sane manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2597.02)|
| 0:43:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2605.02)|
| 0:43:26| Just adding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2606.02)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2607.02)|
| 0:43:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2609.02)|
| 0:43:30| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2610.02)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2611.02)|
| 0:43:32| In looking through the record, I certainly think BZA had a very good discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2612.02)|
| 0:43:38| this particular matter and I think they did the best they could to interpret the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2618.02)|
| 0:43:44| which we just heard from Mr. Frost summarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2624.02)|
| 0:43:49| What I see here is that there is a unique geographic issue with this particular parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2629.02)|
| 0:43:57| and I understand why BZA made the decision they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2637.02)|
| 0:44:01| I also understand why Mr. Aarons made the decision he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2641.02)|
| 0:44:05| The uniqueness of the property allows for a hardship in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2645.02)|
| 0:44:09| So, I'm going to make a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2649.02)|
| 0:44:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2653.02)|
| 0:44:15| Okay, the motion has been made to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2655.02)|
| 0:44:17| It has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2657.02)|
| 0:44:19| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2659.02)|
| 0:44:23| Yeah, just one more question for the Pelicanos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2663.02)|
| 0:44:27| In the MLS listing from when the house was listed, when you purchased it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2667.02)|
| 0:44:31| there was a privacy barrier around your back patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2671.02)|
| 0:44:35| Was that there when you purchased the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2675.02)|
| 0:44:37| Yes, and it was very dilapidated and rotting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2677.02)|
| 0:44:41| And that was one of the first things we removed from the property because it was unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2681.02)|
| 0:44:47| Okay, so you didn't replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2687.02)|
| 0:44:49| You just removed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2689.02)|
| 0:44:51| But does it seem now that that's why it was there, to provide privacy from the concerns that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2691.02)|
| 0:44:58| We believe they had a hot tub in there at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2698.02)|
| 0:45:02| but we were never able to clarify why it was closed three sides to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2702.02)|
| 0:45:08| That structure was not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2708.02)|
| 0:45:10| Oh, it's in the packet that you gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2710.02)|
| 0:45:12| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2712.02)|
| 0:45:13| There's a picture of it and then how we just replaced the decking on the deck and made it an open deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2713.02)|
| 0:45:18| We also replaced the door that surrounded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2718.02)|
| 0:45:21| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2721.02)|
| 0:45:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2722.02)|
| 0:45:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2723.02)|
| 0:45:25| It was an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2725.02)|
| 0:45:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2726.02)|
| 0:45:27| Us trying to make the property more presentable for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2727.02)|
| 0:45:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2730.02)|
| 0:45:31| So the only thing I'll say is that is how the previous homeowners addressed the issues that you're concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2731.02)|
| 0:45:41| They fenced in their area with a privacy screen attached to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2741.02)|
| 0:45:46| No, that would have done nothing to abate the amount of noise that we get on the bedroom side of the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2746.02)|
| 0:45:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2752.02)|
| 0:45:53| All I'll say to my colleagues is what makes this distinctly different than the other fence that we had an appeal on is this is a corner lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2753.02)|
| 0:46:00| not an interior lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2760.02)|
| 0:46:02| And so I have concern about overriding the engineer's desire to not impede intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2762.02)|
| 0:46:09| And I hear everybody saying you can pull up to the stop bar and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2769.02)|
| 0:46:13| You can see the entire intersection from the very back corner of our fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2773.02)|
| 0:46:19| There is no impediment to the four-way stop intersection at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2779.02)|
| 0:46:24| There are pictures in that packet that will show me sitting in my car at the back section of the fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2784.02)|
| 0:46:30| and you can clearly see the entire visibility of the four-way stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2790.02)|
| 0:46:34| Ms. Ryder, did you have any other thing to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2794.02)|
| 0:46:37| No, I have my mic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2797.02)|
| 0:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2798.02)|
| 0:46:39| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2799.02)|
| 0:46:41| Yeah, I just want to comment that I appreciate the impact of the location where you live and the traffic associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2801.02)|
| 0:46:49| I don't think it's a small matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2809.02)|
| 0:46:51| I do think that this is the case for many corner lots across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2811.02)|
| 0:46:56| There are a lot of corner lots next to elementary schools and middle schools, and so I don't mean to minimize your burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2816.02)|
| 0:47:03| I think it's shared by others, and so I just don't think it meets the letter of what we're supposed to vote on for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2823.02)|
| 0:47:09| I can appreciate the hardship emotionally and tangibly for your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2829.02)|
| 0:47:15| but as it relates to the variance in our code and to be equitable for other corner lots besides schools across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2835.02)|
| 0:47:23| this would be setting a precedent for those folks as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2843.02)|
| 0:47:27| and I actually think that every other slat removal is a good solution that blocks most of the visibility into your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2847.02)|
| 0:47:35| and I think would do a lot of good and improve the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2855.02)|
| 0:47:39| I think that's a good solution, and I don't feel comfortable setting a precedent for every other corner lot next to an elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2859.02)|
| 0:47:44| or middle school or high school in the city, so I can't support this at the moment, but I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2864.02)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2870.02)|
| 0:47:51| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2871.02)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2872.02)|
| 0:47:53| The only thing I would say, I understand my colleague Mr. Smith's point about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2873.02)|
| 0:47:59| My question is, does, and this is just a hypothetical question, but does being on a minor artery next to a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2879.02)|
| 0:48:12| I do think that's different than being next to a corner lot in a school that is not a double yellow lined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2892.02)|
| 0:48:22| not a major, but a secondary artery through, from two big four lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2902.02)|
| 0:48:29| So I think that's how I could get comfortable with it being, what was the word you used Mr. Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2909.02)|
| 0:48:40| Something about a, she said something about a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2920.02)|
| 0:48:44| Uniqueness or hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2924.02)|
| 0:48:47| Well, because not all schools are on that minor artery with a corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2927.02)|
| 0:48:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2934.02)|
| 0:48:55| Okay, so the motion on the floor is to approve this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2935.02)|
| 0:48:59| Seeing no further lights, all those in favor please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2939.02)|

| 0:56:24| 22nd already has a lot of traffic because it has a light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3384.02)|
| 0:56:28| I'm just worried about the congestion that this is going to create without some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3388.02)|
| 0:56:33| of alternative added in to help the flow of traffic in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3393.02)|
| 0:56:41| I'll hold and let others speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3401.02)|
| 0:56:45| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3405.02)|
| 0:56:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3406.02)|
| 0:56:47| I was just going to ask if a member of the applicant, someone from the hospital, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3407.02)|
| 0:56:51| come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3411.02)|
| 0:56:52| Our packet includes an explanation for why this has been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3412.02)|
| 0:56:56| Maybe you could share why this is important to the hospital and, if possible, the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3416.02)|
| 0:57:03| of the traffic study that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3423.02)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3425.02)|
| 0:57:07| I'm Dennis Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3427.02)|
| 0:57:09| I'm an attorney here in town at 5504 Heathrow Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3429.02)|
| 0:57:13| I'm also a board chair emeritus of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3433.02)|
| 0:57:16| We've been looking at this traffic situation for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3436.02)|
| 0:57:20| That area of 21st is a one-way traffic currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3440.02)|
| 0:57:25| This is mainly a safety item because we have traffic coming the wrong way, sometimes at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3445.02)|
| 0:57:30| high speed on 21st, sometimes endangering our patients and their families for drop-offs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3450.02)|
| 0:57:36| Also, there have been at least two or three occasions on which trucks have struck the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3456.02)|
| 0:57:42| overhead walkway above 21st that connects the hospital and the medical office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3462.02)|
| 0:57:47| So, we think it's really more of a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3467.02)|
| 0:57:50| I understand the concerns about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3470.02)|
| 0:57:52| I also have with me Matt Schaefer, who's the president and CEO of Children's Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3472.02)|
| 0:57:57| who can provide some more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3477.02)|
| 0:58:00| Yeah, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3480.02)|
| 0:58:02| Matt Schaefer, 10031 Fox Grove Road, president and CEO of East Tennessee Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3482.02)|
| 0:58:09| As Mr. Ragsdale points out, this is a concern about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3489.02)|
| 0:58:13| It is a one-way avenue where East Tennessee Children's is the full occupant of both sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3493.02)|
| 0:58:19| It is the primary artery that connects our inpatient side of the mission to our outpatient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3499.02)|
| 0:58:25| side of the mission, which means we often have staff, families who are traversing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3505.02)|
| 0:58:31| with strollers and wheelchairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3511.02)|
| 0:58:36| And as Dennis points out, we've had issues with the skybridge that connects those buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3516.02)|
| 0:58:42| being hit in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3522.02)|
| 0:58:44| So, the request is around those safety items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3524.02)|
| 0:58:48| And as I think Mr. Clabo pointed out, the traffic study that was asked for by the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3528.02)|
| 0:58:53| of Engineering was studied, and there was minimal impact from this closure, primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3533.02)|
| 0:58:58| because you cannot come up from Cumberland through 21st Street at the stretch and block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3538.02)|
| 0:59:04| that we are referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3544.02)|
| 0:59:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3547.02)|
| 0:59:08| I really thought it was mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3548.02)|
| 0:59:11| It's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3551.02)|
| 0:59:12| Eye contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3552.02)|
| 0:59:13| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3553.02)|
| 0:59:14| So, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3554.02)|
| 0:59:16| I do think I reached out to long-term residents of the neighborhood, and they had two primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3556.02)|
| 0:59:20| concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3560.02)|
| 0:59:21| One was that pedestrian and bicycle pass-through not be impeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3561.02)|
| 0:59:27| And so, I think there were multiple renderings that have been done to achieve that based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3567.02)|
| 0:59:32| on the neighborhood input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3572.02)|
| 0:59:34| And the second was that, generally speaking, the city should retain long-term rights to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3574.02)|
| 0:59:40| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3580.02)|
| 0:59:42| And so, that's in this agreement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3582.02)|
| 0:59:44| So, those are the two concerns I heard from the neighborhood that the applicant was willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3584.02)|
| 0:59:49| to change their plan based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3589.02)|
| 0:59:52| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3592.02)|
| 0:59:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3593.02)|
| 0:59:54| I just want to thank East Tennessee Children's Hospital for, first, all you do for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3594.02)|
| 0:59:59| and region, and also for your flexibility when we brought these concerns to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3599.02)|
| 1:00:04| You guys were very open to accommodating the needs of the city and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3604.02)|
| 1:00:10| So, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3610.02)|
| 1:00:13| Any other questions or concerns or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3613.02)|
| 1:00:16| Seeing none, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3616.02)|
| 1:00:20| I appreciate the explanation from Children's Hospital and understand the constraints and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3620.02)|
| 1:00:31| concerns that you're working to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3631.02)|
| 1:00:38| From the city side of it, I still have concerns about our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3638.02)|
| 1:00:41| And I'd like to know more about what you, Mr. Clabo, briefly mentioned about another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3641.02)|
| 1:00:49| Actually, could you repeat what you said, which street you're looking at making a two-lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3649.02)|
| 1:00:53| two-direction street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3653.02)|
| 1:00:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3655.02)|
| 1:00:56| And it's currently two directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3656.02)|
| 1:00:58| But the overall plan is on 20th Street, there's now three commercial loading spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3658.02)|
| 1:01:06| Those will be removed as part of the hub, the residential development that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3666.02)|
| 1:01:11| down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3671.02)|
| 1:01:13| And that 20th Street will be converted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3673.02)|
| 1:01:16| And it will have a right turn and a left turn going southbound to Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3676.02)|
| 1:01:24| Currently, right now, there's only one lane each direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3684.02)|
| 1:01:27| So, we'll be essentially reallocating parking space to a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3687.02)|
| 1:01:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3693.02)|
| 1:01:35| I have reservations, but I will hold off on that and wait and see how the project moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3695.02)|
| 1:01:44| I think I'll abstain because I don't have enough information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3704.02)|
| 1:01:47| And I'm obviously not opposed to the entrance to Children's Hospital being safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3707.02)|
| 1:01:54| But I'm worried about the overall plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3714.02)|
| 1:01:56| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3716.02)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3718.02)|
| 1:01:59| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3719.02)|
| 1:02:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3720.02)|
| 1:02:01| Mr. Clabo, could I just ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3721.02)|
| 1:02:02| I'm looking at the map for, you're talking about those parking spaces, 20th at Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3722.02)|
| 1:02:07| Is there going to end up being a red light there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3727.02)|
| 1:02:09| You're talking about a left and a right turn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3729.02)|
| 1:02:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3731.02)|
| 1:02:12| So, that left-hand turn will just be at the mercy of you timing it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3732.02)|
| 1:02:15| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3735.02)|
| 1:02:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3736.02)|
| 1:02:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3737.02)|
| 1:02:18| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3738.02)|
| 1:02:19| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3739.02)|
| 1:02:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3740.02)|
| 1:02:21| I don't advise that for anyone, but whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3741.02)|
| 1:02:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3744.02)|
| 1:02:25| Seeing no further discussion, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3745.02)|
| 1:02:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3748.02)|
| 1:02:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3749.02)|
| 1:02:30| Motion carries eight with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3750.02)|
| 1:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3757.02)|
| 1:03:01| Council Members, a few people have signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3781.02)|
| 1:03:05| First, Logan Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3785.02)|
| 1:03:07| Mr. Higgins, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3787.02)|
| 1:03:10| State your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3790.02)|
| 1:03:13| Logan Higgins, 133 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3793.02)|
| 1:03:16| If it's all right, I would like to allow anyone here with opposition to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3796.02)|
| 1:03:22| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3802.02)|
| 1:03:23| Well, the practice is we have two people in favor speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3803.02)|
| 1:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3808.02)|
| 1:03:29| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3809.02)|
| 1:03:30| If Council Members have questions for you afterwards, follow-up questions, they can ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3810.02)|
| 1:03:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3814.02)|
| 1:03:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3815.02)|
| 1:03:36| Well, I think that, for the most part, this is relatively straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3816.02)|
| 1:03:41| If you all have had the opportunity to read through the packet that we put together, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3821.02)|
| 1:03:47| it's a very robust project and planned development being a new zoning overlay that's allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3827.02)|
| 1:03:54| after recode in the city is, of course, a very robust process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3834.02)|
| 1:04:01| And so this is our first hurdle in the process and our first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3841.02)|
| 1:04:07| And so from here, once this is approved, we will continue to hash out the details of this design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3847.02)|
| 1:04:14| and this plan and come back with the final plan to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3854.02)|
| 1:04:19| I also want to point out and just make note that we have put in a lot of work to meet with neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3859.02)|
| 1:04:28| and meet with the neighborhood and listen to concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3868.02)|
| 1:04:30| And so we've tried our best to include any potential things that we can do in the development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3870.02)|
| 1:04:37| to contribute to the neighborhood and help alleviate any concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3877.02)|
| 1:04:42| So, of course, happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3882.02)|
| 1:04:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3885.02)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3886.02)|
| 1:04:48| Next person to sign up to speak on this is Janice Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3888.02)|
| 1:04:53| Neutral is what you've described it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3893.02)|
| 1:04:56| But there's only three people total signed up, and you're the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3896.02)|
| 1:04:58| So come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3898.02)|
| 1:05:00| You're going to not speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3900.02)|
| 1:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3902.02)|
| 1:05:03| Next person signed up to speak is Sean Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3903.02)|
| 1:05:08| Also, Mr. Phillips, if you could state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3908.02)|
| 1:05:12| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3912.02)|
| 1:05:14| Sean Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3914.02)|
| 1:05:15| I live at 4312 Scarlet Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3915.02)|
| 1:05:19| My wife, daughter, and I live off Scarlet Lane in the South Woodlawn neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3919.02)|
| 1:05:22| adjacent to the planned development at Gilbert School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3922.02)|
| 1:05:25| I wanted to express some concern that myself and others in our neighborhood have regarding this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3925.02)|
| 1:05:29| and the impact that it will have on current residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3929.02)|
| 1:05:32| I do not see this ‑‑ I don't want this to come off as me not welcoming our new neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3932.02)|
| 1:05:37| I'm personally excited to see this neighborhood develop and grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3937.02)|
| 1:05:40| and I think it will be a positive thing for all involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3940.02)|
| 1:05:43| The concerns I have are related to the impact on traffic in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3943.02)|
| 1:05:47| as well as it appears there will be inadequate parking for the residents of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3947.02)|
| 1:05:51| My hope is that City Council and developers of this project will do everything within their powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3951.02)|
| 1:05:54| to mitigate the impact that this will have on the current residents in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3954.02)|
| 1:05:58| My first concern is regarding the impact that this will have on traffic in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3958.02)|
| 1:06:01| mainly in the mornings and evenings when school lets in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3961.02)|
| 1:06:04| All of the school buses enter and exit through Decatur Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3964.02)|
| 1:06:07| that's located next to Gilbert School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3967.02)|
| 1:06:09| Currently, in the morning and evenings, traffic on Gilbert School can get backed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3969.02)|
| 1:06:12| all the way to Decatur from the intersection of Woodlawn and Galbraith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3972.02)|
| 1:06:15| There's a bottleneck that is created at that intersection during these times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3975.02)|
| 1:06:17| that already causes a great deal of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3977.02)|
| 1:06:19| My concern is what the impact of the additional 75 units will do to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3979.02)|
| 1:06:23| It's my understanding that a new development of 75 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3983.02)|
| 1:06:26| is not required to hold a traffic study of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3986.02)|
| 1:06:28| but is there something similar that we can look at as to any impact that it may have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3988.02)|
| 1:06:33| There may not be any issues that come from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3993.02)|
| 1:06:35| and the current traffic we do have may not be exacerbated by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3995.02)|
| 1:06:37| but my concern is asking the question now rather than after the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3997.02)|
| 1:06:40| in the case that it causes some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4000.02)|
| 1:06:44| My second concern is the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4004.02)|
| 1:06:47| There's currently 83 spaces proposed for 75 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4007.02)|
| 1:06:51| To be honest, I didn't even consider this an issue at the first hearing about the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4011.02)|
| 1:06:55| but the more I thought about it, those numbers really don't seem to add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4015.02)|
| 1:06:58| If the parking lot is full, residents and guests will have to find parking elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4018.02)|
| 1:07:01| and I'm afraid this may lead to people parking directly on Galbraith Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4021.02)|
| 1:07:03| which would be extremely unsafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4023.02)|
| 1:07:05| or the possibility of residents parking on nearby side streets like the one that I live on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4025.02)|
| 1:07:09| We already have many residents on my street that utilize street parking outside of their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4029.02)|
| 1:07:13| I would hate for them to have to compete for parking with residents of this new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4033.02)|
| 1:07:16| Again, I'm in no way against this development and welcome our new neighbors with open arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4036.02)|
| 1:07:19| My hope is that anything that can be done to lessen the impact on current residents is taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4039.02)|
| 1:07:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4043.02)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4045.02)|
| 1:07:27| Councilmembers, that concludes people signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4047.02)|
| 1:07:30| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4050.02)|
| 1:07:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4051.02)|
| 1:07:32| I want to applaud the South Woodlawn neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4052.02)|
| 1:07:35| They've been welcoming to many new neighbors over the past decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4055.02)|
| 1:07:38| and their hospitality is very generous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4058.02)|
| 1:07:43| and I welcome every neighborhood to follow suit in finding a way to welcome new neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4063.02)|
| 1:07:48| Just for my colleagues as a refresher, if you'll remember, this body has already heard this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4068.02)|
| 1:07:53| voted on a planned development for this property before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4073.02)|
| 1:07:57| so this is a new run at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4077.02)|
| 1:07:59| and planned development also includes a public benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4079.02)|
| 1:08:03| so that's a rare element of this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4083.02)|
| 1:08:05| and I think the best public benefit for this is traffic safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4085.02)|
| 1:08:09| So I think there are three concerns that I've heard from South Woodlawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4089.02)|
| 1:08:13| not to repeat all of Mr. Phillips' comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4093.02)|
| 1:08:15| but the first is a macro level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4095.02)|
| 1:08:18| Because of your hospitality, there's a lot more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4098.02)|
| 1:08:20| Because of the investment in Baker Creek and other amenities, a lot more people want to visit and live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4100.02)|
| 1:08:25| So I think there's been significant traffic added to this area over the past five to seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4105.02)|
| 1:08:33| Mr. Brace, we spoke last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4113.02)|
| 1:08:35| I think it would do well to have the administration over the next year look at this corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4115.02)|
| 1:08:42| for lack of a better phrase, but this close nearby area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4122.02)|
| 1:08:45| and see what traffic safety concerns have emerged in the overall corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4125.02)|
| 1:08:52| Is that something the administration can look at over the next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4132.02)|
| 1:08:55| Yeah, I actually talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4135.02)|
| 1:08:56| Thank you very much for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4136.02)|
| 1:08:57| Yes, we did have a discussion, and I talked with Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4137.02)|
| 1:09:01| We had a brief conversation with Mr. Clabo about our transportation division doing some analysis of that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4141.02)|
| 1:09:08| Even though the thresholds weren't met for that, we believe that we should look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4148.02)|
| 1:09:12| So, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4152.02)|
| 1:09:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4153.02)|
| 1:09:14| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4154.02)|
| 1:09:15| The second concern is the specific point of entry and the kind of tricky sight lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4155.02)|
| 1:09:20| This is another corner lot beside a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4160.02)|
| 1:09:25| There's traffic entry and exit on Decatur right beside the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4165.02)|
| 1:09:31| Part of the conditions for this, number four and five, are confirming sight distance at the driveway access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4171.02)|
| 1:09:38| and number five is meeting all the requirements of city engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4178.02)|
| 1:09:42| Mr. Clabo, we also talked about this real specific point of entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4182.02)|
| 1:09:45| There's a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4185.02)|
| 1:09:46| There's a sight line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4186.02)|
| 1:09:47| There's a school entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4187.02)|
| 1:09:49| And so because of the number of units, the applicant doesn't have to do a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4189.02)|
| 1:09:54| But I do think an extra lens or an extra kind of review by somebody in traffic engineering is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4194.02)|
| 1:10:00| particularly for that point of entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4200.02)|
| 1:10:02| Is that something city engineering can do as part of this review of this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4202.02)|
| 1:10:07| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4207.02)|
| 1:10:08| And as we receive plans, that entry point will have to be certified by their design consultant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4208.02)|
| 1:10:15| So there will be a review of the sight distance there to make sure it meets all the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4215.02)|
| 1:10:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4222.02)|
| 1:10:23| So the improvement could be mild, but that review will be taken care of as part of these number four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4223.02)|
| 1:10:27| and number five conditions that I just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4227.02)|
| 1:10:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4229.02)|
| 1:10:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4230.02)|
| 1:10:31| And the third element is related to parking spillover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4231.02)|
| 1:10:34| I think Mr. Phillips mentioned this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4234.02)|
| 1:10:36| Mr. Higgins, if I could have you come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4236.02)|
| 1:10:38| We spoke earlier this week as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4238.02)|
| 1:10:42| We discussed incorporating a specific policy into the tenant operating agreement to prevent some type of spillover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4242.02)|
| 1:10:49| Apartment management is obviously responsible for making sure people park on their site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4249.02)|
| 1:10:53| but there wasn't a condition listed in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4253.02)|
| 1:10:55| So is that something the applicant would be willing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4255.02)|
| 1:10:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4258.02)|
| 1:10:59| We're completely fine with making sure that the tenants understand that they need to be parking on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4259.02)|
| 1:11:07| and not to park on other people's property for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4267.02)|
| 1:11:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4270.02)|
| 1:11:11| And what we discussed was a formal piece, some type of statement in the operating agreement with the tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4271.02)|
| 1:11:19| or the management procedures of the property to assure that, not just hope for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4279.02)|
| 1:11:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4284.02)|
| 1:11:25| So unless there's any questions from our colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4285.02)|
| 1:11:28| I would like to make a motion to add a seventh condition to this based on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4288.02)|
| 1:11:33| and I'll just read what I've written here for that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4293.02)|
| 1:11:37| Including an off-site parking prevention policy in the property operating agreement with tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4297.02)|
| 1:11:42| And I believe both the applicant, the neighborhood, and the city are all agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4302.02)|
| 1:11:47| So that's the formal motion I would make to add to this plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4307.02)|
| 1:11:52| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4312.02)|
| 1:11:53| So motion to amend by adding the language that Councilmember Smith just said, just recited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4313.02)|
| 1:12:00| it's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4320.02)|
| 1:12:02| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4322.02)|
| 1:12:03| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4323.02)|
| 1:12:04| Yeah, can you share a little bit more about how that would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4324.02)|
| 1:12:08| Well, I intentionally put the ownership on the applicant to address that in their operating procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4328.02)|
| 1:12:17| So I don't manage properties, so I didn't want to kind of put my lack of expertise onto them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4337.02)|
| 1:12:22| but they have agreed to dictate that in the operating agreement with the tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4342.02)|
| 1:12:28| And accordingly, if we make this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4348.02)|
| 1:12:31| planning will have to review that as well as one of the conditions in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4351.02)|
| 1:12:36| And if it's insufficient, the neighborhood can appeal to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4356.02)|
| 1:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4362.02)|
| 1:12:43| Does everyone understand the amendment that's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4363.02)|
| 1:12:47| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4367.02)|
| 1:12:48| Apparently we haven't made the first motion, so that hasn't been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4368.02)|
| 1:12:52| We went right to public, to speakers on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4372.02)|
| 1:12:55| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4375.02)|

| 1:12:59| And now we'll go back to the proposed amendment by Councilmember Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4379.02)|
| 1:13:03| which has also been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4383.02)|
| 1:13:05| Does everyone understand the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4385.02)|
| 1:13:07| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4387.02)|

| 1:15:12| There's one person signed up to speak on this item, Mr. Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4512.02)|
| 1:15:17| If you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4517.02)|
| 1:15:19| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4519.02)|
| 1:15:21| Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4521.02)|
| 1:15:25| So I'm not exactly opposed to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4525.02)|
| 1:15:27| but I'm curious why we're not addressing this a little bit broader with broader paint strokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4527.02)|
| 1:15:33| It looks like this was very surgical to hit one point that came out in the matrix recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4533.02)|
| 1:15:39| but I think that Paragraph A deals with the ward map issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4539.02)|
| 1:15:42| which is plugging affordable housing and building on infill lots in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4542.02)|
| 1:15:48| So I'm just wondering why did we not address Paragraph A at the same time we were addressing Paragraph B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4548.02)|
| 1:15:56| We'll have the discussion after your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4556.02)|
| 1:15:59| Do you have anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4559.02)|
| 1:16:00| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4560.02)|
| 1:16:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4561.02)|
| 1:16:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4562.02)|
| 1:16:04| Council members, that concludes people who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4564.02)|
| 1:16:07| Council member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4567.02)|
| 1:16:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4569.02)|
| 1:16:10| Mr. Clabo, so you and I discussed earlier today, I have no issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4570.02)|
| 1:16:15| and I let Mr. Cannon know that earlier with the edits that are proposed and changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4575.02)|
| 1:16:21| the red line in Part B of 22.5 that we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4581.02)|
| 1:16:28| I just want for the public record, I appreciate what Mr. Marlow brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4588.02)|
| 1:16:35| The issue that we've had that is keeping 60 to 80 percent of our existing old ward map neighborhoods from putting sheds up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4595.02)|
| 1:16:47| building accessory dwelling units, and lots of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4607.02)|
| 1:16:50| It's impeding people getting permits, and sometimes it's taken them up to six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4610.02)|
| 1:16:55| and thousands of dollars to be able to just get simple permits for simple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4615.02)|
| 1:17:00| I know you guys are working on that, and that is the ward map issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4620.02)|
| 1:17:04| So you guys have said you're continuing to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4624.02)|
| 1:17:07| I just want to, for the record, this entire section, 22.5-20, was passed and discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4627.02)|
| 1:17:16| this is important for my colleagues, on December 5th, 2017, by a previous council, two previous councils back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4636.02)|
| 1:17:26| And at that time in the discussion amongst former staff and former council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4646.02)|
| 1:17:32| the discussion all revolved around stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4652.02)|
| 1:17:36| And there was discussion about how this would have little to no impact on anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4656.02)|
| 1:17:41| to pass it as it was passed December 5th, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4661.02)|
| 1:17:46| But what it did, the letter A there, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4666.02)|
| 1:17:50| no building permit shall be issued unless the property shown on the approved site development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4670.02)|
| 1:17:55| is a single lot of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4675.02)|
| 1:17:58| That was the moment that that unsuspecting council, and I want to say engineering staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4678.02)|
| 1:18:06| inadvertently had the unintended consequences of triggering all these homes that were built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4686.02)|
| 1:18:13| in the late 1800s, 1900s, and sometimes afterwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4693.02)|
| 1:18:17| that often have one or two word map lines going through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4697.02)|
| 1:18:23| And then all of a sudden, all of us can't do even a shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4703.02)|
| 1:18:26| We can't get a permit for a shed. We can't get a permit for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4706.02)|
| 1:18:29| So that's all I'm asking is relief for my constituents who keep asking me when it's going to get fixed for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4709.02)|
| 1:18:36| So, because I don't believe in abstaining, I'm going to go ahead and vote yes on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4716.02)|
| 1:18:42| Okay? But I wholeheartedly am opposed to Part A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4722.02)|
| 1:18:45| and I would love nothing more than to strike that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4725.02)|
| 1:18:47| But unfortunately, if we struck that, we wouldn't be fixing the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4727.02)|
| 1:18:52| because we have to fix the definition of lot of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4732.02)|
| 1:18:55| and we can't keep punishing everybody for not asking for the word maps to be fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4735.02)|
| 1:19:00| from the moment things were built in the 1800s, 1900s, and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4740.02)|
| 1:19:05| So, Mr. Clabo, on the record, would you like to one more time tell me you guys are definitely working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4745.02)|
| 1:19:10| and the law department is going to find some relief for our constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4750.02)|
| 1:19:14| Yes. We are definitely working on that, and that will be something we'll be bringing back to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4754.02)|
| 1:19:19| Okay. And I look forward to having that discussion prior to it hitting an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4759.02)|
| 1:19:25| Thank you. Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4765.02)|
| 1:19:28| I echo what my colleague, Councilwoman Ryder, said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4768.02)|
| 1:19:32| I'm more to the point about when do we think we can expect something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4772.02)|
| 1:19:38| because we've been talking about this for at least a year or more that we're working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4778.02)|
| 1:19:45| and I understand it's hard, but in the meantime, we have people who are stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4785.02)|
| 1:19:50| Any idea, Mr. Clabo, what's the target? I mean, is it two more months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4790.02)|
| 1:19:58| Ms. Fugate, thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4798.02)|
| 1:20:00| I just want to say that it's very important to me, both as mayor and as owner of a 1905 home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4800.02)|
| 1:20:08| and your constituents and my constituents are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4808.02)|
| 1:20:12| So this is an important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4812.02)|
| 1:20:14| Both this agenda item and 12A are directly in response to concerns from whether single individual property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4814.02)|
| 1:20:23| or developers, the feedback we got from the developers roundtable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4823.02)|
| 1:20:28| and then this council supported our hiring of the outside consultant to help us examine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4828.02)|
| 1:20:35| and come up with recommendations to overhaul, streamline, update, and improve our development services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4835.02)|
| 1:20:43| And again, that's for a huge commercial development or someone trying to do a shed in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4843.02)|
| 1:20:50| We are taking those on, and Mr. Cannon, as our chief of economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4850.02)|
| 1:20:55| because this is an economic development issue, as well as engineering and technical one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4855.02)|
| 1:21:00| is charged with continuing to bring these solutions to council and to the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4860.02)|
| 1:21:07| and to the public for the fixes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4867.02)|
| 1:21:09| Mr. Cannon, do you have anything you can add and share as far as expected time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4869.02)|
| 1:21:14| to bring more of these solutions to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4874.02)|
| 1:21:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4878.02)|
| 1:21:19| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4879.02)|
| 1:21:21| First, let me say that Mr. Merlo's comments are spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4881.02)|
| 1:21:23| That's a concern of ours, too, as is Councilwoman Ryder's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4883.02)|
| 1:21:28| Our intent had been to come this month with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4888.02)|
| 1:21:32| We need to do a little more work to get this as simple as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4892.02)|
| 1:21:37| Our intent is to bring it to you in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4897.02)|
| 1:21:40| I will tell you that it's subject to, and this is still up for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4900.02)|
| 1:21:44| whether we need to go to the Planning Commission or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4904.02)|
| 1:21:47| If we have to go to the Planning Commission first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4907.02)|
| 1:21:49| then it may be the June meetings before you see this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4909.02)|
| 1:21:52| You have my word that whatever goes to planning, you will see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4912.02)|
| 1:21:55| and you will see that we are actively working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4915.02)|
| 1:22:00| What we have proposed tonight, I wish we could have fixed it in one shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4920.02)|
| 1:22:05| I truly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4925.02)|
| 1:22:06| But this is a very heavy burden on the development community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4926.02)|
| 1:22:12| regardless of the size of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4932.02)|
| 1:22:15| to have them going through a two-plat process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4935.02)|
| 1:22:19| Surveyors are tough to come by right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4939.02)|
| 1:22:22| So you're right, Mr. Merlo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4942.02)|
| 1:22:23| It's surgical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4943.02)|
| 1:22:24| It's intentionally surgical because it just didn't seem right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4944.02)|
| 1:22:27| if we could fix it this quick, to have put this off until May or June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4947.02)|
| 1:22:32| But it is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4952.02)|
| 1:22:33| You have our word on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4953.02)|
| 1:22:35| Councilmember Fugate, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4955.02)|
| 1:22:37| Thank you, Director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4957.02)|
| 1:22:39| That answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4959.02)|
| 1:22:42| I do believe better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4962.02)|
| 1:22:44| I don't want to wait for perfect and not make things better now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4964.02)|
| 1:22:48| but I look forward to it in no more than two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4968.02)|
| 1:22:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4972.02)|

| 1:22:54| That's more than two months, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4974.02)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4976.02)|

| 1:24:52| But we're well aware that the city's been burning businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5092.02)|
| 1:24:58| We've got bylaw incident number 12D048777, three sevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5098.02)|

| 1:25:23| to the same conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5123.02)|
| 1:25:25| So, bylaw, the city's burning it, or already burned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5125.02)|

| 1:25:51| At any rate, now we have a new story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5151.02)|
| 1:25:54| This is a big story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5154.02)|

| 1:34:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5689.02)|
| 1:34:50| Will Bowen, 5669 Eagle Crest Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5690.02)|
| 1:34:54| So I wanted to come up and speak about Lisa Edwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5694.02)|
| 1:34:58| who had her life wrongfully taken from her a couple weeks ago in KPD custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5698.02)|
| 1:35:06| And this is really the fault of the hospital and KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5706.02)|
| 1:35:12| I don't want to put the blame on one specific organization because they both failed her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5712.02)|
| 1:35:17| So we'll just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5717.02)|
| 1:35:20| But you all don't exactly have jurisdiction over Fort Sanders since it's a private hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5720.02)|
| 1:35:25| Anyway, so the four officers that took care of, that were present at this incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5725.02)|
| 1:35:35| Adam Barnett, Timothy D'Eustachio, Sergeant Brandon Wardlaw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5735.02)|
| 1:35:41| and Transportation Officer Danny Dugan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5741.02)|
| 1:35:44| They're all on administrative leave right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5744.02)|
| 1:35:47| So, you know, the thing about internal affairs investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5747.02)|
| 1:35:51| which I understand that we have to give people, you know, not benefit of the doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5751.02)|
| 1:35:57| but innocent until proven guilty, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5757.02)|
| 1:36:00| But internal affairs, when you're investigating yourself naturally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5760.02)|
| 1:36:06| there's not going to be justice the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5766.02)|
| 1:36:13| I feel like we've seen that a lot in the last couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5773.02)|
| 1:36:16| especially with the, we've gotten movements, you know, against police brutality the last couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5776.02)|
| 1:36:22| Of course, we're all familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5782.02)|
| 1:36:25| But, you know, no public statement being made other than like surface level stuff is not sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5785.02)|
| 1:36:36| because a family lost a family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5796.02)|
| 1:36:40| Like that's, I can't imagine the pain that they're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5800.02)|
| 1:36:47| And Lisa had just moved to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5807.02)|
| 1:36:50| She wanted to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5810.02)|
| 1:36:52| She wanted to, you know, be comfortable in Knoxville, and that was taken away from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5812.02)|
| 1:37:04| I think more, you all can do more to assure the public that you're going to hold the officers accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5824.02)|
| 1:37:15| that were present when Lisa passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5835.02)|
| 1:37:22| And, I mean, this all goes back to police training, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5842.02)|
| 1:37:26| You should be able to tell when somebody's in medical distress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5846.02)|
| 1:37:31| And when you've got somebody that's in your custody that is clearly in medical distress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5851.02)|
| 1:37:40| I mean, I don't know how to explain this in a way that's not complete common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5860.02)|
| 1:37:46| You know, you take care of people that need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5866.02)|
| 1:37:49| And I understand that the hospital discharged her, but that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5869.02)|
| 1:37:53| If you can see that there's something wrong, it doesn't matter what the hospital did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5873.02)|
| 1:37:58| You've got to find a way to take care of her and make sure that she doesn't, that nothing happens to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5878.02)|
| 1:38:05| And that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5885.02)|
| 1:38:07| And it's a disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5887.02)|
| 1:38:11| How can you take an oath to protect and serve and then allow a woman to die in your custody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5891.02)|
| 1:38:23| I don't, you know, this keeps happening, not just in Knoxville, but across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5903.02)|
| 1:38:30| And I don't understand why we can't do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5910.02)|
| 1:38:35| It's, I mean, I don't know what to say that you all haven't already heard on the news and everywhere 500 times in the last couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5915.02)|
| 1:38:46| I mean, you know, it's, I just, we just, I wish that we could be reassured that they're going to be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5926.02)|
| 1:39:03| And I understand that they're under investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5943.02)|
| 1:39:05| I just, I question whether or not this investigation is impartial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5945.02)|
| 1:39:13| Because as an internal affairs investigation, naturally they want to protect cops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5953.02)|
| 1:39:17| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5957.02)|
| 1:39:19| And we've seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5959.02)|
| 1:39:20| It's the good old boy culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5960.02)|
| 1:39:21| We're in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5961.02)|
| 1:39:22| I mean, it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5962.02)|
| 1:39:24| You know, it's, we, the last year or so in the city of Knoxville, we've talked about bringing change to our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5964.02)|
| 1:39:33| And, you know, I wanted to have confidence that we will see change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5973.02)|
| 1:39:39| But we haven't seen it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5979.02)|
| 1:39:42| So we're counting on you all to fix this and help us see change in our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5982.02)|
| 1:39:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5989.02)|
| 1:39:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5990.02)|
| 1:39:53| Next person signing up to speak is Walker Kinzler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5993.02)|
| 1:39:58| Mr. Kinzler, if you could state your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5998.02)|
| 1:40:02| My name is Walker Kinzler, 7008 Walkin Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6002.02)|
| 1:40:07| Thank you for allowing us to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6007.02)|
| 1:40:09| My name is Walker Kinzler and I'm a student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, part of the College Democrats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6009.02)|
| 1:40:14| and the statewide president of the Tennessee College Democrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6014.02)|
| 1:40:18| And the Knoxville Police Department's video of the death of Lisa Edwards was harrowing and disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6018.02)|
| 1:40:26| Before I begin, in earnest, I'd like to also hit on something that the council doesn't have as much influence over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6026.02)|
| 1:40:31| and that's Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6031.02)|
| 1:40:35| Hospitals should be scrutinized just as closely and just as equally for their involvement in Miss Edwards' death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6035.02)|
| 1:40:44| Fort Sanders discharged her and tossed her out over her distressed objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6044.02)|
| 1:40:50| and then called for the police to deal with the situation that did not require the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6050.02)|
| 1:40:55| Hospitals care for and listen to their patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6055.02)|
| 1:40:59| They don't treat them with contempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6059.02)|
| 1:41:02| So Fort Sanders must go through a drastic cultural and practical change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6062.02)|
| 1:41:06| and I hope that the city council uses all of its influence that it has to compel them to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6066.02)|
| 1:41:12| But when the Knoxville Police Department first confronted Lisa Edwards at Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6072.02)|
| 1:41:17| she told the officers she had a stroke and could not walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6077.02)|
| 1:41:21| The officers did not care and demanded she leave or be arrested and sent to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6081.02)|
| 1:41:28| Deciding to arrest this elderly woman who has immense trouble walking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6088.02)|
| 1:41:32| they called a jail transport van and attempted with the driver to place her up inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6092.02)|
| 1:41:39| And in the video, she's clearly in medical distress, wheezing terribly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6099.02)|
| 1:41:44| and pleading with the officers that she could not stand nor breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6104.02)|
| 1:41:50| The entire time, these officers, our officers, mock her or get frustrated with Miss Edwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6110.02)|
| 1:41:57| ridiculing her with words like dead weight and claiming that she's either playing games or just acting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6117.02)|
| 1:42:05| Later, after she became unconscious, an officer pulled her up by her hair to lift her head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6125.02)|
| 1:42:13| After struggling for about 30 minutes, they instead placed Miss Edwards in the back of a cramped squad car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6133.02)|
| 1:42:18| where she is never once able to sit upright, not once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6138.02)|
| 1:42:22| The officer drives away with her on her side, wheezing and sounding desperate for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6142.02)|
| 1:42:27| And you can see in the video, she's clearly fighting and struggling to just sit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6147.02)|
| 1:42:32| And she would end up losing consciousness in that car and dying a day later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6152.02)|
| 1:42:36| And I'm very disappointed with the Knoxville Attorney's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6156.02)|
| 1:42:40| who announced that none of the officers involved will face charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6160.02)|
| 1:42:43| They claim that, quote, at no time did law enforcement interaction cause or contribute to Miss Edwards' death, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6163.02)|
| 1:42:51| But let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6171.02)|
| 1:42:53| The officers and transport driver involved ignored Lisa Edwards' medical emergency and contributed to her death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6173.02)|
| 1:43:00| Their deliberate inaction contributed to her death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6180.02)|
| 1:43:03| There are no excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6183.02)|
| 1:43:05| Anyone, regardless of medical knowledge and training, can see and hear in that video that she is in medical distress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6185.02)|
| 1:43:12| The KPD personnel showed a constant lack of care and empathy in response to her pleas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6192.02)|
| 1:43:18| And her death is on their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6198.02)|
| 1:43:21| The officers in the video clearly treated Miss Edwards different because they perceived her as no better than some vagrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6201.02)|
| 1:43:28| Some police officers treat people as if we're part of two classes, those that seem more clean and respectful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6208.02)|
| 1:43:34| and those who they deem as dirty and poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6214.02)|
| 1:43:37| But let me tell you, that is not up for them or anyone to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6217.02)|
| 1:43:40| There should be no class structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6220.02)|
| 1:43:42| Every single person should be treated equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6222.02)|
| 1:43:45| Also, some people like Edwards at times in the video are not able to fully articulate their needs and conditions to authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6225.02)|
| 1:43:53| And this lack of articulation should not be regarded as someone being less of a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6233.02)|
| 1:43:58| The officer's president should have been her voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6238.02)|
| 1:44:02| They should have recognized her medical distress and got her help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6242.02)|
| 1:44:06| They should have served and protected her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6246.02)|
| 1:44:09| And instead, they failed her and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6249.02)|
| 1:44:14| I'm calling on the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6254.02)|
| 1:44:16| All of Knoxville is calling on the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6256.02)|
| 1:44:18| Every single person that has seen that video is calling on the city council to hold those KPD personnel involved accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6258.02)|
| 1:44:26| They should already be facing charges, but they are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6266.02)|
| 1:44:29| And I know there is a current internal affair investigation by KPD in the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6269.02)|
| 1:44:34| And I pray that they make the correct decisions and bring about the justice that is so desperately needed to Miss Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6274.02)|
| 1:44:42| And I can tell all of you that Knoxville is worried that there's not going to be much more than a slap on the wrist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6282.02)|
| 1:44:48| And the police chief has said for the past few months that he wants the department to be more equal and fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6288.02)|
| 1:44:55| and to treat everyone with respect, dignity, and basic decency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6295.02)|
| 1:44:59| That was in the statement related to Miss Edwards' death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6299.02)|
| 1:45:02| I'll just say—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6302.02)|
| 1:45:03| Mr. Kinsler, your five minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6303.02)|
| 1:45:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6305.02)|
| 1:45:10| The next person signed up to speak is Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6310.02)|
| 1:45:17| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6317.02)|
| 1:45:18| Hi, I'm Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6318.02)|
| 1:45:23| Harold, thank you for addressing and pledging to solve the issue with the Ward lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6323.02)|
| 1:45:28| in, I guess, something of a timely fashion for government movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6328.02)|
| 1:45:33| But I want to take a moment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6333.02)|
| 1:45:35| I think this is yet again a situation in which we can see and appreciate the value of the body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6335.02)|
| 1:45:44| And I'm glad that our city has them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6344.02)|
| 1:45:46| And I think they have been incredibly useful in this particular issue for showing us what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6346.02)|
| 1:45:55| and eliminating lots of speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6355.02)|
| 1:45:59| I believe that the DA's office got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6359.02)|
| 1:46:02| I do not see any crimes being committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6362.02)|
| 1:46:04| I do see—I hope it's policy violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6364.02)|
| 1:46:07| I hope there's some reprimands handed down, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6367.02)|
| 1:46:10| But I also see some things that are getting glossed over that I think need to be highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6370.02)|
| 1:46:17| I think the transport officer should be highlighted for standing up to his fellow officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6377.02)|
| 1:46:21| and refusing to load her in the back of the van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6381.02)|
| 1:46:24| If we had more officers that would stand up to other officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6384.02)|
| 1:46:27| perhaps Memphis wouldn't have happened earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6387.02)|
| 1:46:30| Perhaps George Floyd wouldn't have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6390.02)|
| 1:46:33| I think the fact that one officer stood up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6393.02)|
| 1:46:36| no, I'm not going to do this to his other officers, including one who has stripes on his uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6396.02)|
| 1:46:41| should be celebrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6401.02)|
| 1:46:43| That our police department has a culture that allows and respects an individual officer to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6403.02)|
| 1:46:49| and say his piece and not be bullied into going along with the flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6409.02)|
| 1:46:54| I also think it's worth pointing out that the initial interaction with Ms. Edwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6414.02)|
| 1:46:59| the officer basically said he didn't want to arrest her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6419.02)|
| 1:47:03| He at one point said it would be silly if he had to arrest her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6423.02)|
| 1:47:07| He went and talked to Fort Sanders to get their side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6427.02)|
| 1:47:11| Up until the loading incident, when I think it was clear that the officers were very frustrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6431.02)|
| 1:47:18| I really think that they were doing a pretty good job, and then their frustrations got the best of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6438.02)|
| 1:47:23| But I, too, think the problem really is Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6443.02)|
| 1:47:26| Fort Sanders has resources for loading large patients that cannot stand on their own or that are too weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6446.02)|
| 1:47:33| Why was there not a lift chair provided by the hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6453.02)|
| 1:47:37| Why was the hospital even discharging her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6457.02)|
| 1:47:39| I think a lot of the frustration people have is really misplaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6459.02)|
| 1:47:42| I think everyone should go to the next, I don't know, does Fort Sanders have board of director meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6462.02)|
| 1:47:47| That's where people need to be sitting and talking to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6467.02)|
| 1:47:50| Why did they do this? Why did Blount County do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6470.02)|
| 1:47:54| And then, you know, I do think that, you know, thanks to the body cameras, we can now see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6474.02)|
| 1:47:59| and I hope that the internal affairs investigation goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6479.02)|
| 1:48:02| and perhaps if we need to make policy changes that we'll make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6482.02)|
| 1:48:06| And, you know, until the internal affairs report is published,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6486.02)|
| 1:48:11| I think it's premature to start throwing a big paintbrush and say that everything about the police is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6491.02)|
| 1:48:18| I look forward to the report, and I have confidence that the report will be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6498.02)|
| 1:48:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6504.02)|
| 1:48:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6506.02)|
| 1:48:27| The next person signed up to speak is Charity McMish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6507.02)|
| 1:48:33| Ms. McMish, if you could start by saying your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6513.02)|
| 1:48:39| My name's Charity McNair, and I live at 310 West Jackson Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6519.02)|
| 1:48:45| I'm here tonight to be an advocate for Lisa Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6525.02)|
| 1:48:49| She did not have one at the hospital, nor did she have one when she was at the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6529.02)|
| 1:48:54| She had no one to advocate for her, and today I'm here to ask you to do what you're elected to do, advocate for Lisa Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6534.02)|
| 1:49:02| After arriving to Knoxville, she was failed by every aspect of our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6542.02)|
| 1:49:07| When she was in the hospital, she was alone begging for help, and Fort Sanders put her to the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6547.02)|
| 1:49:12| They asked for the Knoxville Police Department to come and remove her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6552.02)|
| 1:49:16| When the Knoxville Police Department showed up, they laughed at her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6556.02)|
| 1:49:19| They mocked her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6559.02)|
| 1:49:21| They threatened to stack charges on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6561.02)|
| 1:49:24| They told her that she was a liar as she died in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6564.02)|
| 1:49:30| That's how Lisa Edwards left this earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6570.02)|
| 1:49:34| The last word she heard was the mockery and the laughter as she was begging the officers for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6574.02)|
| 1:49:43| The point I want to make tonight is that this is not an abbreviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6583.02)|
| 1:49:50| This was not a few bad apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6590.02)|
| 1:49:52| This was the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6592.02)|
| 1:49:54| It was a pretty fair cross-section of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6594.02)|
| 1:49:57| What we saw was so horrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6597.02)|
| 1:50:00| We saw their indifference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6600.02)|
| 1:50:01| We saw their brutality to Lisa Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6601.02)|
| 1:50:04| We counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6604.02)|
| 1:50:05| Do you know how many times she said please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6605.02)|
| 1:50:08| Ninety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6608.02)|
| 1:50:10| Ninety times she said please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6610.02)|
| 1:50:13| Do you know how many times she said help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6613.02)|
| 1:50:16| Fifty times she begged for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6616.02)|
| 1:50:21| She wasn't struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6621.02)|
| 1:50:22| She wasn't resisting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6622.02)|
| 1:50:23| She was dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6623.02)|
| 1:50:26| She had a stroke on the left side of her body and she was unable to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6626.02)|
| 1:50:31| Now we're in the position where the police are blaming the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6631.02)|
| 1:50:34| The hospital is blaming the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6634.02)|
| 1:50:36| But regardless of how you want to proportion the blame, our public officials have failed Lisa Edwards and they have failed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6636.02)|
| 1:50:43| And I fear they're failing other citizens every day in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6643.02)|
| 1:50:49| What we are asking for you to do tonight is to do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6649.02)|
| 1:50:53| Just do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6653.02)|
| 1:50:55| You were elected to provide oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6655.02)|
| 1:50:58| We elected you to make a difference that our public servants are doing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6658.02)|
| 1:51:03| And we can see in that video that they didn't do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6663.02)|
| 1:51:06| Anybody can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6666.02)|
| 1:51:08| They're not being servants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6668.02)|
| 1:51:11| The last words Lisa Edwards heard on this earth shouldn't have been laughter and mockery and threats of the Knoxville Police Department who were hired to protect and serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6671.02)|
| 1:51:21| Something is broken and it must be fixed so this never happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6681.02)|
| 1:51:25| Lisa Edwards could have been your grandmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6685.02)|
| 1:51:28| She could have been your mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6688.02)|
| 1:51:30| She could have been your sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6690.02)|
| 1:51:32| Her brother is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6692.02)|
| 1:51:34| Any person with a good conscience who watched that video should have been horrified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6694.02)|
| 1:51:41| And there's people that are all over the world seeing this video and they are horrified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6701.02)|
| 1:51:47| We're not hearing anything from our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6707.02)|
| 1:51:49| We're not hearing anyone of consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6709.02)|
| 1:51:52| Be an advocate for Lisa Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6712.02)|
| 1:51:55| Be an advocate for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6715.02)|
| 1:51:57| Please do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6717.02)|
| 1:52:05| Next person signing up to speak is Constance Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6725.02)|
| 1:52:08| Ms. Every, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6728.02)|
| 1:52:14| My name is Constance Every, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6734.02)|
| 1:52:19| Hey, Knoxville, check this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6739.02)|
| 1:52:21| Lisa Edwards was a preventable death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6741.02)|
| 1:52:23| It never had to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6743.02)|
| 1:52:25| Because if we were proactive, you know, I've been here a long time, said do your job many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6745.02)|
| 1:52:31| But if we were proactive, starting all the way back to Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6751.02)|
| 1:52:35| This is for you too, white moderate, because you're tone deaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6755.02)|
| 1:52:38| Because if you were paying attention, we could have prevented Lisa Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6758.02)|
| 1:52:41| When Anthony Thompson Jr. happened, he was a high schooler in a bathroom that was approached by four officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6761.02)|
| 1:52:48| with a ranking officer, Stanley Cash, a lieutenant, who approached the bathroom to so-called, quote-unquote, disarm him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6768.02)|
| 1:52:54| However, the multiple rows of options that were present, you failed to choose every last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6774.02)|
| 1:53:01| including his mother, who is an employee of the Knox County school system, to simply walk him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6781.02)|
| 1:53:07| Instead, what happens, Officer Clabo goes in there, gun happy, and fires off several shots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6787.02)|
| 1:53:12| shooting his own co-worker and shooting Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6792.02)|
| 1:53:16| Here's my favorite part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6796.02)|
| 1:53:17| When you talk about giving care, they don't know how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6797.02)|
| 1:53:19| Because Anthony Thompson Jr. has been shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6799.02)|
| 1:53:21| And what does Stanley Cash do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6801.02)|
| 1:53:23| He doesn't call the 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6803.02)|
| 1:53:25| He doesn't radio in immediate medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6805.02)|
| 1:53:27| He puts handcuffs on Anthony Thompson Jr.'s body and goes to the sink and washes the child's blood off of his hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6807.02)|
| 1:53:34| Do you see how Lisa Edwards is starting to develop itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6814.02)|
| 1:53:37| Let's go a little farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6817.02)|
| 1:53:38| The body counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6818.02)|
| 1:53:39| Let's not forget, we fought India for those body counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6819.02)|
| 1:53:42| We made her commit on her last campaign to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6822.02)|
| 1:53:45| And then Amelia, myself, and Z, and Rick Roach, and many others stood here for a year after that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6825.02)|
| 1:53:52| and demanded those body counts continue to come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6832.02)|
| 1:53:55| Mind you, they chose the cheapest ones that was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6835.02)|
| 1:53:57| We saw three different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6837.02)|
| 1:53:58| There was one that was really good, great quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6838.02)|
| 1:54:00| And given I'm a taxpayer for my tax dollars, I wanted the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6840.02)|
| 1:54:03| But you gave us the cheapest version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6843.02)|
| 1:54:04| However, we'll go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6844.02)|
| 1:54:06| Those bodies' cameras also caught Trinity Clark being sexually assaulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6846.02)|
| 1:54:10| They also caught Robert Bailey with a supposed taillight-slash-headlight that was never, ever actually out or broken or busted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6850.02)|
| 1:54:17| So probable cause has already failed this standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6857.02)|
| 1:54:19| But we've seen before how the conflicting coroner reports where the hospital said he died of a heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6859.02)|
| 1:54:24| yet Charm Alley said he died of a drug overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6864.02)|
| 1:54:27| Are you seeing how Lisa Edwards continues to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6867.02)|
| 1:54:30| And so now we fast forward where we get the full-body count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6870.02)|
| 1:54:34| We're seeing once again, yes, the hospital and Knoxville Police Department are responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6874.02)|
| 1:54:40| But again, this is a breakdown of system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6880.02)|
| 1:54:43| The health care system is garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6883.02)|
| 1:54:45| The justice system is garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6885.02)|
| 1:54:48| Police immunity still exists, which allows this type of behavior to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6888.02)|
| 1:54:52| When Amelia Parker tried to pass the zero-tolerance policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6892.02)|
| 1:54:55| when Daniels was in the school board trying to do the memorandum agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6895.02)|
| 1:54:59| what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6899.02)|
| 1:55:00| Oh, the rubber stamp happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6900.02)|
| 1:55:02| So when you ask these people to do their job, I hate to tell you, young folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6902.02)|
| 1:55:05| it ain't going to happen unless the voters make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6905.02)|
| 1:55:08| You must vote different, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6908.02)|
| 1:55:10| You have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6910.02)|
| 1:55:11| Look at the failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6911.02)|
| 1:55:13| Indica Cannon is up for re-election right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6913.02)|
| 1:55:16| So if you put her back, then you're accepting the standard that she's shown us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6916.02)|
| 1:55:19| All she cares about is rich white men, wealthy agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6919.02)|
| 1:55:22| As far as homeless people, I didn't see her come down and shake your hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6922.02)|
| 1:55:25| but I did watch her shake these men in suits' hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6925.02)|
| 1:55:28| As far as poor people, I didn't see her come down and shake the poor people's hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6928.02)|
| 1:55:31| but I sure did watch her shake a lot of rich hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6931.02)|
| 1:55:34| As far as housing and other things that we are struggling with in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6934.02)|
| 1:55:37| I didn't watch her shake anyone that represents the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6937.02)|
| 1:55:40| but I sure did watch a whole lot of rich hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6940.02)|
| 1:55:43| So when you talk about things like Tommy Smith and what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6943.02)|
| 1:55:46| I sure have watched you do a lot of recode for Randy Boyd's baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6946.02)|
| 1:55:50| but when people need fences to protect their property, we got a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6950.02)|
| 1:55:53| That is why I am running, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6953.02)|
| 1:55:56| It is a must that we talk about the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6956.02)|
| 1:55:58| While India talks about baseball parks, I'm going to be talking about homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6958.02)|
| 1:56:01| While she talks about speed bumps and sidewalks, I'm going to be talking about affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6961.02)|
| 1:56:04| While she talks about whatever wealthy agenda like the pedestrian walkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6964.02)|
| 1:56:08| I'm going to be talking about this police department and New Orleans Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6968.02)|
| 1:56:12| finest, the most corrupted police department in the world, a liar as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6972.02)|
| 1:56:15| took a job down here, and we still don't know how he got hired in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6975.02)|
| 1:56:18| We will be talking about how he needs to be fired immediately from his job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6978.02)|
| 1:56:21| and I don't care what you and he goes get to get his job back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6981.02)|
| 1:56:24| He will not be the police chief of Knoxville under my administration nor my command.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6984.02)|
| 1:56:27| Hey Gwen, when are you going to speak up for the black people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6987.02)|
| 1:56:30| I watched Seema, I watched Amelia, you didn't say a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6990.02)|
| 1:56:32| Oh, that's because you're too busy helping rich men take over property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6992.02)|
| 1:56:35| instead of addressing things like that guy from the Greyhound bus station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6995.02)|
| 1:56:38| that was stuffed in the closet, that the same police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6998.02)|
| 1:56:41| and the district attorney have deemed as an unsuspicious theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7001.02)|
| 1:56:44| We have serious issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7004.02)|
| 1:56:46| I look forward to seeing you on the campaign trail in Indiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7006.02)|
| 1:56:48| I cannot wait to debate you and look forward to you standing around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7008.02)|
| 1:56:51| because there will be no Stephanie Wells, there will be no David,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7011.02)|
| 1:56:53| there will be nobody else to answer these questions but you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7013.02)|
| 1:56:56| Looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7016.02)|
| 1:56:57| 2023, Knoxville, get ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7017.02)|
| 1:56:59| Cost is every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7019.02)|
| 1:57:00| The mayor is coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7020.02)|
| 1:57:02| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7022.02)|
| 1:57:04| The next person signed up to speak is Abdullah Hussain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7024.02)|
| 1:57:06| Mr. Hussain, if you could state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7026.02)|
| 1:57:10| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7030.02)|
| 1:57:17| Hello, my name is Abdullah Hussain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7037.02)|
| 1:57:20| I live at 1124 Fox Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7040.02)|
| 1:57:26| I was born and raised in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7046.02)|
| 1:57:28| I know Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7048.02)|
| 1:57:30| I served as a student rep on the school board when she was a school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7050.02)|
| 1:57:35| and I hope everybody's doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7055.02)|
| 1:57:38| I'm going to give a little bit of information before I make a formal request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7058.02)|
| 1:57:44| In 2014, for about two months, Israel carpet bombed the Gaza Strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7064.02)|
| 1:57:52| killing, according to the U.N., 2,000 Palestinians, including 1,500 civilians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7072.02)|
| 1:57:59| 500 of whom were children, and 300 of whom were women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7079.02)|
| 1:58:05| In 2015, my teenage cousin was working the fields at our farm in the West Bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7085.02)|
| 1:58:12| on land that they have, and he was arrested by soldiers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7092.02)|
| 1:58:15| and imprisoned without trial for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7095.02)|
| 1:58:19| Last April, my teenage cousin was walking home from school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7099.02)|
| 1:58:23| and an Israeli sniper shot him in the leg with an exploding bullet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7103.02)|
| 1:58:27| which is illegal according to international law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7107.02)|
| 1:58:31| Doctors recommend that he amputate his leg, but he hasn't given up on it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7111.02)|
| 1:58:36| and he hobbles with it dangling by his side to and from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7116.02)|
| 1:58:41| Last May, Israeli snipers killed an American Christian reporter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7121.02)|
| 1:58:47| by the name of Shirin Abu-Aklah as she was pursuing a story in the West Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7127.02)|
| 1:58:53| And this afternoon, I received word from my sister| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7133.02)|
| 1:58:59| saying that Israeli warplanes bombed my hometown in Palestine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7139.02)|
| 1:59:04| killing one of my family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7144.02)|
| 1:59:07| Now, why am I bringing up international issues to a city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7147.02)|
| 1:59:13| and to a local government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7153.02)|
| 1:59:16| This isn't something that we should have to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7156.02)|
| 1:59:18| or that you should have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7158.02)|
| 1:59:20| This is federal government stuff, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7160.02)|
| 1:59:24| Except that I found out recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7164.02)|
| 1:59:29| that our mayor, who I deeply respect and who I voted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7169.02)|
| 1:59:36| is going to Israel in a few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7176.02)|
| 1:59:39| to strengthen ties between American mayors and the Israeli government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7179.02)|
| 1:59:47| the purpose of which is to strengthen the relationship between Israel and the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7187.02)|
| 1:59:53| I come today with two requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7193.02)|
| 1:59:57| First, Mayor Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7197.02)|
| 2:00:00| your very attendance in this program represents an unwarranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7200.02)|
| 2:00:04| and frankly irresponsible tacit approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7204.02)|
| 2:00:07| of the countless crimes and policies that break international law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7207.02)|
| 2:00:12| which are perpetrated by the Israeli government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7212.02)|
| 2:00:15| on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7215.02)|
| 2:00:18| These crimes and abhorrent policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7218.02)|
| 2:00:21| go against international human rights laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7221.02)|
| 2:00:24| that our government has sworn to uphold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7224.02)|
| 2:00:27| They go against the principles of upholding justice, equity, and compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7227.02)|

| 2:00:37| that are upheld and taught by your own church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7237.02)|
| 2:00:41| When you swore in as mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7241.02)|
| 2:00:43| you swore that you would discharge your duties as mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7243.02)|
| 2:00:46| faithfully, honestly, and impartially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7246.02)|
| 2:00:49| My first request, as a member of your constituency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7249.02)|
| 2:00:52| who voted for you and supported you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7252.02)|
| 2:00:55| is that I strongly urge you to cancel this trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7255.02)|
| 2:00:58| on the grounds of humanity and justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7258.02)|
| 2:01:00| And because you must learn more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7260.02)|
| 2:01:02| about the realities of the occupation of Palestine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7262.02)|
| 2:01:05| before going down this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7265.02)|
| 2:01:07| You have all these issues happening here at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7267.02)|
| 2:01:11| and you're going thousands of miles away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7271.02)|
| 2:01:14| to build ties with a foreign country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7274.02)|
| 2:01:17| that has an abysmal track record of human rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7277.02)|
| 2:01:21| I appeal to your wisdom and your oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7281.02)|
| 2:01:24| to serve honestly and impartially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7284.02)|
| 2:01:26| to cancel this trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7286.02)|
| 2:01:28| My second request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7288.02)|
| 2:01:30| is that I would love to set up a meeting with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7290.02)|
| 2:01:32| to discuss this issue in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7292.02)|
| 2:01:37| And, you know, we uphold human rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7297.02)|
| 2:01:41| we embrace compassion in every front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7301.02)|
| 2:01:44| but sometimes when it comes to Palestine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7304.02)|
| 2:01:46| it seems as if that's where we draw the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7306.02)|
| 2:01:49| However we can make that meeting happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7309.02)|
| 2:01:51| I'd love to make it happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7311.02)|
| 2:01:52| and I urge you strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7312.02)|
| 2:01:56| you know, in appealing to your humanity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7316.02)|
| 2:02:00| to please cancel this trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7320.02)|
| 2:02:02| Thank you so much for everything that you all do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7322.02)|

| 2:02:10| and give you all wisdom and guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7330.02)|
| 2:02:12| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7332.02)|

| 2:02:38| I'm not sure if your name is Mr. Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7358.02)|
| 2:02:41| Is he still present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7361.02)|

| 2:03:12| some bitterness in my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7392.02)|
| 2:03:15| I don't have a lot of bitterness for all of you officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7395.02)|

| 2:03:35| But my sister was not a bad person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7415.02)|
| 2:03:40| She was not a mean person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7420.02)|
| 2:03:42| She was not a dangerous person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7422.02)|
| 2:03:47| And I don't understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7427.02)|
| 2:03:50| and how this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7430.02)|
| 2:03:54| Her sons are not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7434.02)|
| 2:03:58| They live in Rhode Island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7438.02)|
| 2:04:01| They're still up there working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7441.02)|
| 2:04:04| They would like to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7444.02)|
| 2:04:06| but I told them I didn't want them here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7446.02)|
| 2:04:09| They have too much bitterness in their hearts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7449.02)|
| 2:04:15| and that would do no one no good right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7455.02)|
| 2:04:24| I don't know how this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7464.02)|
| 2:04:27| I don't know why this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7467.02)|
| 2:04:32| And it's been said that on the back of the patrol cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7472.02)|
| 2:04:39| it says to protect and to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7479.02)|
| 2:04:44| I didn't see no fine line underneath it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7484.02)|
| 2:04:48| that said protect the wealthy, the rich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7488.02)|
| 2:04:53| the well-educated, sports figures, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7493.02)|
| 2:05:01| I thought it said protect and serve all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7501.02)|
| 2:05:07| She was not protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7507.02)|
| 2:05:10| She was not served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7510.02)|
| 2:05:13| And I don't hold all the police officers accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7513.02)|
| 2:05:17| but there are some that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7517.02)|
| 2:05:22| I don't know how they can sleep overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7522.02)|
| 2:05:27| I don't see how their wives can lay beside them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7527.02)|
| 2:05:30| if they've seen this video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7530.02)|
| 2:05:32| And I've not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7532.02)|
| 2:05:33| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7533.02)|
| 2:05:34| I've not seen the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7534.02)|
| 2:05:36| I've seen maybe five minutes of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7536.02)|
| 2:05:39| That's all I can stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7539.02)|
| 2:05:42| It broke my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7542.02)|
| 2:05:45| She come back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7545.02)|
| 2:05:48| She was planning on living back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7548.02)|
| 2:05:50| She lived here for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7550.02)|
| 2:05:52| She wanted to come home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7552.02)|
| 2:05:55| but she wouldn't have known that she was coming home to die like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7555.02)|
| 2:06:03| This can't keep happening, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7563.02)|
| 2:06:07| It can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7567.02)|
| 2:06:08| It could be your mother, your sister, your brother, your daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7568.02)|
| 2:06:14| Somebody dropped the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7574.02)|
| 2:06:16| The hospital did, and these officers did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7576.02)|
| 2:06:24| And when it comes time for those that were involved in her death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7584.02)|
| 2:06:32| when they stand before God Almighty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7592.02)|
| 2:06:38| and he looks down at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7598.02)|
| 2:06:43| and says, is that Lisa Edwards blood dripping from your fingers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7603.02)|
| 2:06:52| I'm just curious to what they're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7612.02)|
| 2:06:56| I was too busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7616.02)|

| 2:07:03| or I wasn't trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7623.02)|
| 2:07:06| I thought everyone was trained in being human,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7626.02)|
| 2:07:13| having compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7633.02)|

| 2:07:56| and driving down the street to be abused or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7676.02)|
| 2:08:01| I'd like to say all you officers do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=7681.02)|
