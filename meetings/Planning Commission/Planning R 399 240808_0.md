| 0:14:17| Any other requests to postpone an item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| Yes, Steve Maddox, 100 Dalton Placeway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| Item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| And we have a question whether or not to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| That is based on that if, as we are working, our application is for a rezoning and a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=878)|
| 0:14:48| amendment to change the zoning to an industrial zoning for light industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=888)|
| 0:14:56| However, we feel like that the general commercial use would be a better zoning and would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| better for the city and better for the neighborhood and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| However, that zoning at this time does not include the uses that would need to be, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=907)|
| 0:15:16| would work on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| My office is just down the street two blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| I've been there over 20 years in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| I'm very familiar with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| This is a property at the corner of Enskip and Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| I'm representing a young man that owns that property, has done a fabulous job cleaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| up the front side of his property, would like to do the same with this vacant lot and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| old building that's on it, but the zoning is not working correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| It's like there's a hole in the zoning for this type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| So I guess I would like to have advice on should we postpone and try to work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| Planning Commission to get the zoning or something corrected, or should we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| and go for the industrial zoning that we have applied for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| Director Brooks, I'll give that one to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| Well, Mr. Maddox, I'm not sure that I can give you an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| I think maybe that's what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| You can postpone and allow additional discussion to be had between our office and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| but the city staff need to be involved if there's going to be a use, maybe a new use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| potentially identified that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| I don't have the answer for you right now, whether or not that would be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| So really it's ultimately up to you if you want to proceed with your request to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| to an industrial zone, or if you want to postpone this to allow for that additional conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| to see if something could be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| I've got a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Go ahead, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| I mean, is it possible to go ahead and read it on number nine, and then have a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| bit of discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Can he still postpone during that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| It would have to be, there would have to be a proper motion and second and a vote by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| Commission, but he could make that request at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Which we'd have to have right now anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| So I mean, I would just suggest maybe waiting until it's read and then we can have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| discussion and then we can decide as a body or where you're comfortable if we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| postpone it and the city get involved with the uses, but I would say let it be read and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| you can still postpone at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| That's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1059)|

| 0:24:46| The Knoxville Downtown Design Guidelines were adopted in 2007 to establish and transform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| downtown Knoxville into a vibrant, walkable hub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| The guidelines establish pedestrian engagement along frontage streets, aiming to create an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| outdoor room or atmosphere with active streets, sidewalks, parks, plazas, and building walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1501)|
| 0:25:12| Knoxville's street fronts are invaluable assets to define our city's character, vibrancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| and economic vitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| They serve as interfaces for commerce, culture, and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| Allowing parking garages to dominate these frontages wastes their potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| And I've asked staff to pull up the renderings, and you can see clearly that the parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| is the most imposing part of this design when you stand at Neyland or on Front Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1535)|
| 0:25:45| Street fronts should be pedestrian-friendly places, not monotonous and uninviting facades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| Projects like Regas Square, for instance, Marble Alley, have shown us the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| for such developments to drive commerce and community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Much remains to be done, particularly in reconnecting our city to the riverfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| This project site is a cornerstone for our city, as located adjacent to the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| Henley Street Bridge and on the Tennessee River, where 32,000 vehicles pass daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| The current proposal for a parking garage on Front Street undermines Knoxville's design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| vision, risking the creation of a pedestrian desert and derailing our aspirations to reconnect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1578)|
| 0:26:26| downtown to the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Knoxville's prominent interest to our city deserves a development that adheres strictly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| to the design guidelines, keeping Knoxville on a path to sustainable growth, architectural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1593)|

| 0:26:44| Planning Commission that's posted on the public comment sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1604)|

| 0:26:51| The parking garage should not be located on a street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1611)|

| 0:26:58| space to engage pedestrians and drive commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| Look at guideline B2C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Parking garage obstructs the sight lines to the historic Henley Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| I noticed in the agenda review, Commissioner Carson asked if there were guidelines that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| spoke to views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Well, there are guidelines that speak to views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Specifically, they talk about maintaining views to historic structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| Henley Street Bridge is identified as a historic structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| This obstructs the view to the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Look at guidelines B1A, B, C, D, and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| This building lacks a human or pedestrian scale along Front Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| The building presents a blank, monolithic parking garage instead of a dynamic streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| because it's not divided into modules until 60 feet above the street front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| This is a parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| This is not a part of our city that will drive commerce, that will drive pedestrian engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| This is not in accordance with the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| Look at guideline B2E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| The proposal does not incorporate a pedestrian-friendly plaza or any pedestrian amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| Those are the general guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Move on to the boulevard district guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Guideline A1A, the design lacks a lawn or landscape area separating the building from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| This is a very specific guideline that it violates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| There is no separation between the building lawn separating the sidewalk from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| Guideline A1C, the architecture and landscape doesn't complement adjoining buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| There are buildings like this in South Knoxville, but there are not buildings like this in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| A2A, there's no pedestrian entrance clearly oriented toward Front Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| Front Street is a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| There are other guidelines that are referenced in our letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| I would mention briefly that this presents a traffic issue that's not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| The intersection between Front Street and Locust is an obvious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| This design does not, and if you'll ask engineering, there are probably some improvements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| will be needed for this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| This design does not leave space to accommodate those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| In closing, we urge the Planning Commission to hold this project to established standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| By doing so, we can ensure Knoxville's continued growth and revitalization, making our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| a more vibrant and connected place for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Let us strive for a development that truly reflects the vision set forth in the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1781)|

| 0:29:52| We can do better than a garage on Front Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1792)|

| 0:32:21| Beginning November 16, 2022, the development team met informally at a workshop before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1941)|

| 0:33:10| There was lengthy discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| On the project, different design elements and recommendation of changes to different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=1993)|

| 0:34:03| Overlook Association spoke again in opposition, lengthy discussion by the design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| There were several members on the design review board that appreciated the revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| and changes, they liked the project and indicated support of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| However, there were a few members that still were hesitant and had design suggestions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| further revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2062)|

| 0:34:57| Planning staff described how the project's design plan satisfied and aligned with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| applicable design guidelines, and in fact, recommended that DRB approve the design plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| for the project and issue the certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2107)|

| 0:35:39| and redesign of these plans, we submit that we ask that you deny the appeal and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2139)|

| 0:36:06| Ms. Justice, would you like to add any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2166)|

| 0:36:31| decision to approve the certificate of appropriateness in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| We have followed closely as the applicant has responded to the recommendations and feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| of the DRB board, the planning staff recommendations, and the input from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| Based on that input, the design revisions have been made to address some of those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| and feedback, and that focus specifically on scale, massing, materiality, and the pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2219)|

| 0:37:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Counselor Sanders, if you would like, give you an extra minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| I object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Ms. Justice represents the city, and she works for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| The mayor appoints this body, so I object that this is an undue influence on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| so it shouldn't be regarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| In fact, I think this taints this whole proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2253)|

| 0:37:51| Can everybody hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| I'm still getting used to the new microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| The historical information that was provided to you, of course, is for your benefit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| have an idea of how the case got to where it is today, but it's important for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| to know, as a body, that this is a de novo review, so you're not bound by the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| that was made by the DRB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| It doesn't come to you with a presumption that they got it right or that they got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| This is your decision to make, so you need to make it based on your analysis, what you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| seen of the record, and what occurs at this public hearing, so I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| that you all understand that that historical information is provided so that you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| the process and the case file and how it got to you, but this is your decision to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| and you make it a new, it's a de novo or a new review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Does anybody have any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| All right, commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2322)|
| 0:38:51| Commissioner Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| I think it would do this body some good to not pretend that this appeal is in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| about the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| I think this is very clearly to everybody that lives in the community, has watched the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| news, lives downtown, this is the overlook condominiums, which sit as it stands right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| behind this property, and what these people are mad about is that this apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| is going to block their view, because when they bought their property, they failed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| realize that they didn't buy riverfront property, they bought riverview property, and so now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| they want to throw a temper tantrum and act like nobody can build tall buildings downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| on property that they own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| So what they've done is in April, they were mad about the height of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| Now in May they brought up something else, in June they brought up something else, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| the developer has complied and changed the design to meet the design standards, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| it looks fine to me, and now they want to talk about how this is all a parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| when you can very clearly see the storefront right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| They want to talk about how you can't see the Henley Street Bridge, I see it, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| look to the left, as we all know, it continues on down the river and I don't see a parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| garage blocking that view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| So what this is is a bad faith appeal by a group of entitled NIMBYs to try to stop a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| development that is desperately needed in this community, because they think that their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| view is more important than this developer's property rights to build this building, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| think that their view is more important than the desperate need for rental units in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| community, and there is nothing about this building that doesn't comply with any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| the applicable zoning regulations, ordinance, or laws in this community, in this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Let's be clear, the design review guidelines are guidelines, they are beautification suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| they are not standards, and we don't have to go by them, but they've gone by them anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| and now they want to say in bad faith that there's not a storefront, there's no pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| access, it's literally right there on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| And Mr. Sanders there made that objection because they're going to try to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| delay this, they want to take it to city council, and I'm sure they'll try to clog up Chancery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Court with their little temper tantrum about their view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| It's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| And I really honestly think that they need to, the people in the overlook need to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| God above that this is their biggest problem, and that they've got the time and the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| to clog up every government system that they can with this crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| And so with that, I'd like to make a motion to deny the appeal and approve the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| because there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| It complies with all the applicable design guidelines and all the applicable zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Okay, we have a motion to deny the appeal affirming the decision of the Design Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| Board, seconded by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| We have still more discussion here, and we'll go to Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| First of all, I have a question for staff about something I noticed in the packet of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| It looks like Front Street is being shown as a one-way, and I'm curious if that is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2522)|
| 0:42:11| of this development or if that's just a typo on the site plans that we're seeing, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| currently I believe Front Street is a two-way street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Anybody, staff, or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| I'd like to ask Joshua Fraze from City Engineering to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2541)|
| 0:42:28| I'm not sure if it's currently designated as one or two-way, but given the width of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| it, we would either require it to be one-way or modify and widened if they wanted it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2553)|
| 0:42:41| be two-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Past developments have shown modifications to make it two-ways, but this one, since it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| not showing a much wider section, it's just going to be the one-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Is that something that they have the ability to propose, and you all will allow them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2572)|
| 0:43:03| make that modification, or is that something that engineering would look at in plans review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| and determine, if they're making a request, whether or not to allow Front Street to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| one-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| I believe they would look at that during plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| This application showing that as a one-way has no bearing on whether or not it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| be a one-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| Would have no bearing on how you all would look at it in your review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Them showing it as one-way here, they're not widening it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| That's what we would prefer, but if they wanted to enter into discussions to widen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| that and do some other modifications, we'd allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| I just ask because I've driven Front Street a number of times, and I do think that having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| that as a two-way is a good access to avoid the congestion of Henley Street, but I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2639)|
| 0:44:08| sure if that would have any sway in the actual, it being in this packet, how that would affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| the actual application of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| So I just want to clarify that on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| I do have a design concern that I want to bring up and discuss, because the reason I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2661)|
| 0:44:32| I know that DRB did discuss this in depth and did review this project multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2672)|
| 0:44:41| However, to the point that's already been brought up, a lot of that discussion was around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2681)|
| 0:44:50| things like the view of neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| I think that having been to DRB a number of times and gone through those discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| I know that oftentimes when there's not as many things, other variables distracting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| the discussion of materials does come into play more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| So I think that this is something that in another case might have had more conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| My concern is with the fact that this is 18, or however many stories, and they're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2719)|
| 0:45:28| stucco for the siding material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| And my concern with that may not necessarily be, and I want to ask the applicant about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| this, see, just stucco can be a very resilient siding material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| It can be in multiple climates, our own included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| A lot of times stucco, when applied, especially here, gets applied as EFIS, which is the stucco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2749)|
| 0:45:57| that is backed with insulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| On these drawings, they're calling for hard coat stucco, which is true stucco, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2760)|
| 0:46:09| so is more resilient than EFIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| However, this also has a lot of penetrations with the decks, the balconies, going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| that siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| So I do think that from a long-term standpoint, because of where this is, it's such a prominent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| building, such a prominent site, you see it, you won't be able to go over Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| without seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| My concern is that thinking about how the guidelines want to keep downtown beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2796)|
| 0:46:46| and keep it in good shape, I think that stucco is a questionable material in how it fits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| I also don't know of, the only other building that I know of this size, or two buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| really that use stucco, are the one I mentioned at Agenda Review in Fort Sanders, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2821)|
| 0:47:10| the Regal Squares headquarters across the river, which I was told that when they recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| renovated that, they had to repair all that stucco and that large sections of the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| had come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| My concern is just that using stucco in something of this size is a maintenance, could be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2843)|
| 0:47:33| maintenance nightmare if it's not done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| So I wanted to ask the applicant if there is consideration of a panel-based system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2855)|
| 0:47:44| or if there's been conversations about stucco, do you all plan to use the hard coat stucco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2864)|
| 0:47:52| have you considered the maintenance aspects of that, and so just kind of give you the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| floor for a minute to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| Since I'm not really qualified, I'm going to have our architect come up and introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| himself and the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Ben Hudgens with Brock Hudgens Architects, address is 530 Means Street, Northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| That's Atlanta, Georgia, 30318.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Good question about stucco, and certainly warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| There were discussions with the DRB about the material use on the buildings along Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Wanted to concentrate brick along that facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| We think that's important, especially with the adjacent context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| For the riverside of the building, the stucco was considered for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| One is it is a big expanse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| The issues that you mentioned with stucco are largely in a wood frame context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| Using stucco on wood frame buildings, wood tends to move and settle over time, creates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| all kinds of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| In this case, we're a concrete frame building, metal stud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| We don't have that particular concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| We tend to prefer the use of stucco for high-rise condominium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| This is not condominium, but for that product type, which is super important to keep waterproofing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| considerations in mind, we prefer stucco to other panelized products, including metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| We think that we can better control some of those details in the joinery that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| It is three-coat, hard-coat stucco with the acrylic finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| It is true stucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| It's not Ephus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| The joints that are presented in the stucco, we think, help the scale of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| You can see, even in the rendered views where we're showing those score lines and joints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| the control joints in the stucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| We understand your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| In terms of the maintenance, again, the fact that we are a concrete frame building, metal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| stud goes a long way, but of course, the building upkeep and maintenance is a top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3000)|
| 0:50:09| Our client has to have the building be presentable in order to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| Does that answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| Really, I think that the structure aspect is one thing that I didn't see covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| Well, I could see that there was concrete, but that is a big factor in that, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| it's on wood or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| That's why I wanted to ask about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| I want to put it on the record that both DRB and this approval includes this showing hard-coat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3033)|
| 0:50:43| stucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| If we get to CDs and start value engineering for budget, and stucco gets subbed for EFIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3045)|
| 0:50:57| then I think that, even though visually that may be the same, that is a long-term visually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| could be a very different scenario, and I think should trigger a revisit to DRB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3063)|
| 0:51:11| With that, I do have one other thing I want to talk about, and it is the storefront on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| the bottom, the thing the opposition was discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| I did notice on the plans that the storefront is just on this corner, and it appears to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| be building amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| It's not a publicly facing use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| Let's give a little bit of a history here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| The first DRB presentation, there was a lot of conversation about the engagement along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| front, which currently is not great from a pedestrian environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| Basically a dirt road at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Including the sidewalk and the landscape there was always part of the plan, but the feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| from the DRB was it wasn't enough to help activate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| The reality is trying to put commercial space retail storefronts along front right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3126)|
| 0:52:14| tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| That's a tough sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| What we did agree to do was push the entire garage down so that it actually comes all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| the way down to front avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| We've got type one construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| We increased the height of that vertical clearance at that first floor, which allows us to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| back when more retail viable and introduce retail storefronts along the entire frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| of front avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| In the meantime, again, feedback from the DRB said, well, that's great, but we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| something there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| We agreed that, particularly at this intersection of locust and front, to go ahead and introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| storefront, introduce an interior program there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| We've got artist workshop, bike storage, bike workshop, pet spa, those sorts of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| that front that street to provide some amount of activation until the time in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| that retail is viable here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| Again, it's set up concrete, type one construction to accommodate retail as soon as it's viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3190)|
| 0:53:20| On the parking garage, what is the material, the vertical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| Aluminum, thin screening, so pre-finished aluminum, no maintenance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| Again, we studied different ways to approach the garage screen, even had a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| workshop about different ideas, whether it's vegetation or screening materials or expressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| We studied a lot of options and ended up here after getting feedback from the DRB in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| I dream with many other people, not only in this room but in Knoxville, that the riverfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3234)|
| 0:54:01| on this side of the river be very accessible and that we don't have to go over basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3241)|
| 0:54:11| a highway to get to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| I hope that one day that is the case, but currently the opposition is trying to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3255)|
| 0:54:25| a point of the pedestrian aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| I think that the best they can do here is create that inviting entry corner and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| a sidewalk so that residents on a walk can get around the building, can go down front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| but I don't see a draw beyond walking down front, I don't know what just happened, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3285)|
| 0:54:54| because you can't get over Neyland Drive from right here without playing Frogger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3294)|
| 0:55:05| There's nothing that, even if they put stores down here, those would just be empty storefronts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| which a parking garage is going to feel safer than an empty storefront down here and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3310)|
| 0:55:20| better actually, and especially with the treatments that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| I agree with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| There are concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| The concerns that have been brought up, what I mean by that is just I understand them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| but I don't think that they're appropriate in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| I hate it for the people who feel negatively impacted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| I've stared at it a hundred times trying to imagine a way to avoid some of those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| but I don't think that there's an appropriate solution there, so I agree with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| So did the architects there rest your concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| So let's go to Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| I'm sorry, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| Let's go to Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| I just have, first of all, I want to say I commend everyone involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| It sounds like there was a lot of engagement between DRB and the people in that area, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| residents in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| You know, we don't usually see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| I really appreciate the going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| I look at the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| I think it's been improved from the interaction, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| I understand Commissioner Overton's frustration, and I'm sorry you feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| I know, you know, as a commission, this is the process that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| The appeal process is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| I know that the Overton group spent $500 to come for us, and I appreciate you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| voicing your concerns and taking it, you know, making the appropriate statements and addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| this before our body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| The one thing I wanted to ask, and maybe the architect will need to address this, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| was, you made a comment when you were discussing the stucco that you had pushed the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| forward to Neyland in order to accommodate that storefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| And I don't know how true to scale these renderings are, but I was a little concerned when I saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| that the Henley Street Bridge, the pier, that pier that's closest to Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3451)|
| 0:57:40| was going to be obstructed in this last rendering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Is that true, or is this rendering, was this just an oversight, or is this the way it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| going to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| If you can look at this June 20th, it looked like it was, that final pier that goes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3471)|
| 0:57:59| Henley Street Bridge is obstructed by this design, and, you know, I love that bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| and I do know that part of the design review board's discretion is to discuss streetscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| and I do feel like maybe by pushing it forward, and maybe you can correct me, that that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| obstructing some of the uniqueness of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| So, when I mentioned moving the garage to activate front, we actually pushed it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| an entire floor, because it had previously sat up with a more opaque wall at grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3507)|
| 0:58:34| so we pushed it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| We didn't push it closer to the river or closer to Neyland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| The reality is that the bridge and front and hill are not perpendicular, so the angle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3520)|
| 0:58:48| the bridge, it's going to change the perception of what you see, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| So they are not at a right angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Where this view is taken, and this was actually photographed, our renderer has somebody actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| go and take the photography at the location to get the building placed correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| The reality is you don't really get this perspective driving, because Locust is so steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3548)|
| 0:59:16| By the time you get to Neyland, you're past the building anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| So this is the correct placement of the building relative to the bridge and to that last pier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| Did that change from May 15th to June 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| So we, through these concept renderings and some of the early design, there were different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3573)|
| 0:59:41| angles that were shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| There was a concern raised that maybe it wasn't being represented correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| So that's when we went back, verified the survey, field verified the actual location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| of the piers, had somebody go back and a professional photographer photograph this for the backplate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| of the rendering, had the professional renderer re-render the building in this correct placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| So that may be where the confusion is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| So if I was to be driving down Neyland, I would have a better view of those piers than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| if taken looking from this spot where you took the photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Yeah, I just quickly wanted to kind of, I guess, refresh my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| I mean, for this building to be zoned DKB, that's similar to kind of earlier cases we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| seen both on State Street and then on Henley Street, and those properties we decided didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| require kind of street-facing retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| So I think it's kind of above and beyond for street-facing retail to be down here on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| Front Street, which we, or the potential for future retail, I should say, to be on Front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| Street, which, as we've said, is kind of a glorified dirt road at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| And so I think if we think that State Street and Henley Street aren't in current conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| to support kind of full retail, we'd be hard-pressed to make the argument that Front Street, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| know, can support it at this point too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| So I would just, yeah, commend the forward-looking kind of vision of this development to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| And then I was just looking quickly on kind of Google Maps that you drop yourself down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| on Front Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Kind of the remainder of the bridge that is covered at this point, they're not even the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| open piers at this point, but it's kind of the facade of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| So from my perspective, that's the less attractive part of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| It's kind of a flat wall as opposed to kind of see-through piers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| So I'd suggest that the best part of the bridge is still visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Okay, so the motion on the floor is to deny the appeal affirming the decision of the Design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3702)|
| 1:01:52| Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| So a vote in yes is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| Sometimes this gets confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| We'll make sure everybody's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| We all clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Because we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3720)|

| 1:03:11| Let me stop right there for just a minute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| With there not being any opposition, I'll just kind of sum this up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| When this was subdivided, someone left this piece of property that is not part of Taylor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| Fugate's property as the intended access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| It's approximately, I think, 50 feet long, 15 feet wide, which at that time met the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| Ms. Fugate purchased this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| It got past mortgage underwriters and title companies that the plat had never been recorded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| and that the requirements had changed to a 25 foot access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3827)|
| 1:03:54| We're only going to use about 10 feet of it anyway for the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| It's just for the single house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| So we would ask that you would approve this variance so that the Fugate family can move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| to our wonderful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3844)|

| 1:04:57| Proposed plan designation is light industrial, existing land use is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| This will require three, I believe it's three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| First staff recommendation is to deny the light industrial land use classification because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| it is incompatible with surrounding development and changing conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| Second motion, deny the light industrial land use classification because it is incompatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| with surrounding development and changing conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| That's concerning the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| And then on the rezoning, motion three, recommendation, deny the industrial mixed use district because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| it is incompatible with surrounding development and changing conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| I'm present as representative for the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| I'm Steve Maddox, Maddox Construction, and my office is at 100 Dalton Place Way in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| Tennessee, about a block and a half south of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| So I'm very familiar with this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Thank you, Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Did we have someone sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| No opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Is there someone who wanted to consider postponing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| Is he not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| I'm not hearing from anybody, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| No, but remember, could you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| Just bear with us one minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| ...that he wanted to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3979)|
| 1:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| Mr. Maddox, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| So we're asking for this to be rezoned into the light commercial with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=3995)|
| 1:06:43| amendment and the one-year plan amendment because the uses that are going to go onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| this property are going to be, they're going to be a commercial use, but they're not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| that the commercial code now says for neighborhood commercial, this is things like hair salons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| beauty shops, ice cream parlors, and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| I'm very familiar with this market, and that's not the types of uses that are going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| in on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| They're just not going to work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| The young man that owns this property also owns the one in front there where he bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| an old gas station and totally redid it, beautified it, made it very nice for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| but inside there is a driveline shop where he rebuilds driveshafts for trucks and cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4046)|
| 1:07:33| and all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| For this property that we're trying to rezone, this is going to be things like air conditioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| companies, plumbers, electricians, painters, carpet cleaning companies, and things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| The neighborhood commercial doesn't allow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| I've met with the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| I've met with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| I've met with the city councilman in this area and all, and the city councilman, everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| agrees that the types of uses that we're talking about is what's going to work there, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| a beauty salon is not going to work there and it's not going to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| What I'm afraid of is this young man is going to go in there and spend a million and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| $2 million, building a nice new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| He wants to build something that's going to have a very nice facade on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| He wants to screen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| No outside storage yards, parking, truck parking, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| He doesn't even want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| He wants to actually beautify the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| That's the lot right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| If you look at his driveline shop there in front, you'll see what a nice job he did with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| an old gas station that's from down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| In talking with everybody we've talked to, we've talked to 20 people from staff, city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| codes, and the planning edges, and the councilman, and everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| The types of uses that are going to go in there that don't fit in a neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| and they're telling us, well, the only way that you can put that in there is to go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| this light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Well, light industrial doesn't sound exactly right to us because this is not manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4150)|
| 1:09:17| They're not going to be creating smoke and dust and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| They're going to be more like where a plumber operates his business out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| He'll have one or two trucks that he uses for his business, but it's not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| like a fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| They're not going to be stacking stuff outside and piling it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| So I am confused at what we really need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| I've been doing this for 40 years and I've never seen it in a situation where the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| you can't get the zoning to match what the use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| But with this new zoning, there's holes in it where it doesn't accommodate for certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| types of businesses within the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| And that's kind of the quandary that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| And we'd just like to solve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| And as I mentioned, I would be okay with postponing and getting the zoning fixed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| whatever way that needs to be done so that the uses could be in a commercial zoning as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| opposed to an industrial zoning if that can be done, if the staff will work and accommodate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| help to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| But otherwise, we need a light industrial or this young man's going to go in there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| he's going to build a million and a half dollar building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| It's going to sit there empty and he'll go bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| Thank you, Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| And we have no opposition, so we'll toss it to commission here for Vice Chair Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4237)|
| 1:10:45| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| I think this is more of a procedural question for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| I went through and looked at the use matrix in the city, especially for CG, the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| What you're describing to me is more office warehouse type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| You'll have maybe a few hundred feet of an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| Somebody can walk in, but maybe you're storing an air conditioner unit in the back, inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| In the county, I think that's even allowed in OB, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| It's not a noxious use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| But that said, looking at the use matrix, there's nothing even close to that description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| that would fall under it, just like what you were saying in the general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| Is there an opportunity for a similar use determination, or would this be a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| where something else is just added to the use matrix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| Mr. Huber, in the city, there is no similar use determination process as part of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| so that's not something that we could consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| The city did determine where this use falls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| They have that function of administering the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| There is the potential that a new use that wasn't previously identified could be identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4323)|
| 1:12:10| and added to that use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| I'm not sure at this point in the process of whether or not that use could be identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| We'd have to have more discussion with the applicant as well as with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| What would be a reasonable time frame for that contemplation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| Well, in terms of if there was to be a use that could be identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| I think that would take at least a month of conversations with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| It's the city's decision ultimately, plans review and inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| Then we'd have to go through the process of adding that use to the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| This body would review it and vote on it, and then city council would have the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| I would say about three months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| I'm sorry, I didn't hear what would be the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Just a rough timeline is 90-ish days by the time it goes through all of the planning to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4379)|
| 1:13:06| Prior to that, the inner workings of building codes and planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4386)|
| 1:13:13| We talked with Knoxville City Codes, several people with Knoxville City Codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| and they agree that the type of use that we're talking about would be more compatible in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| But they say, well, we're following the code, and the code says you have to go light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| That's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| I'm just trying to solve the problem here, and like I say, kind of at a quandary on how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4412)|
| 1:13:39| Yeah, and I think you've identified a potential concern that they're willing to consider and contemplate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4419)|
| 1:13:48| I just want to be clear, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| We have not identified another path forward to add that use yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| That's not something that has been discussed in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| The city did determine, as Mr. Maddox said, that industrial general is the use that would best fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| with how they have described this particular use, this contractor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| That's where it would best fit as of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| I just want to be very clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| It's still a potential that we wouldn't be able to land on a use within the next 90 days if we were to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| So I don't want to overpromise something that we can't deliver on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| So I think the challenge, Mr. Maddox, that they're constrained, or maybe even we're constrained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| is the criteria used to change a plan amendment and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4468)|
| 1:14:35| So that's where everybody's kind of stuck right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| You have the opportunity to allow this body to vote on the light industrial or request a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4482)|
| 1:14:51| If you're going to request a postponement, I would ask staff what recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| how long of a postponement would you recommend if that's what he was seeking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4497)|
| 1:15:06| Would you go 30 and just keep requesting a 30 if need be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4506)|
| 1:15:16| I would recommend 30 days with the potential that it could be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4516)|
| 1:15:29| I don't want to speak on behalf of my city colleagues and what their workload looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| We'd have to arrange those meetings and have those conversations, but I think a minimum of 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| I believe with the lack of having a determination made and whether or not it would be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4539)|
| 1:15:53| I think what we would like to do is go ahead and move forward with the request for the light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| And if the commission felt like it was good to limit this in some way as to say, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4560)|
| 1:16:08| okay, we'll grant it, but you can't have outdoor storage or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| we would be good with that because, as I mentioned, that's not the intent of this property at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4572)|
| 1:16:19| That's part of our challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| We can't condition it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| If we could, it'd probably be a potentially good solution, but we don't have the ability to condition it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| Okay, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| So I'll ask for the light industrial, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| All right, let's toss it to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Let's see, we've got lots of lights now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| So Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| Mr. Maddox, I was just going to say, you know, when we're making these determinations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| we're not looking at your use because, you know, you might sell the property or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4607)|
| 1:16:55| Owners might take, another owner might take ownership of that, and it would be a much more intensive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| It could be a much more intensive use surrounded by a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| And so when I'm having to review this, I'm going to vote for a denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| because I don't see this piece of property being appropriate for a lot of the uses that are in this light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4631)|
| 1:17:19| Well, I would just like to point out that the property we're talking about, small here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| the building that we're talking about would be like 6,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| So there's not much heavy industrial or anything like that that could take place in that size building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| It's more, as mentioned earlier, this is like office warehouse type stuff, office showroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4654)|
| 1:17:42| It could be like a carpet salesman, carpet sales company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| and they might have an office with showroom space or tile, say ceramic tile shop, those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| which are not allowed in this neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| I understand, but again, if the business sells,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| it's leaving that property open to much more intensive development past the current ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| And it could create a lot more traffic noise, regardless of what the building looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| That would be not good for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| And if it's denied, the property is going to sit there empty and vacant and look like it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4698)|
| 1:18:26| which would be worse, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| Well, Ms. Hillman, I'm sorry, go ahead, finish, Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| Ms. Hillman, if you don't mind, just list out some of the potential uses in light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| I think we're trying to paint a picture here of what potentially could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| and I think you could better communicate it with some of the potential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| Sure, so light industrial is the land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| and it permits industrial mixed use, regional industrial, and general industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| Okay, so in some of the uses of general industrial and the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| could you give us maybe some of the more intensive uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| So with their specific rezoning request, which is IMU, many of the permitted uses are much lighter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4752)|
| 1:19:26| such as an art gallery, art fitness studio, community center, daycare center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4766)|
| 1:19:36| However, it does permit general industrial, which is defined as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4776)|
| 1:19:46| when I say general industrial, I mean that as a defined use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| which is really more about manufacturing the potential for trucking traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| and maybe some noxious impacts, although it is defined as being in an enclosed area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| and maybe some outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| But yes, with the light industrial land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| more intensive zoning could be considered in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| Do you mind if I respond to that real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| My name is Dalton Maddox with Maddox Companies, one under Dalton Placeway as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| and absolutely please correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| but in our discussions with the zoning and coming to these ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| it was covered that under industrial mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| no manufacturing could actually be completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| that the heaviest use for it was assembly when looking through the specific language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Now, again, if I misunderstand that, please correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| but I feel like that's probably important to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| is that to my understanding, manufacturing is not possible under this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| I think the purpose of neighborhood commercial is to get local businesses in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| that serve the area, serve the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| and in the end, this use would be doing that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| We're talking about, well, no, neighborhood commercial would allow that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| and under what we're seeking for industrial mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| local businesses are still the target here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| That would still be the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| It would still be serving the community through that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| and bringing in additional opportunity for jobs and growth in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| So I just wanted to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| I will clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Ms. Hilton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| So industrial general as a use is permitted by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| in the industrial mixed use district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| which is defined as research and development activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| and the manufacturing, compounding, processing, packaging, storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| assembly, and or treatment of finished or semi-finished products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| from previously prepared materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| where such activities are conducted wholly within an enclosed building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| A general industrial use may also include a showroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| accessory sales of products related to the items manufactured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| or stored on site, and or outdoor storage for materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| related to processes on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| My thinking is along the same lines as Commissioner Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| just being concerned about what happens when you make a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| that's definitely making it a more intensive usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| And, you know, if you were not the person standing before us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| but somehow the property changed hands, that zone stays there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| It's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| And I'm looking at the map right now, and it's saying neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| and so I'm thinking this is the vision that that area of town has had for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| itself, and I really appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| You know that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| You know what's going to work well there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| And you can see the vision for this new idea that the person is trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4964)|
| 1:22:51| execute, but it doesn't fit neighborhood commercial as it's defined now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| and light industrial is not what that area is supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4977)|
| 1:23:04| So I understand your quandary here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| but everyone here is trying to make sure that they're making good decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| about the land use, not your specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| I can't support changing the staff recommendation because of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| I would support a postponement just to see if there's anything else that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| could be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| But as it stands right now, I couldn't support the light industrial for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| I think similarly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| I probably am struggling with the light industrial a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| given potential for future more intensive uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| I do wish that kind of neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| as it was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| did accommodate more kind of typical services like a plumber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| a neighborhood plumber seems like an appropriate use for that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| I guess I also wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| I'm admittedly not intimately familiar with this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| but just in looking at Google Maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| it looks like there are kind of hair salons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| barber shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| taco shop across the street from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| So I guess I would maybe question whether, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| CN is an inappropriate zone for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| I do think it's probably appropriate based on what's kind of in existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| there in terms of other commercial neighbors at this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| But yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| it would also probably support a postponement to see if there's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| options for seeing this use exists in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| in CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| So the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| I noticed that the sector plan on this shows GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5073)|
| 1:24:40| So I wanted to ask staff would CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5080)|
| 1:24:47| especially because they're CG adjacent zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| would CG be appropriate here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| And without doing a full analysis, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| do you think that that's something that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| could be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| And while staff is looking at that, the reason I ask is, you know, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| we've seen similar problems like this where the use matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| both in the city and County does not cover all uses that get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5111)|
| 1:25:18| that happened on a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| And we we've seen it multiple times before where we've had to redo or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| reinterpret possible uses. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| I think that the applicant is not, we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| not trying to put a factory here. It's not their desire to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| doesn't seem to be their desire to put a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| turn it into a truly industrial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| It is one of those situations where trying to find a title for the use has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| led to seems broad enough to put it in this category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| And this category is allowed under this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| And I think that from some of the things you've described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| it seems like there could be other ways of looking at those under the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| matrix, maybe as industrial craft or retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| you mentioned a showroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| maybe let's see office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| There's a few other uses that are permitted under CG one that are CG in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5182)|
| 1:26:30| general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| that I think that the individual uses you've discussed could fall under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| And if staff, you know, looking at this, it's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| got the GC sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| I know that the one year plan, well, I think the one year plan is MDRO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| which is permitted as a maybe land use allowed under GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5210)|
| 1:27:00| But when I look at uses or zones recommended for GC, I see office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| OP, CG, CH and CR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| So with the current designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| I don't even see NC, the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| So I really wonder if, and this probably happens in a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| if CG is a solution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| So I know I asked a question and they kept talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| What are your thoughts on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| I think that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| the question that you asked is something that if there was a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| we would be able to explore more in depth and provide some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| context and a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| And so to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| I know that you said you'd want to proceed with the industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| I think if you approve or deny here, you're going to get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| go to the next step and have the same conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| And in the end, if it leads to a denial, you're going to have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| to use it, you're just going to be requesting a different zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| So I think a postponement to discuss those options and maybe better define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| what those potential uses would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| might actually save a lot of time and money in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| So those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| I don't know how many people have actually spent much time over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| off Central and in Skip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| I mean, it just feels industrial to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| I mean, there's other industrial stuff around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| I mean, this is not like some kind of bustling, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| retail commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| You know, two other things I think we ought to consider a little bit is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| Mr. Maddox has developed a lot of property right down the street from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| And it's a pretty high end kind of office, you know, development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| I don't think he's going to be pushing for something that he thinks is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| to devalue his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| I also don't see any opposition, you know, here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| I mean, we say there's neighborhoods all around it and all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| I mean, normally people would be down here with pitchforks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| if it was going to be a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| Given the circumstances, I could certainly see this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5366)|

| 1:29:35| And so I think it's probably worth just putting it out there and seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| And I'd like to make a motion to amend the North City sector plan from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| neighborhood commercial, general commercial, to light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| We've got a motion from Commissioner Browning and seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| Anderson on the plan amendment going from neighborhood commercial to light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5397)|
| 1:30:06| industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| We have more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| Did I say that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| If I may, I'd like to add one point that was just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| It was a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| We have met with the community group there, the NSKIPP Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5417)|
| 1:30:25| Association, and they're fine with the plans that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| They like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| I mean, this thing's going to have a brick front on it and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| So that was a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| I failed to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| I have great respect for Commissioner Browning's comments and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| others, and I think we're all wanting to get to the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| However, I think some are just a little cautious as to how we do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| because we have specific criteria on plan amendments, and we have to cite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| those reasons, and right now I'm coming up with a challenging reason to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| change the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| I really believe if we had 30 days, I know there's a motion here, and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| talk about that here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| I really believe if we had 30 days to work this out that there's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| chance it would be worked out in the best form possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| Is that so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| Should I then postpone right now at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| Well, I don't know what we should do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| I'm going to talk to Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| I don't know if you want to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| I just, I really believe this body wants to accommodate what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| trying to do, but we want to do it in the right manner, and I think that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| I see a lot of heads nodding here, and if you just give us 30 days, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| I can talk Commissioner Browning into giving us 30 days, and Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| Anderson, I think we'll, I'd like to think we'll end up in a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| I'm in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| I believe that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I just would want to be able to work with the staff and try to get this solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| Let me ask Commissioner Brown if he'd be willing to work, to change his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| mind for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| I mean, I think if everybody's in agreement, especially the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| then I would rescind my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| Commissioner Anderson, you go with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| We still had Vice Chair Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| You want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| Just in general, I mean, it looks like we're moving towards a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| postponement, which I do think is the best thing, but just in general, as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| look at it, I do understand where staff is struggling because of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| what it shows right now, but to me, from a reality of it, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| as Commissioner Browning mentioned, it is very industrial feel out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| I mean, it's literally 170 feet away from another industrial, general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| I mean, literally across the street almost, and it's down the street from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| industrial mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| There's even more industrial-type properties further in, further off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| central towards more of the residential side versus being up on the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| I'm familiar with the area, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| We're building 100 apartments right down the street, but it is a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| I like the idea of having good-paying jobs in that area with a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| quality-built building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| So I think everybody here is in support of what you're wanting to do, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| do agree with Commissioner Chairman Hill that we all want it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| Let's just do it the right way in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| So with that, I guess we need a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| Commissioner Browning, you look like the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| Motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| We have a motion to postpone by Commissioner Browning and seconded by...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| I'll second if he's not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| I'm not putting him on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| For a 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| For a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| So do we have any other lights, any comments that anyone would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| share before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| If not, all in favor to postpone for 30 days say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5662)|
| 1:34:36| Agenda item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| Applicant is Coquilla Estates, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| Location, north side of Esri Drive, west side of Jacksboro Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| 1.34 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Present plan and zoning designation is LDR-RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| Proposed plan designation is MDR, medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| Existing land use is office single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| First recommendation regarding the sector plan is to deny the medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| density residential land use classification because it does not meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| the criteria for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| Motion number two related to the one-year plan is deny the medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| density residential land use classification because it does not meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| the criteria for a one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| Motion three, staff recommendation related to the rezoning is approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| the RN2 district because it is consistent with the existing low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| density residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| And do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| I'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| This is one where the application originally was to ask for the medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| density residential sector plan and one-year plan amendment and then to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| have the property rezoned to RN4 with the intent that that zoning would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| allow there to be some small scale multifamily residential on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| As part of the process, I postponed this from last month because Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5778)|
| 1:36:24| Malone with Fountain City Town Hall reached out to me and asked if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| could have a neighborhood meeting about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| And I postponed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| We did have a good conversation about what my client wanted to do on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| property and about the zoning and the sector plans and whether that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| what we were asking for would be appropriate at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| If you don't know Ms. Malone, Fountain City Town Hall, they're very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| informed as to the zoning ordinance and the ins and outs of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| So it was a nice conversation that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| Planning staff came back and made their recommendation to deny the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| amendments but to approve a rezoning not from RN4, which we originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| requested, but to RN2, which would be compliant with the existing LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| sector plan and one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| After discussing that with my client, we are in agreement with staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| I guess procedurally, we can vote down the plan amendments or I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| withdraw them either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| I think we get to the same place one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| But the zoning request for the RN2 is what we would like to proceed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| Councilor Blakeney, you want to advise us here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| Can we simply withdraw those two, the first two motions and just address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| I mean, my view is that unless Amy disagrees, my view is that you'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| That's what we'll do then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| We'll accept the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Do we need that in a motion or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| I think I would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| So chair will entertain a motion to withdraw the motion number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5887)|
| 1:38:14| Let me get back to it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| Related to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| Before we get to this, let's let the opposition speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| My name is Anita Reyes and I live at 3219 Esri Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5907)|
| 1:38:34| We were just going to say as homeowners there that we definitely agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| with the staff recommendation to deny both the low density to medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5917)|
| 1:38:44| density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| I mean, obviously we would like for them to remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| Low density RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| RN2 would still, we feel, would preserve the nature of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| our residential single family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| Because we're concerned with the congestion, the traffic right there at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| that intersection of Esri and Jacksboro with Central High School, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| fire hall right there on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| So we are in agreement with the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| We can make a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| I'm making a motion to withdraw the first MDR request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| We have a motion by Commissioner Adams to withdraw the medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| residential land use request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| We have a second by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| I'll make a second motion to withdraw the MDR land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=5994)|
| 1:40:05| We have a motion to withdraw the medium density residential land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| classification as it relates to the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| We have a second by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| Chair will entertain a motion on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| I'll make a motion to rezone, to approve the RN2 rezoning because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6025)|
| 1:40:32| it's consistent with the existing LDR land use classification based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| upon staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| We have a motion by Commissioner Adams to approve the RN2 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| because it's consistent with the existing low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| land use classification, seconded by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| Agenda item 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| Applicant, R. Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Location, southwest side of Calloway Street, southeast of University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| Avenue, approximate size of tract, 4,046 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| Present zoning, RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| Zoning requested, RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| Existing land use, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| Staff recommendation is to deny the RN4 district because the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| does not meet the intent of the RN4 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| Chair, may I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| When we heard this case at agenda review, we heard this case in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| combination with another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| Will we be doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| Nathaniel Shelso, 237 Denerick Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| I'm here representing the Old Mechanicsville Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| Interest Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| I'm a board member and their treasurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| I think we're going to have to modify my plaque to put that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| Now, we actually just reorganized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| We got a city grant to hold a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| The organization dates back to forming in the late 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| From what I understand, the roots were to organize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| to actually create the historic overlay that exists in Old Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| That overlay is actually where our neighborhood organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| boundary is with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| But we have had members and one of our past presidents lived outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| that exact boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| So we kind of, as you guys know, a lot of neighborhood groups weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| on cases very close to them, like two blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| So we had 30 people at our election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| and we sort of represent about 110 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| So we oppose the R and 4 zoning for all the reasons that the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| report details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| These are two very small lots that don't meet the width requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| They don't meet the square footage requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| Additionally, we understand there are other R and 4 properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| like that one right in between, which did meet those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| There are others throughout our neighborhood which seem to have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| placed that way because they were existing duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| and with recode in 2020 R and 4 seem to probably be the best zone to throw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| on that to make it match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| But, you know, we are not a bunch of NIMBYs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| We are very supportive of the middle housing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| When I was on this body, I was informing all of my neighbors about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| that process would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| Doing some kind of calculations on these two lots, a duplex on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| which we are all fine with through the middle housing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| We didn't oppose a BZA variance that was sought in order to sort of make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| that work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| That's an equivalent to about 20 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| By requesting R and 4 and trying to go for a second principal use with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| another duplex, which the applicant has stated that he intends to do in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| rear of these properties, that's effectively over 40 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| So I don't think that that is the solution to our housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| and we're certainly not against density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| So we're really afraid about the precedent that this could set in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6272)|
| 1:44:38| expanding R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| And though we know the applicant well, he's our neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| he has restored or rehabbed many structures in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6283)|
| 1:44:50| we don't understand that or we don't believe that he needs this in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| to save the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| The properties have been vacant for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| They were originally purchased in 2016 and 2017 for a total of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| about $28,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| I think this is a very clear example of demolition by neglect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| and it seems disingenuous to then say, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| I need a more intense use and a second principal use under the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| housing code, which we still really aren't sure how that would work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| the dimensional standards that the middle housing code has brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| But that's another section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| Other comments that the neighborhood has brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| we've seen a lot of people say, oh, I support a garage duplex in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| But what they really aren't fully understanding, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| is that this is a rezone request for R and 4 that could set some precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| that we don't want to see in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| The plans show a total rehab of the structure to replace all the siding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| with hardy board, install vinyl windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| We've considered the fact that this is in a National Register historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| district, though not in an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| And those plans retain no original historically contributing attributes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6367)|
| 1:46:13| So to us, whether they get rehabbed without this rezone or they get rehabbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| with it, they're no longer historically contributing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| If they have to get torn down and rebuilt entirely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| there's no historic attributes still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| You're literally, he's only claiming to save the footprint of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| which is not necessarily historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| You know, we wouldn't necessarily oppose this if perhaps there was a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6394)|
| 1:46:40| maybe he could apply to be included in our historic overlay at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| We might feel more comfortable by including that and being able to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| some of these historic structures instead of just rehab them completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| So I've got a few other points, and I guess I'll maybe save those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| for a potential another case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| But that is the view of our Old Mechanicsville Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6421)|
| 1:47:07| Thank you, Mr. Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| So, Mr. Marlow, please be mindful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| We do have someone signed up in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| So if you could spare some time if you so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| One key thing here I think that needs to be highlighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| I live in the neighborhood and have for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| So I'm not going to recommend anything in my neighborhood that I disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| or believe is bad for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| And moreover, as the staff report notes, I own most of that block face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| and most of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| So I would never do anything to jeopardize and hurt my own values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| So when I bring this to you, I believe this is truly the best option forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| It became apparent, I had no idea, this is not in the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| This is not within the Omni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| In fact, I just thought Chad Weese people, City Public Service, called me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| and wanted 1214 torn down back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| They were tired of giving me time to come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| As you may know, if you've ever worked on condemned properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| they're very difficult to get financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| So it takes a lot to sort of figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| I pulled a demo permit and it was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| Took the demo permit, used it to get hard money lending to start the demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| of the structure and planning and grade work to get ready for a new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| And then it got stopped whenever I started emailing Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| wanting to know how missing middle would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| Apparently, policy was not followed by Peter Aaron's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| so it was never reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| That led to about a 90-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| During that time, I learned that there's a National Historic Register overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| that's on this and that there was a keen interest to save the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| So I went about studying how to possibly save a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| The entire north elevation of this home is underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| The floor structure is full of termites and is pretty compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| I believe I can do it, but I've got to make the numbers work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| And to do that, missing middle would allow me to convert it to a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| within the footprint, which I can do, but the numbers don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| So I need some more square footage and another rental producing unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| And that is I need a carriage house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| What Optico says in their report is a carriage house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| but it's not included in the missing middle housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| We tried twice last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| This planning commission submitted both times to allow accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| It didn't clear counsel, so I can't build one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| The alternative here is the way forward, R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| allow me another principal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| It would have to be a duplex because it has to be a missing middle housing type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| So it's going to be a tiny duplex built at the alley with two parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| and built to look like a garage with an apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| but it will actually be two little duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Now there's some conversation about high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| Under missing middle, I'm allowed a quadplex on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| So I'm not asking for any increased density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| I'm asking, literally, I'm asking, help me find a way to save that old house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6604)|
| 1:50:10| And at the same time, we're going to achieve more housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| which is desperately needed in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| Quickly, I want to save one minute, but quickly, looking at the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| I urge you to go back and read the staff report from last year when we dealt with 12-16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6619)|
| 1:50:26| That was recommended to be approved by planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| and everything stated in that report is 100% applicable, 100% applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| In fact, I find that things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| Like now we've got a stadium a mile away that's up out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| We have Encore Golf half a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| We have infill new developments that I'm not building that other developers are building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| There's been 13 townhomes break ground on West 4th, a block and a half away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| Two new single family homes built less than a block north of here on 5th and Calloway, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6651)|
| 1:51:01| So there's a lot changing, and I think all of it supports rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| This, for the purposes of allowing me to find a financial way to save the old house and increase density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| I'm allowed four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| Let me have the way to do the four units that preserves the old house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| and I'm going to reserve the rest of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| Thank you, Mr. Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Mr. Bartholomew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| Parker Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| I have three seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| Is that what I got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| A minute, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| A minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| I'm looking at that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| I won't take a minute, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Parker Bartholomew, 5406 Summit Ridge Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| Mr. Marlow could build a fourplex currently, not just two units on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| So currently, as it's zoned right now using missing middle, Mr. Schell, so is correct, it's 40 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6707)|
| 1:51:55| I think that sounds pretty awesome, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| I think that's exactly what missing middle was designed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| It was designed to use an existing neighborhood with sidewalks, with all your infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6720)|
| 1:52:07| not increasing stormwater runoff, and put as many units as we can here and making them affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6727)|
| 1:52:16| What he's trying to do is to save that structure and save that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| The fourplex would be very much out of character with this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| And, again, he can do that without any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| Two duplexes here that fit into the neighborhood is a much better fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| He's going to save existing trees that are there and I think everything else he talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| So I'll let you guys have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| I'm going to have those last five seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| The lady that lives at 1212 commented publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| She's in favor of this, and so did a homeowner further down on Callaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| So two homeowners on the block face are in favor of this, and I think that should be given a great deal of weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| Let's go to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Yeah, I remember when this came before our commission in 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6792)|
| 1:53:17| and I think I'm pretty sure I voted against it, concerned that it was in the middle of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6797)|
| 1:53:23| It wasn't on a corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| I felt like it was inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| At the time, I see this lot and I find that it's even, to me, I feel like it's even more inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| It's inconsistent, even at its current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| and now we're going to be increasing the RN4 footprint in the middle of a block to include one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6815)|
| 1:53:42| possibly two other additional lots, which are not compatible for the current zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| I support staff in this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| We are not in a position to try to make development work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| I know Mr. Marlowe is a very smart man, and I'm sure when he purchased this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| there was more than one way that he could make this property work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| $28,000 seems very reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| and I guess I would like to make a motion to deny the applicant's request for RN4 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6849)|
| 1:54:17| because the property does not meet the intent of the RN4 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| All right, we have a motion to deny per staff recommendation by Commissioner Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| And, Commissioner Adams, you had your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| I did, because one thing that troubled me with what Mr. Marlowe was saying was the timing of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6872)|
| 1:54:40| You were painting the timeline, and to hear that a demo permit was pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6880)|
| 1:54:49| the desire to save the structure, but there's already been a demo permit pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| it was going to be removed, and then a complaint that it was stalled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| which I think is the system that's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| It shouldn't be demoed if it's a historic structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| And then to say that you discovered that it was in a historic district, not an overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6904)|
| 1:55:11| but a district seems disingenuous because you live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| How could this just be a discovery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| I just want to say that because it seems odd, and I'm not trying to attack you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| but the painting out of that timeline, it really did kind of stand up as odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| It wasn't just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| It was Peter Aaron's department that also didn't realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| The overlay in question, I always look at the zoning map in KGIS, which shows overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6929)|
| 1:55:35| It does not show this National Park thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| You have to go to some other map, so it's not in the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| How would I know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| And apparently Peter Aaron's department, when they issued the demo permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| didn't catch it, didn't realize it, didn't know it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| because the ordinance would have required them to send it over to Miss Crockett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| for evaluation before issuing the demo permit, which did not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| So it sounds weird, but I'm telling you, that's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| And the only other thing I'd say about the RN-4 on small lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| you could go over to Dameron, just slightly to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| There's a whole lot of tinier lots, about two-thirds the size of this zoned RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| And the corner of Harvey and Emerald has a bunch of small lots that are RN-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| surrounded for many blocks in all directions by RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| So I think it's very, very precedented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| We need to go east, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| Yeah, keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| Keep going, just a little bit more east to Dameron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| On the other side of the interstate, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| Many, many, many, very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| Approximately two-thirds the size of my RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| And to find small RN-4 completely surrounded by RN-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| you could go to the intersection of Harvey and East Emerald, a little farther to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7007)|
| 1:56:59| There's a whole lot of RN-4 there, but I think you're in 4th and Gill now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| If we kind of move over towards Old North Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7022)|
| 1:57:10| I'm just going to say, we're talking about a specific property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| and not all the different ones that are around the map in different contexts entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7034)|
| 1:57:20| So I appreciate your knowledge of where some of these other examples are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| but they're not the property that we're talking about, nor are they in the same context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| Directly behind this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| Thank you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| I'm going to move on to Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| Just to get some clarification from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| It was mentioned that a quadplex could be built on this as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| I know that RN-2 allows for quadplexes, but there's a minimum width standard under missing metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7064)|
| 1:57:52| So I wanted to see if there's a variance, or I don't see how it would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7072)|
| 1:58:00| It may not necessarily be too consequential to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| Just that kind of threw me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| We have not received any formal application for a quadplex for this particular piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| under the metal housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| That's what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| So we haven't evaluated it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| I'd have to take a closer look at it, but there's been no formal application for that housing type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| The quadplexes do have a minimum lot width with an alley of 45 feet, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7101)|
| 1:58:30| This is a nonconforming lot of record, so lot width and area don't have to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7110)|
| 1:58:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| That's mainly what I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| So we do have a motion and a second on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| So the motion is to deny the RN-4 district because the property does not meet the intent of the RN-4 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7134)|
| 1:59:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| Call the roll, Mr. D'Armand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| Commissioner Levinson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| Commissioner Barger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| Commissioner Overton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| We're voting to yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| This is for the deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| Yes would be deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| I think you might need to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| Let's restart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| This is to deny the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| Let's be clear here, a yes is to deny the applicant's request, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| A yes is to denounce the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| This is to deny the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| We're not going to call a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7193)|
| 2:00:00| We're just going to pass it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| What do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| deny the applicant's request. A yes is to deny the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7209)|
| 2:00:16| Correct. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| Commissioner Huber? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7219)|

| 2:02:28| Thank you. I'm hearing whispers of a bathroom break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7348)|
| 2:02:36| so let's take ten minutes. Okay, let's get rolling again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7356)|
| 2:02:45| We are on to item 13. Applicant, Bentley Martlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7365)|
| 2:02:53| I am. All right, do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7373)|
| 2:03:19| We do have opposition. This feels like a rerun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| I'll defer. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7402)|
| 2:03:29| Nathaniel Shelso, 237 Dederick Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| Our neighborhood organization opposes the rezone for the same reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| We want to stop the currently growing RN4 mass in the middle of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7416)|
| 2:03:43| I really fail to understand, and this is one reason I didn't necessarily want to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7423)|
| 2:03:50| on on the Planning Commission, so many of the county picks kind of forcing some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7430)|
| 2:03:57| things that in the inner city area, like the city people understand and say, okay, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| doesn't fit, but the county says shove it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| I don't know. That's kind of interesting to me on the dynamic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| of this commission, but some other things, and this is now me speaking personally, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7448)|
| 2:04:16| about the middle housing code. So to Commissioner Higgins' point, our group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7456)|
| 2:04:24| was confused on basically how you could potentially do a quad on a small lot with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7464)|
| 2:04:37| So like the duplex on RN2 even has a minimum lot width, so I guess we are confused and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7477)|
| 2:04:44| concerned if a nonconforming lot by right has access to everything that's within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| middle housing code that seems problematic, and I guess this is just more of a warning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| that I think that's going to have some backlash longer term throughout the entire TDR area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7496)|
| 2:05:05| So additionally, the second principle use, anything that's RN4 being able to have a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| principle use, when we were passing middle housing code, none of us were really thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| well, what if you do two duplexes on a lot that's big enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| That wasn't really our intent. We weren't thinking about that, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| also something that should be revisited. So those are just suggestions, but Omni wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7524)|
| 2:05:31| to deny this request. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| Thank you, Mr. Schelso. Mr. Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7536)|
| 2:05:42| May I give two of my minutes to Mr. Bartholomew? Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7542)|
| 2:05:50| Thank you. Some of you were here in Parker, Bartholomew, 5406 Summit Ridge Lane. Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7550)|
| 2:05:58| of y'all were here for missing middle. That went through a lot of review, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7558)|
| 2:06:04| still many, many unknowns. I'm going through a missing middle review right now. One of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7564)|
| 2:06:11| the things that we've found is that these smaller non-conforming lots do give you an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7571)|
| 2:06:18| opportunity to provide density. What's strange about that, or maybe favorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| about that, is that many of these lots, when they were originally developed, were developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| for exactly that reason, to create density and not count lot coverage and lot area. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7588)|
| 2:06:37| that's now what we're able to do. So after 50 years of single-family residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| with large lot areas, now we have the missing middle plan that brings us back to what these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| things were originally designed for. That's why, when you go through the TDR, you find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| so many small, non-conforming lots. One of the other things is single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7613)|
| 2:07:02| residential is not allowed in missing middle. I think that would shock most of you to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| that. You cannot put a single-family house in missing middle, because that use is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7626)|
| 2:07:12| there. So if you wanted to do missing middle on that lot, you could not keep that single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7632)|
| 2:07:19| house there. So I will agree, there's a lot of things with missing middle that need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7639)|
| 2:07:25| be looked at. But there's also some things here that get us back to the intention of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| what it is. And I think that in this area, this is Mr. Marlow's backyard. He spent a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7649)|
| 2:07:35| ton of time here. He lives here. He's one of the few developers that actually lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| where they're trying to develop. I don't think he's going to try to hurt this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| Yeah, so it's pretty much more of the same. I'm trying to put density back where density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| used to be. You can look at the Sanborn maps, and you can see that Mechanicsville used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7673)|
| 2:07:59| have an incredibly high density. Most of it's been erased. And I'm trying to put it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7679)|
| 2:08:05| because we need housing, and this is allowed in the TDR. I'm allowed under the missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| middle, a quadplex, two and a half stories high. I don't want to drastically change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| block face or destroy the historic appearance, so I'm trying to save these older homes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| front and build additional housing units back at the alley. And I think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7700)|
| 2:08:27| And just to, since Omni wanted to weigh in, just to remind everyone, this is outside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| overlay, the historic overlay of Mechanicsville, so the guidelines that Omni created does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| apply. But if I were in Omni, the Omni guidelines allow for secondary structure to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| behind the primary structure, provided that it's not visible from the street. So I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| be allowed to build with the Hardy board, with the materials that I proposed to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| on the tiny duplex back by the alley, even if I were subject to the guidelines of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7734)|
| 2:08:59| Omni organization. I've built several up in the Omni area using Hardy that went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7739)|
| 2:09:05| historic zoning for appropriateness and was approved under their guidelines. So even if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| I were to be held to their standards, the small duplex garage carriage house type structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7750)|
| 2:09:18| I'm proposing at the rear is entirely compatible, even with their strict guidelines. So I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| this is entirely appropriate. And for the concerns that there's not RN4 anywhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| except for my property, if you look there, parcel 31, that has a duplex and a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7771)|
| 2:09:36| family on that parcel, yet it's zoned RN2. I believe that's a non-conformity. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| that should actually be RN4, but for some reason it's not. And there's numerous cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| like that all throughout the neighborhood. So as the staff report correctly notes, mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7786)|
| 2:09:52| housing types are already all throughout Mechanicsville, just some of them don't have the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| color on that map. And again, I've been here for 20 years in this neighborhood. I've redeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7796)|
| 2:10:03| most of the neighborhood. But for a lot of my efforts, most of these houses would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| probably been destroyed by either homeless fires or the city tearing them down. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| have done the best I can. Maybe Mr. Schultz calls it demolition by neglect. I've kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| them standing, and I think I have a path forward for them. And that is a lot more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| than some people realize. So I urge you to help me out here and support this. And maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7825)|
| 2:10:33| when I get done, we'll have a ribbon cutting, and you can come see exactly the powers of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| missing metal to increase density and still look historically accurate and function very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7837)|
| 2:10:42| well in our city. And by doing so, we can take a lot of the stress off the county, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| maybe we'll be able to preserve some farmland in the process. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| Thank you, Mr. Marlowe. Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| I have a question for staff. Since a lot of the argument to do this is in the name of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7853)|
| 2:11:04| preservation of the existing house on site, is it possible for us to make a motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7864)|
| 2:11:12| includes adding historic overlay on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7872)|
| 2:11:21| You cannot condition the zoning, but I guess technically you could. Typically those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7881)|
| 2:11:40| originate within the Historic Zoning Commission. You could ask for consideration. This body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| could send it over to the Historic Zoning Commission and ask them to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| I think that would be more steps than I'm looking for here, but I think that it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7910)|
| 2:12:03| like the main argument for changing the zoning here is so that the front units can be preserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7923)|
| 2:12:20| and that historic preservation, well, if it has a historic overlay and goes to the Historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| Zoning Commission, then those guidelines will be followed and enforced, and the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7946)|
| 2:12:32| from the neighborhood of just tearing down and just using the same footprint would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7952)|
| 2:12:40| I think, partially, if not completely, alleviated. I know that in an ideal situation, most situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7960)|
| 2:12:48| we would recommend consideration for that, but if I make a motion to approve the RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7968)|
| 2:12:56| with an also historic designation, can we approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7976)|
| 2:13:06| I'm reading the creation of an H overlay district. It says the city council, the mayor, or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7986)|
| 2:13:14| owner of the subject property has the authority to initiate applications, and then it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| go to the Historic Zoning Commission. Perhaps at the city council stage of the review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| but it doesn't seem that that power is granted to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| Is that for a full district or just a... Because I know that there's two different designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8008)|
| 2:13:34| There's the historic district, and then there's historic site overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8014)|
| 2:13:42| This is for the historic district overlay, which can be applied to a single property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8022)|
| 2:13:49| Well then, I would... Commissioner Higgins, you could make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8029)|
| 2:13:56| You can't condition it, but you could make it part of the record that council consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| such an overlay. I would. I won't make a motion, but I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8041)|
| 2:14:08| make a recommendation for this case and the previous case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| The city council do consider the historic overlay on these two sites, given that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8051)|
| 2:14:20| purpose for this is historic preservation, and that it is currently in a historic designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8060)|
| 2:14:27| area through the National Park Service. So even though it's not already in a historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8067)|
| 2:14:37| district, it is under the pre-1865 map in the Mechanicsville Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8077)|
| 2:14:47| So I would want to say on record that if city council is out there listening that when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8087)|
| 2:14:55| gets to them, that I hope they will consider that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| Thank you. Vice Chair Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| I guess I just want to throw one thing out to former Commissioner Heschel. I was disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8105)|
| 2:15:12| to hear that you feel there's a difference between the city and the county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| up here. I do feel like we try to work as a cohesive group. That's the purpose of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8116)|
| 2:15:22| It's a design. There's a balance between the city and the county. The city looks at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| The county looks at it. We look at stuff in the city. They look at stuff in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| But there are different zones, and I think we're all appointed for our opinions. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8132)|
| 2:15:39| and I voted together quite often, and occasionally not, but I was a little disappointed to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| that your personal feelings were such that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| So here, with respect to this, I do think it's in a traditional neighborhood development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8148)|
| 2:15:53| area. You're 300 or 400 feet away from a nice commercial node at University and 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8153)|
| 2:16:02| It is more of the missing middle, the infill of the housing in that area. So again, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8162)|
| 2:16:09| like the last one, I'd like to make a motion to approve RN4 because it is an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8169)|
| 2:16:15| of the zone next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Okay, we have a motion to approve RN4 zoning by Vice Chair Hubert, seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8180)|
| 2:16:29| Browning, and we have much discussion left. So let's go to Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8189)|
| 2:16:35| Thank you, Chairman. I just wanted to say a few words. Obviously, I think I know where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| this vote is going, which is fine, so I won't belabor any points here, but I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| say a few words. I know that missing middle is a very important issue. It's one that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8203)|
| 2:16:48| around my dinner table for many months prior to, I'm thinking, a lot of people found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| that this was the intent. So I can speak fairly authoritatively about what the intent was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| behind at least some of the initial conversations in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| And I'd also like to point out that, you know, Mr. Marlowe, you are a very clear, upstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8221)|
| 2:17:06| part of your community, and I commend you with a lot of the great work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| In regards to the mis-limiting, your name came up very often in support of that. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8229)|
| 2:17:14| nothing but respect for you, which is why it pains me a little bit to be a bit on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| other side of this issue. I think that the intent of that missing middle was to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| other avenues other than having to rezone everything in order to provide the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| that we need. We've heard multiple times here that you could, by right, put a fourplex on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8246)|
| 2:17:31| this without having to go through this process, and I think that was the intent of missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| middle was to give people like you the opportunity to be able to do what you need to do in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8255)|
| 2:17:40| to provide housing for our city residents, particularly in the area that you work in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| which is incredibly well needed, and I commend you for all the work that you've done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| I am personally just a little concerned, as we're setting precedent, to continue to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| a tool as a sledgehammer to just rezone things when it's more convenient to do so in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8273)|
| 2:17:59| then to use the missing middle that you have already gone down the path of to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| accomplish the same thing. I understand that the intent is to try to help save the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| but from a purely objective perspective, we want those units to come up to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8287)|
| 2:18:13| provide that. Saving the house is commendable, but as you have pointed out a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8293)|
| 2:18:18| you're not in that historic overlay district, and with respect to what the Omni believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| or not, you aren't bound by their guidelines in that regard. I don't see why you couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8302)|
| 2:18:28| just get the density that you require to be able to make that site work within the bounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| that are already before you. That being said, it's pretty clear that where the vote is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8313)|
| 2:18:38| so I look forward to the ribbon cutting, but I'm still not going to be able to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8318)|
| 2:18:43| a rezoning just for the sake of precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8323)|
| 2:18:47| Thank you, Commissioner Gill. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| Yeah, I think related to Commissioner Gill's comment, I just want to make sure I'm clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| on the bounds of what is currently enabled with the current zoning, and my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8333)|
| 2:18:59| is that you can't build an ADU in the back on this property because the primary residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8339)|
| 2:19:05| is a duplex and not a single family. Is that correct? Mike, sorry if I butchered our conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8345)|
| 2:19:11| on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| That's my understanding. That's the ADU regulations on the base zoning only allow accessory dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8353)|
| 2:19:18| units in association with a single family house, but no other housing type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| Okay, and I guess that's where I'm struggling is because an ADU feels like the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| way to add density to this lot, but the current missing middle guidelines don't enable a mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8368)|
| 2:19:36| for that, and so RN4 feels like the only way to enable increased density on this lot without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8376)|
| 2:19:44| demolishing the house and then building a quadplex up front, so I think that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| I'm torn. I plan on supporting the vote again, but if anybody has other ideas of how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8388)|
| 2:19:54| can increase density, you know, with missing middle or without demolishing the lot or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| the house, I'd be open to hearing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. Commissioner Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| Thank you. Yeah, I just wanted to first echo Commissioner Huber's sentiment that we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| work together, and I know I particularly have the tendency sometimes to get a little hot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8411)|
| 2:20:16| up here, but all that to say, like, I think we all respect each other's opinions, at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8416)|
| 2:20:22| I hope I do. I know I certainly, for example, respect Commissioner Adams' opinion, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8422)|
| 2:20:26| though we rarely vote together, but I think, you know, she provides great input, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| would echo that with everybody up here, and I think that we all genuinely care about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| community, about the county and the city, and just as background, you know, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| know if you know this, Commissioner Schultz, though, and I know that you also had incredible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| intentions when you were on this body. You know, I've lived downtown for almost ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| and I don't intend to move out of the city limits, really out of, like, the very close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| city limits, probably ever, because the burbs probably aren't for me, but all that to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8454)|
| 2:20:59| even though I'm a county appointee, I care very deeply about the city and walkable communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8459)|
| 2:21:05| and all that, and I'm sure that all my fellow county appointees think that, too, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| I would echo what Commissioner Biggs just said about I genuinely believe that this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| Mechanicsville, is a good neighborhood for more increased density. I think R and 4, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8476)|
| 2:21:24| know, provides a lot of housing types that are completely appropriate in Mechanicsville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| and that really seek to benefit our community, particularly, as Mr. Marlow has pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| during the housing crisis, which you guys will just going to have to get tired of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| saying that, and so I just wanted to provide that background on why I support it and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| echo what Commissioner Huber said, because I think there doesn't need to be such a divide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| between us, even though we may disagree. Thank you, Commissioner Overton. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8507)|
| 2:21:52| Browning. Thank you, Chairman Hill. Gosh, I think what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| bothers me the most about this deal is I really respect former Commissioner Schelso, but gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8515)|
| 2:22:02| we've got three really smart guys here, Schelso, Marlow, and Bartholomew. You can tell they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8522)|
| 2:22:08| all really smart and they care about that neighborhood. It's just interesting how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8528)|
| 2:22:15| can't come together, but I wish they could all kind of get to some common ground, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| have a beer and, you know, see the great development of Mechanicsville. Having said that, I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8540)|
| 2:22:28| feel like the R and 4 gives Mr. Marlow the flexibility to be able to do what he needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8548)|
| 2:22:34| to do there, and that's why I'm in support of it. All right, let's see here. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8554)|
| 2:22:44| Thanks. This is a question for staff that goes into just making sure I'm thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8564)|
| 2:22:53| things correctly. Were the applicant to live in this property, the ADU would not be a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8573)|
| 2:23:04| right? Part of this has to do with ownership and the property itself and thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8584)|
| 2:23:15| it in terms of missing middle. Can you restate the question? If the applicant lived on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8595)|
| 2:23:23| subject property? Well, I'm reflecting on missing middle, because one of my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8603)|
| 2:23:29| and why I voted as I did on the previous case, and I think Commissioner Gill's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8609)|
| 2:23:35| the numbers right how this one will go, but the precedent that's being set to just use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8615)|
| 2:23:43| rezoning as a way to do this as opposed to work with that plan, no one's against ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8623)|
| 2:23:53| but it's the way that those ADUs are built and then executed is the issue. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8633)|
| 2:24:03| we're covering ADUs with this rezoning. The question about ADUs was whether it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8643)|
| 2:24:09| considered on a property that's not a single family, but under middle housing, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8649)|
| 2:24:20| a nonconforming lot of records, so lot width and area doesn't count against it in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| of what could be permitted. Middle housing permits a variety of more intensive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8664)|
| 2:24:31| forms, and under its RN2, yeah, under RN4, I think, you know, it allows for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8671)|
| 2:24:45| principal use, which would allow for a second duplex in this particular example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8685)|
| 2:24:55| Yeah. Okay. Any other? Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8695)|
| 2:25:04| We've got a lot more on the agenda, a long way to go, so I'll be brief. I think the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8704)|
| 2:25:11| thing that stands out to me with this is, and not even specific to this, but it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8711)|
| 2:25:19| like the purpose for this request is due to the fact that RN2 does not allow more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8719)|
| 2:25:26| one principal use structure on the site, and, you know, I think that this, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8726)|
| 2:25:36| it would be appropriate for staff, I would like for staff to look at maybe whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8736)|
| 2:25:43| not it's appropriate to have that restriction in our code, because I've seen a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8743)|
| 2:25:48| instances with RN1 and RN2 where it does seem like more than one principal use would make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| sense. There's, you know, used to, we, it was much more common to parcel off for every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8755)|
| 2:26:02| single unit, and we've got a agenda item that is specifically related to rezoning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8762)|
| 2:26:10| flag lots and how that has often historically been done, but, you know, a lot of times it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8770)|
| 2:26:19| more common now to see condo association type subdivisions where you, you know, with a townhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8779)|
| 2:26:26| you may have multiple townhouses that are not each individually parceled off, they're a HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8786)|
| 2:26:33| ownership structure. So, you know, I think that it might be worth looking into the limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8793)|
| 2:26:41| on number of principal use structures on a site, and not just for missing metal, but broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8801)|
| 2:26:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| Thank you, Commissioner Higgins. Looks like we've run out of lights, and I think we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| motion and a second on the floor, and that is to approve RN4 district, because it is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8815)|
| 2:27:05| extension of the district. Okay. Everybody clear on that? All right. So, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8825)|

| 2:27:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8873)|
| 2:28:24| All right. On to agenda item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8904)|
| 2:28:30| This is City of Knoxville zoning ordinance amendments pertaining to flag lots and multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8910)|
| 2:28:37| lots without street frontage utilizing access easements. Staff recommendation is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8917)|
| 2:28:49| approval of amendments as opposed as proposed as proposed to the City of Knoxville zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8929)|

| 2:29:25| in multiple lots without street frontage utilized and access easement. Everybody got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8965)|
| 2:29:35| Good. All right. Let's see. Who's going to speak on that? Michelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8975)|
| 2:29:40| Miss Portier, you going to speak on that? Would you like to comment? No? Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8980)|
| 2:29:46| Any opposition? Okay. We do have opposition. Miss Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=8986)|
| 2:30:05| Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee. I'm not here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| I sent a comment asking for a 30-day postponement. You can tell by what Mr. Hill read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9011)|
| 2:30:21| this is complex. You don't just need to look at the zoning ordinance. You also need to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| the subdivision regulations to understand it. You can see by the agenda item or the file number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9026)|
| 2:30:35| this has been around since four, January, February, March, April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9035)|
| 2:30:42| of 24. It's complicated. This showed up on the public website for the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9042)|
| 2:30:50| on Friday, last week. That's not enough time for public notice. That's not enough time for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| public to understand what this is. If you want meaningful input, you can't put something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| this up. It's 90 pages to look through. You can't put something up on a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9063)|
| 2:31:12| That's when the text went up, on Friday of last week, and hear it on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9072)|
| 2:31:19| Meaningful comment takes more time than that for neighborhoods and individuals to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9079)|
| 2:31:28| I again renew my request that it be postponed. Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9088)|
| 2:31:39| Commissioner Higgins. Thank you. I definitely don't disagree. This does seem complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9099)|
| 2:31:46| In fact, during the agenda review, I was a little confused about the scope of the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9106)|
| 2:31:52| because there are a lot of figures, a lot of code references. At first glance, it can seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9112)|
| 2:32:02| like there's a lot more to it than just the amount of straightforward that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9122)|
| 2:32:12| Michelle, would you care to maybe summarize the bare bones intent of what this is accomplishing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9132)|
| 2:32:22| Sure. This is whenever someone is using an access easement, which is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9142)|
| 2:32:30| permissions to cross over someone's property to access another property. When that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| on multiple lots where there are not street frontage, we are proposing to require that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9156)|
| 2:32:42| those structures face the easement instead of the street. The other thing that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9162)|
| 2:32:49| proposing, this diagram that's up here now, that is referring to the other part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| which is the flag lots. The diagram at the top of that page, that's illustrating where there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9174)|
| 2:32:59| maybe situations and when there are multiple flag lots created, which create multiple access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9179)|
| 2:33:05| along a street, which can create a safety concern. We are proposing to prohibit serial flag lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9185)|
| 2:33:11| because there is an option for an easement instead, which is the second diagram on that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9191)|
| 2:33:17| So it just provides a safer mechanism for people to be able to access their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9197)|
| 2:33:22| You can see from those two diagrams, they have the same amounts of properties that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| subdivided. So it doesn't prohibit someone from being able to subdivide their property. It does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| provide a safer access point. The other part with the flag lots is that we are proposing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9211)|
| 2:33:37| at least 70% of the structure to be sort of shifted over, staggered, so that's not directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| behind the property that's the flag lot that is behind. And then regarding the multiple lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9222)|
| 2:33:51| with the building orientation shifting towards the easement, that also creates that front lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9231)|
| 2:33:57| would be along the easement instead. So there's a lot of language in there to clarify where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9237)|
| 2:34:01| setback would come from, but that's the gist of it. Thank you. And I will strongly advocate not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9241)|
| 2:34:09| just for limiting the number of driveways and trying to consolidate all of that, but also for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9249)|
| 2:34:18| when subdividing land, using an access easement so that the access to that is privately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9258)|
| 2:34:27| managed and owned and not something that's put onto the taxpayers to have to maintain and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9267)|
| 2:34:36| care of. So allowing, and it's a very minor change, just that now when using an access easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9276)|
| 2:34:44| instead of having to face the street, because you could be let's say five houses back and having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9284)|
| 2:34:48| face a street that you can't even see, that now you can actually turn and face that. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9288)|
| 2:34:56| optimistically I hope that this leads to more instances where subdivisions are maintaining their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9296)|
| 2:35:03| main road as an access easement instead of putting it into a public road for taxpayers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9303)|
| 2:35:14| pay for. So with that, I think that it does look complicated. I think there's time before it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9314)|
| 2:35:22| to City Council to discuss it or to discuss it at City Council if there are community concerns. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9322)|
| 2:35:28| been postponed in the past, so I'll make a motion to approve for staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9328)|
| 2:35:35| We've got a motion to approve for staff recommendation by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9335)|
| 2:35:39| seconded by Vice Chair Huber. We have still more lights. Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9339)|
| 2:35:45| Yeah, hi. I just want to thank Ms. Malone for speaking up. You know, it's hard when you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9345)|
| 2:35:52| get feedback from the community on something, and you know, especially in the City, I see this as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9352)|
| 2:35:57| being something that could open up more development in deep properties. I know there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9357)|
| 2:36:05| piece of property in my neighborhood, actually, that this could affect potentially 30 houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9365)|
| 2:36:11| that surround that piece of property if they were to allow their access easement into developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| this deep part of the property. I actually would like for a postponement to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9377)|
| 2:36:25| just kind of reach out to the community, give it more time, get the word out, and address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9385)|
| 2:36:31| maybe in 30, 60 days. Were you going to say something? Yeah, one of the things, the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9391)|
| 2:36:37| is not the intent of this. Nobody wants five flag light access, flag lot access in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9397)|
| 2:36:50| The problem is if you look at the detail, the front yard setback of these houses facing each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9410)|
| 2:36:58| other will be 10 feet from the easement, 25-foot easement, 10-foot setback. So you'll have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9418)|
| 2:37:07| facade, the front yard setback, the facade of two buildings 45 feet apart in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9427)|
| 2:37:15| your neighborhood. It will override the dimensional standards in table 4-1 of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9435)|
| 2:37:25| zoning ordinance for the EN zone, RN1, and so on. This is not a simple, we don't want five flag lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9445)|
| 2:37:36| This is far more complicated. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Mello. So I know there's a motion on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9456)|
| 2:37:46| table. I'll leave it up to Commissioner Higgins, but I guess I will probably be voting no on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9466)|
| 2:37:55| in support of a postponement. Thank you, Commissioner Midas. Commissioner Biggs. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| just going to say I was initially leaning towards postponement, you know, 90 pages is a lot, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9480)|
| 2:38:05| see that the vast majority of that just copy-pasted zoning code without much change. So I definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9485)|
| 2:38:11| appreciate the comment that this is a complicated issue and a lot to process, but I guess I do feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9491)|
| 2:38:17| like that maybe that 90-page total is a little bit misleading of how much is actually proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9497)|
| 2:38:21| to change. So I think I'm comfortable voting yes, and if there's further discussion that can be had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9501)|
| 2:38:26| at the city, county level. Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. Commissioner Anderson. This is actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9506)|
| 2:38:32| Michelle, a question for you. Was any discussion taking place around maybe standardizing the type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9512)|
| 2:38:42| of maintenance agreement that would be kind of put forth when this type of thing is up for review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9522)|
| 2:38:50| So access easements have been around for a long time. We're not proposing to create access easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9530)|
| 2:38:57| We're just proposing that it be used instead of flag lots. So it's just included in the diagrams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9537)|
| 2:39:02| to illustrate the difference between that. So essentially what happens is someone draws up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| the lawyer draws up the easement agreement. It agrees to who maintains the easement, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9547)|
| 2:39:13| paved surface within that easement, and then all the abutting property owners or all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9553)|
| 2:39:19| users of that agreement would sign off on that. So I guess I understand that, and I certainly think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9559)|
| 2:39:27| that in an ideal world it would be great to put these driveways and these access points more as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9567)|
| 2:39:36| something that the actual users maintain. What concerns me a little bit is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9576)|
| 2:39:45| if it's a true joint permanent easement and it's jointly owned or jointly owned by six different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9585)|
| 2:39:55| homeowners, it's pretty clear about what the maintenance obligations are. This is a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9595)|
| 2:40:01| different in terms of having the driveway be used by, say, four homeowners or five homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9601)|
| 2:40:09| but it's really on one person's lot. And as someone that closes real estate transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9609)|
| 2:40:17| for a living, I can see a ton of confusion amongst buyers down the line, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9617)|
| 2:40:24| of not really understanding what they're getting, and sometimes we have a tendency to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9624)|
| 2:40:32| put together maybe less than perfect easement agreements. And I would just put it out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9632)|
| 2:40:40| that I think that it would be problematic down the line to not pay attention or have some oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9640)|
| 2:40:47| in making sure that the maintenance agreements that go along with these are somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9647)|
| 2:40:53| comprehensive. And I would disagree with that. Right now the current practice is for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9653)|
| 2:40:58| easements to be submitted to the law department, and we require the law department approval before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9658)|
| 2:41:04| we can sign off on the plat. Because that's not our area of expertise, we don't examine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9664)|
| 2:41:10| legal documents and have that background, so we do get assistance from the law department in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9670)|
| 2:41:17| Last chair, Huber. Yeah, thank you. And again, thank you, Ms. Malone, where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9677)|
| 2:41:25| ended up, I don't know. But yeah, always public input is good. I would probably lean towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9685)|
| 2:41:33| Commissioner Biggs. To me, as I've read it, it's really not a substantial change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9693)|
| 2:41:40| substantive change. I really, because I've dealt with this in the city zoning before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9700)|
| 2:41:45| and it is very, very cumbersome the way it's written right now. And I think it was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9705)|
| 2:41:49| an unintended consequence. They were trying to do the right thing with the zoning and the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9709)|
| 2:41:56| the easements worked, but it was really causing a lot of good, unlikely scenarios when people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9716)|
| 2:42:06| tried to use them. So I see it more of a correction of an error that's inside the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9726)|
| 2:42:14| I'm in full support of it. Okay, Commissioner Higgins. I'll just say, I support this. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9734)|
| 2:42:28| see a need to rush it. So if there's a desire to postpone 30 days and have concerns addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9748)|
| 2:42:39| then I think that I don't see an issue with that. If staff, unless staff has any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9759)|
| 2:42:47| thoughts towards that, okay. Then I'll amend my motion to just go ahead and postpone for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9767)|
| 2:42:57| and give more time. Second. All right. Okay, so we're withdrawing the initial motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9777)|
| 2:43:05| Okay, and our second man agreed to that. Okay, so we have a motion to postpone for 30 days by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9785)|
| 2:43:12| Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Vice Chair Huber. Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240808?start=9792)|
