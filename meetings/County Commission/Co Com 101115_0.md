| 0:17:37| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1057)|
| 0:17:54| Before we get to that, if we do have time for public forum, is there anyone who would like to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| If you're going to be speaking on a specific item, we'll give you a chance to do that when we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| But if there's something in general you'd like to address the commission, we'd like to give you that opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| Seeing no one, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| Consideration for resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee, creating a task force to review the composition, structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| function, power, and authority of the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| This is Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Let me also say, if you want to speak on one of these items, please come to the podium and you'll be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| If you did not sign up, but we still want to hear what you have to say if you'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| Commissioner Briggs, I believe we'd asked you last time if you would bring us a recommendation, so I'll turn the floor to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| What I've done in the past week, I've talked with Mr. Rice in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| I've talked to the sheriff and also several other people who have been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| with ethics issues, either with companies or with other large organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| Part of the reason that we want to do this is to define better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| really what the ethics committee should be looking at if there are ethics issues that come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| and also what the composition of the ethics committee should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| Some of them referred me actually to the U.S. Congress' ethics committee that they have that's very active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1161)|
| 0:19:29| and they're actually considering a very controversial one right now with Representative Rangel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| But the subjects that the Congressional Ethics Committee looks at are somewhat similar to what the state legislature gave to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1175)|
| 0:19:46| and some of those involve gifts, conflicts of interest, which we would look at now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| but also travel, campaign activity, outside employment and income, financial disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| and also what in the case particularly of the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| what the staff could do and could not do outside the offices that they hold if they're full-time county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1207)|
| 0:20:16| To me, this is a good outline of the type of things that I think that this task force on the ethics committee should look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1216)|
| 0:20:25| The second part of what I had in mind was trying to depoliticize, so to speak, the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1225)|
| 0:20:35| and that presently the county commission makes appointments, the mayor's office makes appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| the ethics committee makes appointments, and the sheriff's office makes appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| And we can look at whether we want to continue that system or whether we would like to have an all-citizens committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1244)|
| 0:20:53| that would be perhaps more objective and not be necessarily representing interest either of the body that appointed them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| or some other interest within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| In other words, try to look at this from a more objective point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| The task force that I propose would be able to examine these issues, and this, of course, would be in an open forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1267)|
| 0:21:17| And even to have the task force look at it without necessarily representing certain interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1277)|
| 0:21:26| I would propose that we have, as representatives that are presently on the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| is maybe take two of those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| One of those is Bob Thompson, and just for a little background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| he's an attorney that served a good portion of his career involved with ethics issues with the TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| He certainly knows how to look at what a large organization should be concerned about with ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| and really what the function of the ethics committee should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| And then also Karen Smith, who I believe is presently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Tennessee for an advanced doctorate degree in ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1316)|
| 0:22:10| I presently am the county representative on the ethics committee, and I plan to attend every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1330)|
| 0:22:19| but I don't necessarily want to sit on the committee because of the same reasons that I just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| I know that Commissioner Brown and Commissioner Wright both attended the CTAS conference last week that they gave on ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1344)|
| 0:22:37| and I would appreciate if they would be willing to serve on this task force committee also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| since they did have the benefit of attending that conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| and they haven't been involved in the same way that I or other members have of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| I talked to Sheriff Jones today and would ask that he send some representative, whether it's a civilian representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| or by that I mean a citizen representative, or someone to sit on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| and then I talked with Dean Rice from the mayor's office and asked him to do the same thing to look at these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| Part of the concern that we've had and some of the complaints I've had is that the ethics committee is perhaps trying to act like an inspector general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| or the TBI or something out of the prosecutor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| If that's what we want to do, I think that would be fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| but I also think we need to examine very closely what's done both at the national level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| at other counties, at the state level, and in large businesses with their ethics surveillance committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1414)|
| 0:23:42| and try to model it after that so we're not going beyond what the scope of operations are really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1422)|
| 0:23:53| with what the state had in mind when this was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| So your recommendation is that there be a six-member panel, two from the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| I believe you mentioned Mr. Thompson and Ms. Smith, two commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| and you said those commissioners were Commissioner Wright and who was the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| And Commissioner Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| And Commissioner Brown, and then a representative of the sheriff's office, a representative of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| Is that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| That's the form of a motion I'd like to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Ms. Davis, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Lane Davis, 913 Station View Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| As current chair of the ethics committee, I believe it would be appropriate that I serve on this task force as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| Well, I think that I've received letters from citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| You know, I would say that myself as a commission member and a member of the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| probably now because of the people rotating off, I've been on as long as anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| I really think that I plan to attend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| I would encourage you to attend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| I would rather have people with much more experience than either one of us have be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| We can still put our inputs there where there are citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| but I think to have citizen members and to try to have commission members that aren't involved in the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| allows us to form it better from an outside perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1519)|
| 0:25:27| and that's the reason I've particularly recused myself from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| Commissioner, if I could just, the interpreter is having a difficult time hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| so if we could get you to speak right into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| You almost have to kiss these microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| Unaccustomed as I am to microphones, but nonetheless, if you would speak right into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| I understand, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I understand your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| However, at the same time, I think it is important to have someone sit on that panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| who has been a part of the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| and understands some of the legislative intent of the things that we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| and can answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| I understand that you're saying that I could attend all of the meetings as a person in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| However, I think it's important for the ethics committee to have a voice on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| of someone who has been a part of some of these processes, procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| and have a voting standpoint and perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| I think that that's an important aspect that needs to be included in your panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| Really, with this task force, there will not be the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| as a creation of the county commission, and we are not required to even have an ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| We've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| That is a creation of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| so the only people that will be voting on it are the 11 members that are sitting here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| The recommendations that come back to the county commission will be those of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| and those of any citizens or other people that wish to have input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| Really, all the task force is is just to sort of guide the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| I've had citizens that have wanted to be on this also, and they are welcome to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| They're welcome to have input when the county commission is prepared to vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| because that will be the ultimate vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| People are welcome to come to the podium and present their views to the county commission also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| but I think to have the actual public forums on this would be best to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| There are already two members of the ethics committee on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| To have three would be, I think, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Yes, sir, but Mr. Thompson hasn't even attended a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| nor I don't know that he's had any ethics training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Has Mr. Jarrett given him his ethics training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| I understand that, sir, but as part of sitting on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| you still have to go through the required training that Mr. Jarrett, the law director's office, provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| He has not been afforded that opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| I agree that obviously he is an expert outside of what you're speaking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| but I think that as a requirement of the committee itself, that should be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| and I think he should be afforded the opportunity, just like the other new members that will be appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| to go through that training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| And I would like to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| I think it would be an important aspect to have someone with experience sitting on that task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| because this will directly affect whether or not we have a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and the direction of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Well, you know, I think what part of the problem is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| is that we really want to get people that have not been involved in it involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| That's why I specifically, I've been on the Ethics Committee longer than you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| and I specifically excluded myself from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| But, sir, if you get people involved that haven't been involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| they don't understand what we have done and what we haven't done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| unless they go back and review all of the meetings, go back, listen to all of the clerk's records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| I'll tell you what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| It's not for me to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| I've made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| If other members of this committee would like to vote on it, we'll vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| Yes, Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Yeah, I think it's important that we understand that when you talk about legislative intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| and direction of the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| the law director's office will be sitting in on the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| and they'll be providing legal counsel, and they'll be providing direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| I agree with Dr. Briggs that it should be somebody that's apart from what's been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| from the day of its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| I think it needs to be totally reevaluated by an outside group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| to see if it's in the past overstepped its bounds and then give it guidelines for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| And I think that's what the intent of this legislation is for the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| The class that I attended was accredited, four-hour class, certified, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1789)|
| 0:29:59| And it had a test at the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Commissioner Brown and I attended independently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| and at least I didn't know he was going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| He might have read my mind and knew I would have been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| but we did this independent of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| My concern with being there was to find out what the legislative intent was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| and how the state legislature intended the various counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| to do what we'll consider to be in this ethics bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1830)|
| 0:30:39| With all of that having been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| this committee that Dr. Briggs is bringing before us or asking that we appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| will strictly be doing, I anticipate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| collect a recommendation to deliver to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| about how the ethics policy of next county should be administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| And I will support his motion as made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| Any other comments from any commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| Page 7, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| regarding Carter Elementary School, Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| As we begin our discussion on this, I'd like to call on a couple of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Ms. Kincannon, would you like to speak now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| or would you rather wait on this item on Carter Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| I know the mayor's office wants to speak as well, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| Mayor, would you like to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| Or Ms. Kincannon, you can speak first, whichever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| Okay, Ms. Kincannon, if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| My name is India Kincannon, chairwoman of the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| I live at 941 Eleanor Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Is this microphone the kind you have to get extra close to or can everybody hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have gotten two messages from people who are watching this on TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| who say they're having a very, very difficult time hearing what anyone is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| So if you really would get right up on your microphone, that will hopefully help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| I wasn't kidding when I said you almost have to kiss these things about this close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| so this way everybody can hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Okay, thank you, Ms. Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| First, I wanted to thank commission and welcome you to Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| This is also the high school in my district, and I want to echo Commissioner Boyle's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| I'm also super proud of the faculty and staff and students of this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| There's really been a transformation here, a total change and positive way of the school culture with amazing results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1976)|
| 0:33:07| 30 percentage points better in graduation rate than just two, three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| and I think the students are very much engaged and believe that they can and should graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1991)|
| 0:33:19| and have the support in this building to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| So I applaud the faculty and staff and appreciate your willingness to be here and learn about that firsthand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| so thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Also, just before I get to the point at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| I wanted to mention that I just came from the Tennessee School Board Association Convention in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| and that's always a good learning experience, and I wanted to say that I'm glad to be in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| We have our difficulties with our challenges, and sometimes we have difficulties in our interactions with commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| but in talking to my colleagues across the state, I feel very fortunate that our county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| you all are very supportive of education and do your best to find the funds for our children and our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| and our faculty and staff, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| Now, the reason I'm here today is on behalf of the Knox County Board of Education to respectfully request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| that the Knox County Commission fully fund our capital improvement plan for FY2011 and 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| by appropriating an additional $5 million for capital improvements for this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| I have five points that I want to make, and some of these are repeats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| because I've been before you several times since last June or July on this one particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| but I'll make these five points and then be available to answer any questions as you discuss the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| The first is, the Board of Education wants to fix Carter Elementary, the sooner the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| Carter Elementary School has serious deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Renovation will fix them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Knox County Schools has a stellar track record of renovating buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| The building we're in right now is one great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| It's an amazing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| At one time, it was threatened to be shut down, but instead we've renovated it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| and now it's, again, a stellar school that kids are getting a great education in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| We applaud Carter Elementary School's academic achievements and commend their persistent advocacy efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| We'd like to give them what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| It's not fun saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| We are elected officials and face the same pressures that you all do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| but we can't in good conscience support spending $10 million additional dollars for a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| when we are confident that a renovation will be a high-quality, long-term transformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| that the community will be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| The second point I want to make is that this is the Board of Education's capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| It's not Jim McIntyre's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| It's not county commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| It's the Board of Education's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| You all appropriate the money, and we decide how to allocate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| We are an elected body authorized to govern the school system per county charter and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| It's a big job, and we work hard at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| We study, scrutinize, ask questions, demand accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| We welcome and expect commission to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| and I think we've gone to great lengths to demonstrate that we have done our due diligence on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| We do not need two bodies to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| That's redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| We are not staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| We are elected by the people of Knox County to govern schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| I'd like to just allude to some comments made by commissioners on the August 23rd meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| Commissioner Briggs said, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| the school board has looked at this and has said repair, not replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| It's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| It's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| It's the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Commissioner McKenzie said, let's get back in our lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| We're playing in your old sandbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| The third point I want to make is that the Board of Education is fiscally conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| Renovation is the best way to fix Carter over the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Taking care of our facilities is good stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and discarding old buildings is wasteful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| We've built beyond our means for years, and now debt service is eating into our operating budget up to 2% this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| This comes to a total of $7.3 million that would otherwise be used for instruction, and that's just this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2215)|
| 0:37:03| And debt is debt, no matter whether it's taken on by the Board of Education or commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| We all get money from the same source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| The fourth point I want to make is that the Board of Education wants productive relationship with county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| I believe that we've been very respectful to your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| You asked us to consider less expensive building techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| We examined them, and we decided that the less expensive techniques were not the best value for the taxpayer in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| You said, wait and let new board members express their views on this issue, and then we'll honor the board's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| We waited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| We voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| We got the same result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| That is the will of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| It's reflected in the elected board's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| And I'll quote Commissioner Anders' comments from the August 23rd meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| He said, I don't want to tell the school board what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| You all know education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| I don't know education as well as I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| If it bounces back to us next month with the same recommendation that you all have, I'm voting to renovate Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2270)|
| 0:37:59| The fifth and final point I'd like to make is one that Commissioner Wright has often made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| This is about Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| Carter deserves attention now, and I'd like to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| We'd like to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| We're not obliged to fulfill disingenuous promises made by former Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| He should not have made promises he couldn't keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| I really regret that he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| I was present when he did, and I think that was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| Building a new building when a renovation is a perfectly reasonable solution sets a horrible precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| Will you attempt to circumvent the board every time a community prefers new construction to renovation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| Will you find new money for every other community that wants a new school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Will you find new money for teacher salaries and positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| Why would you give us $10 million that we haven't asked for and have said we don't need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| People have asked me numerous times, just ask the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| They want to give you the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| And I know for those of you who have been on here for several years, which is most of you, we've never hesitated to ask for money when we say we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| And I know we'll be back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| But we do ask for money when we say we need it, and you guys have most often been very responsive to those requests, and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| This issue has been studied, voted on, studied some more, and voted on again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| Commissioner Mike Hammond said on August 23rd, quote, I'm not for prolonging this another three, six, or eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| I'm ready to go ahead and have some kind of decision here within the next 30 days or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| This is not a Republican or Democratic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| It's about doing the right thing for Cargill Elementary and living within our means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| I'm asking again on behalf of the Board of Education to please vote to appropriate $5 million to the Board of Education today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| Mayor Burchett, would you like to address us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| Tim Burchett, Knox County Mayor, 6401 Ayrtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| First of all, we're not asking you at this point to appropriate $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2400)|
| 0:40:08| I'm not sure where that figure's come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| And second of all, I want to remind you all of some recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Maybe some of you all, none of you all were on the commission, but I was a Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| It was this commission, not you all standing, but the Knox County Commission that saved Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| If you remember, the school board wanted to close it down, and this county commission, and I think appropriately, stepped up and saved this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2426)|
| 0:40:36| Really, all we're asking for is just a little time to look at all of our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| I think we're not asking to derail a budget or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| We just want a little bit of time, if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| Do you have a suggestion as to how much time you'd like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Well, I'll have a report back to you, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| I would like to have it at the next commission meeting, let you know the direction that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| I think 60 days would probably be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| I know 30 would be pushing it, but 60 would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| Because if we don't, I just think we owe the people of Carter an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| And I would hope you all know me well enough to know that I'm serious about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| and I would like to take every opportunity that we could in those next 60 days to explore every avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| If I come back in 60 days and can't do it, I'll be the first to tell you that I can't do it, and that we can't do it, and just we need to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| But I would like that opportunity, given that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| We have some commissioners who want to make some comments, and so I'll take them in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| Commissioner Briggs, I believe you were first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| I'm going to pull this out, and I hope you can hear me better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| And I apologize to the people on the television if you couldn't hear me earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| I thought I was speaking into the microphone, but I hope you can hear me now because I can't get much closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| To any extent, I just wanted to make a comment on this, is that when I talked to Dean Rice in the mayor's office this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2526)|
| 0:42:15| and I heard Mayor Burchett yesterday on television, and one of the things that I think is really refreshing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| for once, when the mayor says you'll have to trust me on this, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| Because I know he's working on this, is that one of the things we want to avoid is either having a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| or adding to the debt that we have already, because I know part of what the mayor wants to do is to avoid both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2556)|
| 0:42:45| The second thing that I'd like to mention is that I think that every person on the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2565)|
| 0:42:54| and probably every person on this county commission would vote in a second for a new school at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| if the financing can come through in an equitable way where it does not harm the rehabilitation of other schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2581)|
| 0:43:11| or other needs, other capital needs that the school system may have. All of us want that for the children because it's the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| It's just a question that when you look at the county as a whole, can we afford to give one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2598)|
| 0:43:28| you know, pretty much a very large chunk of the budget and then not have something for the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| But I do want to make that absolutely clear, is that I think every elected official on the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| and the county commission would like Carter to have a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| The final thing that I would like to do is whether the mayor can find these funds or whether he can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2623)|
| 0:43:53| I'm going to make a substitute motion that we approve the capital budget for the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| as originally proposed by Dr. McIntyre and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| The commitment that I would like to have from the school board is that they won't go immediately and spend those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2646)|
| 0:44:15| but if the mayor can come up with additional monies and it is approved by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2655)|
| 0:44:24| by the county commission to build a new school, we'll just add those on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| That way if we cannot find the funds for it, the money will be there without having to come back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2670)|
| 0:44:41| to start a renovation if that's what's decided by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| If he does find additional money, we just put the new monies on top of what has already been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| for the capital plan and move on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| To get back to what we can really do, all this body can do is approve a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| We can't tell them how to spend the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| So either way, whether it's for a renovation or whether it's for a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| the money will be there for either one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| The motion has been made and seconded to provide the $5 million to the schools for the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Go back to Mr. Kincaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| You don't have to come up here unless you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| You know, you made some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| We're two bodies that have two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| And Mayor Burch alluded to one point I was going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| The school board wanted to close Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| During times when they closed my high school, they closed rural high school, they realigned a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| They began shipping students from Holston Hills to Gibbs Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| And so the commission did step in and did play in their other sandbox a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| But it was to the betterment of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| And, you know, I did in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| I did make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| But now there's another potential needs to find this new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| I think the new school is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| And you've made the comment that no matter what amount of money we gave, y'all wouldn't build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| Well, that is, you know, the school board came to the last administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| And they said we need a new high school in south or northwest Knox County or west Knox County in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| And they couldn't afford to put it on their capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| And the county commission, you needed the county commission then for $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| You needed the county commission to make Powell Middle School the appropriate size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| And so it does take two bodies working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| And to say that we're playing outside of our sandbox is, I know Mr. McKenzie made those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2811)|
| 0:46:59| And I understand that I don't want to step in your all's boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| But it takes both of us to get this thing and make it successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| You can't do it without us and we can't do it without you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| And to make those comments in public, I was disappointed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| And if the commission didn't step up, you know, Fulton would be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| There would be no Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| There would be no extension of Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| And so I think we do need to work together instead of publicly trying to embarrass or humiliate each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| Would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Commissioner Andrews, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| You took that as I was not meaning to offend or humiliate anybody in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| I just was trying to make the Board of Education's point about why we're asking for this appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| I completely agree with you that we all need to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| And it does take the whole community to educate our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| It's my recollection that as far as the need for the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| that the Board of Education at the time had decided to add on to Carnes, Bearden, and Farragut high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2885)|
| 0:48:14| and had asked for funds to move forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| And then decisions were made in other places outside the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| And that's how we ended up with Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| Anyhow, I didn't mean to say anything except talk about this history of this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| between Knox County Board of Education and Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| We have been back and forth on this issue many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| And I think that the Board has made a big effort to respond to your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| I hope you all would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Just because we still have come to the same conclusions, even with five newly elected board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| doesn't mean it's not the conclusion that needs to be supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| I guess I just have a general question or concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| I saw where the mayor left, and I'll say a few things and probably ask Dean Rice a question in his absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2952)|
| 0:49:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| I guess, you know, one of my concerns at this point is if we're talking about something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2966)|
| 0:49:36| this kind of nebulous something that's going to come in 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| that's going to find this $10 million and make all of these things go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2981)|
| 0:49:52| and we're talking about not increasing debt and not raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=2992)|
| 0:50:01| If those three things are true statements, then I'm left with some concern as to where these funds will come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3001)|
| 0:50:15| I have a project, not I, the school board has a project in my district that is of unique concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3015)|
| 0:50:26| Much older than Carter Elementary is in dire need of rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3026)|
| 0:50:34| We have accepted the fact that the school system has done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| I don't think anyone can point to one project, a remodeled renovation project, that was not a quality project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3040)|
| 0:50:51| Commissioner Andrews spoke to his alma mater, Holston Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| It seemed like a very difficult project to complete, but it won awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| There was an award given, I guess, last year or the year before because of that remodeled project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| So, you know, my constituents who attend Chihuly Elementary are taking that, those renovation dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| taking the school boards, not just at face value, but looking at past practices, track records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3075)|
| 0:51:23| things of that nature and saying, if they say it, you know, show me some data where it's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| And I don't think anyone can find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| I guess back to my question, if you're talking about not raising taxes, you're talking about not increasing our debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3095)|
| 0:51:45| and you're talking about coming up with these funds to build a new school, are we talking about other projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3105)|
| 0:51:56| So I'm just going to ask the direct question of Mr. Rice or the mayor, and that is, would any other projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3116)|
| 0:52:05| and I like a guarantee, would any other projects on the table be in danger of being not fully funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3125)|
| 0:52:15| or not funded at all under this 60-day moratorium on making a decision on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3135)|
| 0:52:24| I have one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| Tim Burch at Knox County Mayor. The simple answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| Second question is, in terms of Commissioner Briggs, I don't know if you're in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| he made a substitute motion that we fully fund, basically restore that $5 million into the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3160)|
| 0:52:51| but has asked the school board to basically apply the brakes lightly to allow you time to get this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3171)|
| 0:53:01| get your project underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| Is that something that is doable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| If those funds are there, that way if it doesn't come, we don't have to take any other motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| Also, is that something that you'd be willing to entertain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3193)|
| 0:53:22| Well, the simple answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| I'd like to appreciate those nice things Dr. Briggs said, but the end product will be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| I mean, the date of implementation of the budget will come out at the same time regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| So I would just like, I like the original motion, 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| I don't want our hands to be tied in looking at these other things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| I'd like this sort of a stand alone if I could, and that's why I would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| I would just like to have 60 days at all possible, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| If I might just clarify, we do not have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| The motion on the floor is to provide the $5 million, so we do not have a substitute that is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| I'd like to make a substitute motion to delay for 60 days, but see what Mayor Burchett and his staff can come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3249)|
| 0:54:18| So we do have a substitute motion on the floor for a 60-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| It has been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Let's continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Can I change the wording to January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Is that sufficient, January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| It doesn't put a daytime on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Commissioner Wright, I'm going to get to you, but I would rather go to Commissioner Boyles first, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| Thank you, Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| I have a few comments that I want to make, but first I want to ask Indy Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| is how would this affect the school board to delay this for 60 more days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| What would be the consequences of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| Thank you, Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| First, I think that Commissioner Briggs' motion, I don't know whether it's a substitute or original, I wasn't paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| His is a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| The motion that he mentioned, I think that that's a good way to accommodate the mayor's wishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3318)|
| 0:55:28| and also move forward as quickly as possible to fix the deficiencies at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| If you supported Commissioner Briggs' resolution, that means appropriating $5 million to the Board of Education today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| I can vouch for us delaying for 60 days or some date in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| You can set a date, and then if he's able to find additional funds towards new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| then we can bring that back to the board and consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| And if he's not, then we'd already have the $5 million and we can move forward right away without having to delay once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| Because what we've asked for and what I think the motion he presented was $5 million appropriation for this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| not to wait until the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| So if we delay 60 days, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| If we delay until the next fiscal year, that's another whole year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| and that's another year of the students being in suboptimal conditions, which nobody wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| I wanted to speak to what other consequences this would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| Our current fiscal year capital budget is a total of $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| You've already appropriated $10, and while we have the authority to spend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| and whatever the things are that we have delineated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| we have committed to spending that on the things other than the Carter Elementary School and middle school improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| So the board is not going to hold hostage the other elements of our capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| which are physical plant upgrades for $5 million, roof and HVAC upgrades for $3.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| foundation stabilization and so forth, including the phase one of Chilhowee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3424)|
| 0:57:12| improvements to Chilhowee Intermediate, which is $150,000 in year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| We are not postponing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Those are already moving forward because that appropriation of $10 million was approved back in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| Also, by means of clarification, I want to make sure everyone understands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| the law director has opined that Commissioner Briggs' motion was the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| and so now we have a substitute on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| So I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Commissioner Burwell, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Yes, actually I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| This is the thing that I've been struggling with from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| and that is that we as commissioners are beginning to hear from parents in other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| whose children are going to schools that need upgrades, that need renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| and they are rightly concerned that we are looking at spending more money on Carter than is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3482)|
| 0:58:11| to bring that school up to where it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| funds that would otherwise be spent at their child's school, to bring them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| And if you can come up, Mr. Mayor, with another $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| then I would hope that you would want to put it towards the next school that desperately needs attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| because we all have schools in our district that need renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| And, you know, I've done a lot of research on how the school board has handled this in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| and the fact is that the majority established communities in Knox County have schools that are renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3521)|
| 0:58:51| That's how we reuse and repurpose these structures, and that's how it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| And so I feel like what we're doing is spending money on Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3536)|
| 0:59:08| even if you can come up with additional money, it still needs to go to the next school on the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| because these aren't the only kids who are in school buildings that are suboptimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| And I would hope that you would have as much concern for other students across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| as you do for the students that are in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| I feel like if we build a brand new school for Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| then that is an established community that is going to be getting more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| than any other established community in Knox County has gotten or can even expect to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| And I don't think that's fair to the other communities, the other established communities in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| I don't think it's right to keep this money from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| We have been back and forth on this many times, and it's time to turn this money loose to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3592)|
| 1:00:03| And I'm very sorry, but I would need more details to feel at all comfortable in waiting 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3603)|
| 1:00:15| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Thank you, Chairman. Am I being heard close enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| I just had a couple of things to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| I don't know if add is the correct term to use because I probably won't say anything that hasn't been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| We've been talking about this for six months now, I believe, but I've been relatively quiet about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| When I think of all the things that we as commissioners have been elected to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| a set of tax rate, a budget, all these things we've done early in the last 30 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| and that we'll do the next couple hours, zonings and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| it strikes me that one of them is not to tell the school board where to build a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| I just don't think that's in the job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| But I have supported these delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| I've been to Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| I know how passionate Mr. Underwood and the people out there are and how passionate my colleague Dave Wright is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| and former colleague Bud Armstrong and Mr. McMillan and the other people that have represented and represent that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3668)|
| 1:01:17| It just troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| I frankly think we've pushed the envelope pretty far on this one, probably too far, frankly, further than I think we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3679)|
| 1:01:29| And I think I recall seven or eight, nine years ago when the – let me qualify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| I think we've got a great school board, a professional school board, a reasonable school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| And I'm not saying the one that was there eight or nine years ago wasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| but there was a big lawsuit then between the commission and the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| and I bet tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars went up in smoke to resolve some issue that I don't even remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3707)|
| 1:01:57| There's not ten people in the room that did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| But nevertheless, I know how bad people want the school out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| I would love to see the school out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| And if the mayor and his staff can come up with the millions necessary, I hope that school will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| I don't think I've got the authority to say Ms. Kincannon and Dr. McIntyre and Ms. Feigin and others build a school at a cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3733)|
| 1:02:23| I don't think I've got the authority to vote that way or to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| And if we do come up with the money, the mayor and the commission, I'm fairly doubtful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| I'm skeptical that the school board will say or will agree to build that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| If the money suddenly appears and we can appropriate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| I'm skeptical that they're going to say we want to build Carter School with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| Again, this has been a tough issue for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| I think it has been for all of us because we keep kicking it off and kicking it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| I do support a few more 60 days to look at this further if the mayor asks for it and he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3782)|
| 1:03:10| I can support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| I would like to get a little bit of qualification though on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| The substitute motion is to have the mayor report back to us in the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| Okay, the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| And I will concur with what Amy just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| I have had other people in the community, some west, more north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| I think we've had some emails from the Shenandoah people saying how badly they need a new school in their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3816)|
| 1:03:44| We've had lots of mobiles and portables and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| But I feel that we owe it to the mayor's office and the people at Carter to go to January on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3827)|
| 1:03:56| although I think we're, again, pushing the envelope. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| I have several points written down that I'd probably like to hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| but the thing that comes to mind first is the fact of if the substitute motion were affirmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| the $5 million was restored to the budget, capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| then that money would be appropriated and there would be no backing up on it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| That's always been my understanding, and I think at every commission meeting that's been affirmed by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3867)|
| 1:04:35| This is not line-item veto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| This is the presentation of the county mayor's budget with capital expenditures in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| and some of them have been held for a very specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| There are lots of other projects on the capital plan which were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| some of them large and some of them in expectation of student populations not yet existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3892)|
| 1:05:01| There are 400, 450 kids at Carter that we're trying to take care of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| It is all about whether or not we want to have an average facility for those kids to go to school in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3905)|
| 1:05:16| I didn't fuss about any of these other projects that were on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| There are no other projects on the table today except Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| All the others that the school board brought to us have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| We are only talking about Carter Elementary and it being in a hole and having certain problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3929)|
| 1:05:37| One of the other things that sort of irritates me in a way is that we keep going back over all the problems that we've had in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3937)|
| 1:05:45| of trying to get to where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| That's what we're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| We're supposed to discuss and come to the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| All that has to happen is you all say that Dave Wright has not a single friend on county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| and you can vote against a new school at Carter Elementary 90 days, 60 days from now, whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3963)|
| 1:06:11| That'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| But I think what's happened is that there are more than two or three people here on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| that agree something different needs to happen out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| And I believe there's more than one or two or three on school board that believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| At least they campaigned that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| And if it's not politics that's changed their minds, I don't know of anything else that's in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| Anyway, where I stand right now is I fully support a 60-day look by the mayor to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| to say if we can find five or six million dollars for commission to build a school at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Commissioner Orlandi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| A couple of points I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| One, this is not the first time that county commission has stepped into the sandbox of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4021)|
| 1:07:09| We've done it with Hardin Valley, as stated before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| It's done with Powell Middle to renovate that one and to expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| Those funds came from the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| They're the ones that told us we want you to build this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| We want you to do the Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| They didn't in their wildest dream figure it was going to cost $54 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| But that being said, we already have the land out there for Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| It was bought seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| If we do not plan on building on that land, we need to sell the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| We need to do something with it and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Also, it's not a promise that was done in the last administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| This is a promise for the past 20 years that this community has been promised and promised and promised a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4069)|
| 1:07:57| It is time that we as citizens and representatives of this county step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| If the mayor needs 60 days to find the money, if he can find it without increasing taxes, without increasing any more bonds or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4082)|
| 1:08:11| then I say we give him the 60 days, and if he can, then we can build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| But we have a promise and obligation to every citizen, not just west, north, south, also east, and we need to provide service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4096)|
| 1:08:26| And we were elected to make the hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| If we don't want to make hard decisions, then we shouldn't have ran for the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| I'd like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Any other commissioners that have any comments, then we may be ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| The reason that we have Hardin Valley High School, and I was around when this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| was that it wasn't because of the county commission or the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| It was because of the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| The parents at Farragut High School, I remember attending the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| Farragut High School gym was packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| They were standing in the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| They were demanding, not asking, demanding that overcrowding stop at Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| We needed a new high school in the west sector, and I represented the west sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| My very first meeting on county commission was to vote on whether we should increase the wheel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| or whether we should have a property tax increase, and it went to a referendum of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| So it was the parents in that area who were driving the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| They were saying we're tired of our kids in this overcrowded situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| We need help, and you need to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| And so county commission and school board stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| I see the same situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| This is not being driven by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| This is being driven by the people in the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| They are continually saying to us we need a new school, and I believe that we need to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| I have said before I'm in favor of a new school at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| I am ready to vote to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| I am ready to do whatever it takes to get that new school, and there are several reasons why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| but one reason is when I saw the MPC report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| And when you see the MPC report and how they had looked at all the schools in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| they came back and said the worst school structurally in Knox County is Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4202)|
| 1:10:09| Let's take them from worst to first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| Let's give them a school that is not considered the worst in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| I understand the renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| If we didn't have 26 acres sitting back there, I would go with renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| I also know that the history between the school board and the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| has not been the most pleasant over the years, and I would like to see us try to improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| Remember the Hardin Valley debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| The Hardin Valley debate, once we had decided that we're going to build that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| became should we spend $40 million or should we go with an extra 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| and completely build it out with all the athletic facilities, all the amenities, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| There was a lot of discussion then, if you recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| There were some very testy meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Whether or not we needed it, I remember an MPC report that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| well, all we need is 1,200 students out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| That's all you're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Well, they've got 1,200 students out there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| That was a wrong projection, and I think we did the right thing in going ahead and building it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| But to show you how interesting the rhetoric can become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| there was even a suggestion that because county commission would not approve the extra funds over $40 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| that the kids would show up on day one and that they wouldn't have desks to sit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| and that they would have to eat their lunches on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| And I was even asked that by a parent at a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| Commissioner, are our kids going to have to sit on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| Are they going to have to eat their lunches on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Because you're not going to approve the money for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| And I looked at them and said, do you really believe, I mean honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| do you really believe that we're going to open up a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| and have your kids sit on the floor and eat their lunches off the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| I said, if that were the case, they'd bring Geraldo in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| and we'd have this big expose on Fox News and everything else about the big bad commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| And, of course, you know, they just kind of looked and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| well, it really doesn't make sense that the commission would not approve money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| for having kids with blackboards and all the things that they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| So, you see, rhetoric can get involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| But let's cut through the rhetoric here and let's say, okay, does Carter, in my view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| does Carter deserve a new school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| And to me that answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| Now, I have spoken briefly with Mr. Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| We talked on the phone very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| He says that they have something they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| It has worked in other communities, and they would like the opportunity to pursue it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| get us details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| I don't know what those details are, but I would be interested in seeing those details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| because if there is a creative, innovative way of doing this that has worked in other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| I think that we have that obligation to look at it, and let's see if, indeed, it does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| If it doesn't work, then let's come back and let's say, all right, let's release the $5 million and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| But I believe the administration deserves an opportunity to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| Do we have anyone else that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Briggs, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| Yes, thank you again, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| I just wanted to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| First of all, let's make it clear to everyone what we'll be voting on and what we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| My motion, it turned out, was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| That's all it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| And then there was a substitute motion to delay this 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| And I'm not defending my motion, but I think both of them were going to accomplish the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4380)|
| 1:13:08| I don't think there's really any difference, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| But for that reason, I'll go ahead and withdraw the motion that I had so this can become a primary motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4390)|
| 1:13:18| I need a second to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| Who's his second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| I need a second to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Amy, do you withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| He's withdrawing his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Do you withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| Is there any other comments from commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Yes, Commissioner Bronson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Ms. Kincannon, I understand that the mayor has shared some details with some of the commissioners up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| Have you had a meeting with the mayor, and has he disclosed to you what his plan is or the details?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| Commissioner Burroughs, I've talked to Mayor Burchard about it, but I've not been privy to any details at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| I'm hopeful that at one point, when he's comfortable, he'll apprise us of the details because I think I share the same perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4429)|
| 1:13:59| And the board wants to know the details, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| I guess he'll have 60 days to work on it, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| But, no, I do not know any of the details I've asked about it, and hopefully they'll be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4448)|
| 1:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| I also just want to make a comment on we as commissioners and what I often see us doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4456)|
| 1:14:25| When an issue comes up involving certain branches or certain departments, and there's something that comes up that's controversial for different reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4465)|
| 1:14:38| lots of us like to say we don't want to micromanage that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| Those people are professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| They know what they're doing, and we don't need to butt in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| But there are times, too, and I've seen this, where we do go in and micromanage departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4488)|
| 1:14:57| and it just depends on, in some cases, which side of the political fence you're on and, other times, which side of an issue that you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4497)|
| 1:15:07| So I just want us as a commission to be aware of when we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4507)|
| 1:15:15| The micromanage argument gets used a lot up here, and I just want us to be aware of that, that the school board is a completely separately elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4515)|
| 1:15:31| They were elected to make hard decisions, and they do make the hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| And they have in their mind, in their charge, not just the good of one community, but the good of the entire county and all the county's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4537)|
| 1:15:49| And I have supported their capital plan from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| but when questions came up for me about what this renovation was and what it was going to cost and what was included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| and I did quite a bit of research on what the school board has done in the past and what needs to happen in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4560)|
| 1:16:09| and I just feel like this is a place where the school board has a good track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4569)|
| 1:16:17| They know what they're doing, and there are many, many schools in the queue waiting for funds after this renovation is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4577)|
| 1:16:25| And to spend more on it than what is necessary, I think, is doing a disservice to other established communities in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4585)|
| 1:16:33| So I just want to make it clear that I will continue to support the school board and what they bring before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| because I have a great deal of respect for them as an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| So, but I am interested to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| I wish that we had a little more details to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I'm not comfortable delaying this without more information is the other issue for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4611)|
| 1:16:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| I will be supporting the now original motion because I do trust the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| I trust that he's going to show due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| I think he's not just asking for 60 days for 60 days' sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| I'm trusting that he's going to shake the trees and get very creative and bring us something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| or bring the school board something that they can deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| So for that, I thank him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| I do, however, want to comment on, you know, a few of these statements that I guess have come out as a result of this discourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4652)|
| 1:17:43| You know, in terms of hard votes, it's not hard to support a room full of people cheering you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| It's hard to support a capital plan on a community that's right next to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| That's what's hard, and it's extremely, extremely hard for me to support the original capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4677)|
| 1:18:07| So don't say I'm, you're getting cheers and you say I'm making a hard vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| That's not a hard vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Going the popular way is not always the easy way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| So, you know, I guess I do take offense at folks saying that I'm taking the hard route sending this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| No, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| No, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| And the second point is we are playing in other people's sandbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| Let's call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| It is, but it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| Like you say, there's reasons, and that's why I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| But don't say no, we're not playing in other people's sandbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| We're not playing political football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| We're playing football with a body that have overwhelmingly said in all ways, shapes, forms, and fashions that they don't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4728)|
| 1:18:58| So, not to say I agree with them, but to say that no, we're not doing that when they voted 908181 is really disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4738)|
| 1:19:08| Say that we're persistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Say that we're going to, we really, really want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| Say that, and I'm with you 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| But don't say that no, we're not throwing rocks at another political body because there's been several of them chugged during this discourse today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4756)|
| 1:19:27| So, you know, and if this leads to a break in the relationship, then we'll have to accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4767)|
| 1:19:35| But let's not fool ourselves into saying that, you know, we're the high and mighty ones on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| We have the community on our side, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| And that's why, again, I'm supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| But the other kind of statements I really think are, you know, they're just, they're not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4786)|
| 1:19:56| So, with that said, I will support this, and I'm going to support this, and I anxiously anticipate the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4796)|
| 1:20:05| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| I guess I better speak on this since I'm the only teacher up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| And so I'm obligated somewhat to speak about an important educational issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4819)|
| 1:20:27| First of all, when there's problems, a really kind of intractable problem like this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4827)|
| 1:20:35| where it seems to be where there's a lot of conflict between two significant bodies here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4835)|
| 1:20:43| there might be an opportunity within that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| And certainly I see this swelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| Certainly there is a swelling of sentiment probably among some of us on this board and some on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4854)|
| 1:21:02| And so when I consider that problem, and this is over a very focused issue, Carter School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4862)|
| 1:21:12| and its renovation or its rebuilding, whichever it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| I think that, well, maybe this might be an opportunity for those bodies to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| So I'm going to be in support of, I mean, I'm going to vote in support of the Mayor's proposal for a number of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4882)|
| 1:21:31| and that's one, that it might offer us an opportunity, and I'll make this suggestion publicly to the Chairman right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4891)|
| 1:21:40| that it might be, and I alluded to this at the work session, that it might be something worthy of something like a session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4900)|
| 1:21:50| I don't know how we'd call this, and Mr. Jarrett may weigh in on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| but something like a co-executive session between the boards where we could talk and discuss a very defined issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4914)|
| 1:22:05| That's a very rare thing for those bodies to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| because generally when we're dealing with the school board, it's always over the budget, which is a very diverse issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4929)|
| 1:22:19| So here we've got a very defined issue, and so we might be able to create some helpful dialogue and relationship building over a real focused issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4939)|
| 1:22:32| And so that's why I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| The only other thing that I had to say in reference to this, there are some other issues that I'm not thoroughly convinced that have been completely vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4954)|
| 1:22:46| And so some of those issues, you know, when we talk about cost-benefit, risk analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| I'm still not comfortable with some of the environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| So it does give us more time, it gives me time to get more comfort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| and I think it might be something that potentially is productive for these two boards. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| I think Commissioner Norman makes a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Mayor, would you be interested in having like a joint session of a commission and the school board to present your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4991)|
| 1:23:19| We could do it at the next commission meeting, but I think it might be helpful for the schools and the commission to set up maybe a special workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| or something for you to present this. Would you be in favor of doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, that's an excellent idea, and I appreciate Commissioner Norman making that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5009)|
| 1:23:36| I think that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| Okay. We'll get together then with our calendars sometime after the first of the year rather than presenting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| We can do it in a work session and maybe vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| Yes, sir, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| And if we don't, if this plan doesn't fall into place, then there might not be any need for it, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5029)|
| 1:23:56| Then we'll just go back to the original proposal, but I think that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and if commissioners are okay with that, I would be more than happy to host that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| Great. Thank you. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| Well, the motion, is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| The motion on the floor is to have this heard in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| I hate to use the word defer because we've kind of been criticized for deferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| I want to make it clear we're not deferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| We're giving the mayor an opportunity to present us with some ideas that have worked in other areas for the possibility of funding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| And so I think that we deserve, that folks in the Carter community deserve the opportunity to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| and we will have a joint work session should this plan come to fruition where you will be presenting it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| It will be a non-voting session, obviously, but the opportunity for everybody to hear it at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| Page 7, ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| amending sections 2-581, 2-647, 2-691 of the Knox County Code relative to contract modifications and emergency purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5099)|
| 1:25:10| This is ordinance 0-08-5-101 adopted June 23, 2008 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| I'll be a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5127)|
| 1:25:35| Discussion on tax collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| Yes, Commissioners, very briefly, if you have noticed the trustee report from Mr. Duncan, the trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| I just thought it was interesting to note that as of year to date, our tax collections for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| sales tax and property tax, up almost $4.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| I think this is important to note because it shows that perhaps our local economy is improving with $2.7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5156)|
| 1:26:04| I believe is the amount for the property tax collections, $1.6 million in sales tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| So for $4.4 million over last year, that's a very healthy number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| and I thought that that should be made public for everyone to realize that while we're not out of the woods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| perhaps this is an indication that the economy is getting better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| The last thing I'd like to bring up is our December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| We're scheduled to meet on December 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| That is the week of Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| It has been suggested that we move our regular meeting up to the 13th and that we have the workshop session on the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5189)|
| 1:26:37| What is the pleasure of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| Go move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Okay, so we have it on the 13th, regular meeting with the 6th on the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| No, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| The clerk was telling me that we only voted on November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| So for everyone to know, our regular commission meeting then will be December 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| Our workshop will be December the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| We will not be meeting the week of Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Commissioner Broz, did you have an announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| One is that I've gotten a message from Lauren Ryder, who is the president of the Old North Knoxville Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5225)|
| 1:27:14| and she wanted to have me remind everyone that we're hosting our 22nd annual Victorian Holiday Home Tour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5234)|
| 1:27:24| and Old North is providing two tickets per commissioners at Will Call, and we hope that you will all be able to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5244)|
| 1:27:33| Ten homes will be open and decorated for the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| It's the first weekend in December, and we always have a great turnout for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5256)|
| 1:27:44| and we hope that the commissioners will be able to come and be part of that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| Also, I wanted to remind everyone that our community Thanksgiving potluck dinner is next Monday night at 6 o'clock at Central United Methodist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5268)|
| 1:27:58| and I sent out some invitations for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| I hope that you'll all be able to join us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| And since it looks like we're about to wrap up, but we don't have to be downtown for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| if anyone would like to join me at Beans and Greens across the street for a bite to eat before we go back downtown for zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| that's one of the newest restaurants in the second district, and their food is absolutely incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| Commissioner Wright, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| I would like to remind members of the commission that the Three Rivers Rambler is looking for readers on their Christmas excursion train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5307)|
| 1:28:37| Please call Jody Cottle at 524-9411 if you can be a reader on the Three Rivers Rambler Christmas tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5317)|
| 1:28:47| See me after a while for the number. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| Also, next month in December, just as a reminder, it looks like that the Midway Road rezoning sector plan change is going to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5331)|
| 1:29:01| I'm expecting that to take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| Also, that evening, many of us would be attending the West Knoxville GOP meeting, or Christmas meeting that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| So, would you be interested in moving the zonings up to 5 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5351)|
| 1:29:18| Well!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| I was going to see what Sam would have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| I mean, is that something you would want to consider, or go ahead and leave it at 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| I say let's move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| As long as all parties are notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| Right. We give ample opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| Let's do that. Let's see if we can have our meeting at 2 and see if we can start zonings an hour early at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| Again, the Midway may take a little time, but we'll spend the time necessary to make sure it's properly vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| Any other issues or business to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| If not, again, thanks to the folks here at Fulton High School. You have been very nice, very gracious to us, and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5395)|
| 1:30:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| We're going to go to section C of the agenda to the amendments to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| Do we need to read it in before we request to table it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Okay. If you'll read it in, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| On page 9, amendments to the Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| This is 0-10-11-103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| In consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee, amending article 4 of the Knox County zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| to add a new section, 4.103, regarding standards and requirements of flea markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| ordinance number 0-90-9-130 adopted September 10, 1990 as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| Without objection, I'd like to table this until we can get with the zoning ordinance changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| That requires second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| It will be tabled and brought up again after the zoning ordinance is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| Madam clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| It's just tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| On page 8, 10-B-10-RC is request of Robert G. Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5469)|

| 1:31:21| The property located southeast side of East Emory Road, southwest of Emory Point Lane in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5481)|
| 1:31:29| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5489)|

| 1:32:54| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Mr. Donaldson, I just wanted, or Mr. Wright, I just don't, I tried to find this online and I couldn't find any information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5577)|
| 1:33:06| I don't know whether my website was working properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| So I just wanted some description when I hear something like, you know, a mineral operation and soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5590)|
| 1:33:21| It just sort of makes my antennas go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| So if you would, Mark, would you go over that some with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| I could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| This parcel is a 64-acre parcel on the north side of Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| Currently, it's generally a borrow pit and it's zoned planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5620)|
| 1:33:48| One of the provisions of planned commercial is the requirement for a plan of operation and a conditional use permit for mining or mineral extraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5628)|
| 1:34:01| The applicants have been removing topsoil and I believe that they're consolidating stone and rock for distribution on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5641)|
| 1:34:18| And as such, fall under the purview of this plan of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| The site is actually kind of ideally positioned for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| There's a small ridge close to Rutledge Pike, then a little bit of a valley and then a larger ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| And all of the operation has been taking place in that bit of a valley removed from the highway to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5675)|
| 1:34:44| So they've been active on the site for five or six years and are simply kind of moving into a stockpiling and distribution operation for rock that is accumulated over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5684)|
| 1:35:02| and some that they are planning to bring into the site and then redistribute from this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5702)|
| 1:35:10| Okay. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| And Mr. Wright, has there been any concern of residents or such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| No, this operation is consistent with other things along Rutledge Pike in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| And I would move that it be approved per MPC recommendation with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| With the ten conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| Are you aware of those ten conditions, Walker family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| I've got a motion. Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5741)|

| 1:35:54| This is deferred to December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| Do we need a motion for that, clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| 9-D-10-RC is request of Ron Scott, Jr. or Ben Kaiser for rezoning from A Agricultural to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5766)|
| 1:36:15| Property located northwest side of Gwen Road, southwest of Oak Ridge Highway in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5775)|
| 1:36:22| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| Is this the one we moved last month too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| So at this point, what do we normally do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| I know we normally defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| If they don't show, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| What's the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| So if the applicant's not here the second month in a row?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5801)|
| 1:36:53| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| You have a choice of continuing it or you can just deny it or remove it from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| I mean, generally, your practice has been there's been no contact at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| They haven't shown any interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| Mr. Donaldson, have they made contact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| Not that I am aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| And it may be because the MPC recommendation was to deny the rezoning on the significant parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5831)|
| 1:37:19| the one that they were most interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| and to approve it on parts of two other parcels that were kind of captured by the property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5841)|
| 1:37:28| So they may have lost interest in it because of the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| Mr. Chairman, I move that we continue it for one more month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| and if there's no action next month, that it be removed from our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5859)|

| 1:37:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| If the commission has no objection, just for the interest of due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| I would recommend you just allow me to send him a letter informing him of such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| telling him that he doesn't come here next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| We're going to presume it's withdrawn and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5877)|

| 1:38:35| Could we add his name to the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Well, is this his first absence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| And we do contact them as well, but it wouldn't hurt to get notice from another entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| Mr. Law Director, will you contact them and advise them if they're fair to show, remove them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5927)|

| 1:39:09| Commissioners, the zoning ordinance will be heard at 5 o'clock on the 13th of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| So, everyone in earshot, you got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5960)|

| 1:39:27| 5 o'clock, not 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| You mean for your zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| Yes, provided you send adequate notice, which you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5972)|

| 1:39:43| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| And on the subject of the zonings being moved up, is that a permanent change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| It's because of Midway Road being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| We have more time to go into the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| And that would be something that maybe next month I'd like for us to consider a permanent move of moving the zonings up to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101115?start=5997)|
