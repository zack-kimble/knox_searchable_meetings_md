| 0:02:54| too. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. Thanks for the chance to provide a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| few updates. I'd like to begin by highlighting two important events. Last Wednesday, I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| the privilege of attending the KCS Region 5 Stakeholder Breakfast, which we held at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| the Change Center. It was exciting to reflect on the first year of implementation and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| the plan to hear about the incredible work that's begun in Region 5. As you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| Region 5 Strategic Plan includes actions, metrics, and milestones to foster high expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| and strong achievement outcomes. While I was pleased to hear from students, district leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| and teachers about the progress that's already been made in one short year, these reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| were also a reminder of the important work that's still ahead for us. The Region 5 Strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Plan was created with input and long-term commitment from parents, community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| private sector and non-profit partners, and our students. Our work is nowhere close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| to finished, but our meeting last week proved to me that the continued support of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| and dedication to our students, teachers, and administrators will be able to transform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| the plan into success for every student in Region 5. So I want to thank again all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| who attended the community breakfast and a special thanks to our Region 5 educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| for their amazing work. Very important work, and you know, like we said, we know this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| a marathon. I know Ms. Owen, Rev. Butler, and Ms. Henderson were all there. Great chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| to just see that and hear from our people who are doing the work. But there is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| work to be done, so excited about that. I also want to point out that the 2024 KCS Recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| Fair will take place on Saturday, April 6th at West High School. We're always looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| for outstanding teachers, administrators, and school staff, and the Recruitment Fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| is an excellent way to learn more about opportunities that are available to join our team. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| that's 9 to 11 is the time for that. Okay, good. Got confirmation from Jennifer. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| you know someone who would be a great candidate, please encourage them to visit our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=283)|

| 0:04:54| And finally, in just a few minutes, Jennifer Himmelgarn, our Assistant Superintendent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Business and Talent, will be presenting a report about our proposed salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| This proposal is based on the compensation and classification study that we conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| in recent months, and Jennifer will provide all the details. But I do believe this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| gives us a sense of our efforts to prioritize our district employees and team members, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| it demonstrates how much we value their work. I want to thank everyone in our Business and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Talent Division for their extensive work in this proposal, which has been quite a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| a lot, and you'll hear more about that today. I know you've been hearing about it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| last couple of months. And then finally, I want to remind families that on April 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| we will be, it will be a half day for students as Knox County experiences a partial solar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| eclipse. This is a great learning opportunity. The Science Department will be providing educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| materials and solar glasses for students to safely observe the event with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| Kudos to Andrea Berry, just a side note, talking to the East Tennessee Superintendents, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| they were all, they're all doing half days now too, since we did, but they were, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| were asking, apparently there's a glasses shortage, and Andrea had the knowledge to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| weigh ahead of time, buy them for like cents on the dollar, and if we could make money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| we could make a ton, but we're not allowed to sell things. So kudos to Andrea Berry for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| doing that. So, Madam Chair, that concludes my report for the evening. That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| Thank you, Dr. Reislich. I think next up we have Dr. Brown. You have a report on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| student success review. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. Just wanted to give you guys an update. Since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=379)|
| 0:06:28| I've now been in the job six weeks, I thought it was a good time to let you know where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| are and what was going on. Well-seasoned. That's right. It didn't take long. All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| I'm going to mess this thing up. Turn it on. Turn it on. Pro tip. There we go. All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=399)|
| 0:06:48| so again, just wanted to revisit the KCS way for special education. Obviously our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| goal in this is to provide quality educational, a special educational experience for all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| our students. Also, I think on the agenda tonight, we mentioned this was a student success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| update. We are going to focus tonight on special education. That doesn't mean we're not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| work in the LL space and all those others, as you all will see, and some of you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| already talked through the budget. There are some additions this year for ELL teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| and supports. We're opening a newcomer academy in the fall, so some exciting work happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| there. But tonight, we're mostly going to talk about special education and just that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| strategic direction that we're providing. And tonight, specifically, we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| talk about some of the website improvements and also our RFP that's going out to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| deep dive into our practices and all of our special ed scope of work. But before I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| into that, I thought I'd take an opportunity just to share with you all a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| my history and where I've been. I know a lot of us have talked, and I mentioned at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| the last board meeting how, you know, after getting over the initial shock of having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| new job eight months into the new job that I just took and really having time to reflect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| I feel like this is a great place for me to be, and I don't think there's a better place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| to make a difference in the life of students, and so I'm really excited about this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| As a teacher, I spent seven years in the classroom as a biology teacher and was immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| immersed in the world of special education. In my first semester, I had a co-taught class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| and even throughout the seven years, you know, most teachers think that the pathway to success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| is working your way up to teaching AP classes, and I did that, and then all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| I found my principal was giving me inclusion classes again, and I thought that was a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| of my ability to teach. Then a few years later, I became an administrator, and what I realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| is, no, that they trusted me with those students, and they knew that I would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| care of them, and so really, I feel like my career has been about identifying and removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| barriers to education for all students, and that's why I'm excited about this work. After| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| leaving the classroom, I became an elementary principal, and I spent ten years in the elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| school. My elementary school in the district, I was not in Knox County at that time, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| I spent ten years at an elementary school, and my school in that small district was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| one that housed all of our special ed pre-K programs, and so, because it's a small district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| what they tried to do is, we couldn't have a continuum of services within a single school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| and so each school had a certain thing that that was their program. After developing relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| and building trust with those families, they didn't want to leave. They didn't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| go to a program at another school, and so we actually expanded programming, and we added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| programs at our school to provide that continuum of services within our own school building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| and then when I moved back to Knox County and became a secondary principal, I spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| some time in a middle school that had a very robust special ed program, and then also then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| moved to a high school where we did a lot of work, not just in the special ed world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| but then also had pretty significant ELL populations, and also did a lot of work with the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| culture department, so with Janice Cook and her team, really looking at positive behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| strategies and restorative practices, and saw a great, as a matter of fact, my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| at Southville Middle School, I actually wrote my dissertation on the results we saw, reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| suspensions by 76% at the middle school, so really exciting things, but the thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| I found through all of it is, none of that happens in isolation. You have to have a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| team of people around you, and that's why I'm so excited about this opportunity, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| because we have a lot of great structures in place, and we're heading in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| We've got a parent council that we're working with, and we have a principal council we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| working with. We have great department and great people. So, a little bit about kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| of our path to success and what I feel like is the way to get there, and I kind of alluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| to this a minute ago. I think it all starts with relationships. I think everything meaningful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| that happens has to begin with relationship, and through that, building trust, and so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| have started this work by trying to build those relationships. We've already met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| all the key stakeholders and talked about the work and gotten some feedback from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| just beginning that working relationship, and through that, I feel like they get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| know you as a person and get to know your heart for kids, and that's what's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| and that's how you establish trust, because there's always going to be those times where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| we may not see eye to eye on how things go, but if at the end of the day, people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| that your compass is doing what's right for that student, then I think you build some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| trust in that. I mentioned a minute ago collaboration. None of this work is done in isolation. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| takes a team, and it takes a village, to quote the African proverb, but we have to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| group of people surrounding each and every individual student, making sure that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| collective knowledge is making the best decision for the child, and I think when you do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| that the end result is success for every student, which is what we want. So, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| finding those common goals, committing to creating those opportunities, and overcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| those barriers, and I think that's the key to success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| All right, so just a quick recap in my first six weeks, and again, some of this may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| a little bit repetitive, but again, a lot of it for me has been getting to know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| work and getting to know our team and our stakeholders. As I mentioned, I've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| had the opportunity to meet with the Special Education Council a couple times. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| a text thread, so I'm constantly in communication with them, making sure we're all on the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| page. Again, working together, I think that's the biggest thing that I've seen, is there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| a perception, which in a lot of cases becomes people's reality, and the perception is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| we're on opposite sides of the table, and I think that that perception has to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| We have to prove that we're all on the same team, and we're all working for students to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| get better outcomes. So, met with the Special Education Council. We've had some great meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| and gotten a lot of great input. I've also met with our Principal Council, talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| some of the things and how our work impacts them at the school level, and how we can support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| them in that work, how we can provide professional development and other things to prepare them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| to be great leaders in the world of special education within their building. I've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| had some individual parent meetings. I've had parents reach out to me about concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| they've had, and so we've talked about those things, and hopefully, again, just establishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| those relationships and beginning to build some trust that we're going to do the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| thing for their students. As far as where we're going with the things that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| promised prior to me coming on board, I think the next steps that we're going to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| so we have submitted the RFP. We've been working with County Procurement to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| As of today, I'd have to pull up, I left my phone over there so no one would bother me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| but the county has it. They are planning to do the final revision. They think it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=819)|
| 0:13:48| be published Thursday or Friday, and then we'll go live next Monday, so that's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| exciting. We're also working on some other concerns that I've heard about private practitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| Again, I've told everyone who's emailed me about this, if you think back six months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| we didn't allow private practitioners, so the fact that they're even in our buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| at all is a lot of progress. Have we perfected the process yet? Absolutely not, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| going to continue to work on that, and we're going to work together as we all have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| discussion at policy review. We're not in the right place yet, but we're working in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| the right direction, and that does take time, and I understand that's patience is virtue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| and I don't always have it, so I understand the frustration that people feel with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| but we are making great strides. We're moving in the right direction. The work is not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| The work is never done. We still got a long way to go and a lot of work to do, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| I want to go back to what I said earlier. We have great people. There's not a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| person on our team that I haven't taken something to, and immediately they've said yes, or I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| was already working on that, or I've got this ready, so we've got great people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| ready to do the work, and at the end of the day, every single person on our team shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| up every single day wanting to do what's right for our students, so that's encouraging to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| A little bit about, again, our website improvements. The whole purpose of this is really just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| make life easier on parents. Hopefully, we're going to see improved navigation and quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| and easier access to the support that they need. We're also going to be updating information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| You can't really see over there, but there's going to be a lot of links to documents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| things where parents in one click can get to what they need, and what you see in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| really small print there is that consolidated special education resource library where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| have the resources for all the things, and again, met with the special ed council. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| showed them this. Our communications team did a great job of rolling this out and showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| them some of the proposed changes. Took some feedback, and we're going to make some edits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| I think at this point, the plan is as of next week, we're going to roll it out and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| it live, so again, I don't know what buttons you push and how that happens, but apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| that's going to happen next Monday, so we'll see how that goes, and again, I promised to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| the council and to everybody is that, just like with the private practitioner, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| not going to be perfect, but hopefully it's going to be better than what we had, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| will continue to work on it in that spirit of continuous improvement, and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=975)|
| 0:16:23| in August, we're going to see a complete relaunch of our entire website, so hopefully we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| piloting something here for the special education website that hopefully we'll see full scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| this fall. RFP I mentioned, again, what we're looking at is a comprehensive review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| of all of our special education services, our systems, our structures, our supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| We've seen some really good reports and really crafted the RFP to do a deep dive, to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| a look at, and there's not a single person on my team that hasn't said, like, we're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| in favor of continuous improvement. We want to get better, because in the end, our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| are the ones who benefit from that. Out of that report, what we're hoping to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| is some recommendations of some very actionable, evidence-based efficiency and efficacy improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1026)|
| 0:17:14| and then obviously the end goal is to develop then a three to five year player of implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| of those recommendations, so hopefully we will walk out of this with a three to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| year plan to get us headed in the right direction and continue to make that continuous improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| with some measurables moving forward. So, as I said, it's been submitted. They're telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| me, just like the website, next Monday's going to be an exciting day in the world of special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| ed, so we're going to have the RFP going live and hopefully the website, so we'll hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| at that point, you know, have some good people make proposals and we'll have some vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| that then we can bring to you guys and move forward with that analysis of our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| All right, so, again, I've probably mentioned most of this, but looking ahead at what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| got going on in our next steps, as I mentioned, we're still working on the private practitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| Some members of our team are working on that. We're going to work back and forth with council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| and Mr. Dupler will get his input on that. We mentioned the potential development of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| an MOU. I don't know if that's where we'll land, but we're going to, again, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| to check it out and see what works for everybody and make that happen. Continued improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| to the website and providing those special ed resources for our families. The next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| after the RFP hits the streets and we get some selections, we'll bring back to you the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| selection of a technical assistance partner who then developed our strategic plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| special education. And, again, this work never ends, so we're going to continue to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| our special education council, with our principal council, making sure that all the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| we're making, they work at the school level, they work for the parents, they work for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| the students, and just approaching everything with that spirit of continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| And I just want to say, again, I mentioned last time, I really do appreciate this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| This is an exciting opportunity for me. I think I mentioned to several people when Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| Ryswick asked me to do this, they said, congratulations, I guess. And I said, what do you mean, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1154)|

| 0:19:24| one of them. And not just that, I'm biased, but in my opinion, he's asked me to be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| assistant superintendent over the most important one. And that's the area where we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| the greatest impact on students and removing those barriers, whether it's a language barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| with our ELL students, it's a learning disability, whatever it is, it's our job to identify and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| remove those barriers so that every single kid can experience student success. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| our goal. So, have any questions? Ms. Byke, I see you have your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| I have a question. Thank you. I appreciate all this work that you're doing. I know everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| is working so hard for this and I'm excited to see our website improved for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| I'm curious with this rollout, if you'll be including either with the rollout or at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| point some sort of infographics that are a little bit more digestible for kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| like a process of like, for private practitioners of like, you know, start here, this, this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1222)|
| 0:20:31| yes, yes, no, yes, no. And then also for like special education of like where you start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| and stuff like that. Because I know a lot of parents, sometimes it's just understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| the system and getting confused. Sure. Yes. No, you're exactly right. And yes, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| the purpose is to make it easier to access all of those things. That document, like I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| said, those little black, those were all links to places. And when we went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| again, that was one of the things the parents said, well, this is great. Like, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| can click on this one thing and it says, you know, I have a question about how to get an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| IEP or, you know, I have a 504 or my student had an S team, what's next? So really just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| trying to slow walk people through the process because you can get lost in the weeds. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| so we want to make sure that everybody has a good understanding of how to access the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| services that are available to their children. Okay. Yep. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| Dr. Brown, thank you for jumping all in. Yeah. We both feet twice in less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| So I appreciate you doing that. I just have one question. I know that you're working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| the RFP is about to be out in the public and working on getting a technical assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| partner. When would you hope to have a strategic plan completed? I know it's a three to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| year plan, but what's your goal in terms of trying? I mean, I'd love to have it. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| is not realistic. First of all, I'll tell you, I'll be completely realistic. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| never been involved in this process before. I mean, obviously, just leaving the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| I don't even know the time for that. It has to be on the street before we can begin looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| at people. And I know we've got to have a certain number. So I'm brand new to this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| process. And like I said, I'd love to have it done and work on it and, you know, have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| it ready to roll out for next school year. But I realize that's probably not a realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| goal. Like I said, I don't know the. January, OK, I'm not a county, I'm deferring to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1333)|
| 0:22:21| law. Sorry, I would have to look at Jennifer for procurement timelines, but I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| that you would need to do this work meaningfully, probably a minimum of two to three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| of working with that technical assistance partner before you actually even begin to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| look at implementation. So probably second semester at the earliest. Yeah. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| probably honestly, I would say that's even probably a lofty goal, just because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| with the scope of what we're asking and having 60,000 students in 91 schools, for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| truly take a look at our practices and, you know, look through all of our our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| and the way we operate and go and, you know, visit classrooms and see what inclusion looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| like and see what all of our our continuum of services looks like for students. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| probably going to take a while for them to actually do the research and dig in before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| they can even bring us recommendations. And then we'd have, you know, from that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| to develop a strategic plan following that. So January would be great. But if we can even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| have it done, you know, within the next school year and then have it ready to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| for the 25, 26 school year, that would probably be. Yeah, thank you. And thanks for the candor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| for that, because for people who are been chomping at the bit for this, which I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| there's a fair amount. Sure. I want to make sure that we set reasonable expectations that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| you know, there's a process to this and we're not necessarily going to get there fast, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| we can get there. Well, right. If we do the right things in between. So, yeah. And as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| I mentioned before, it'll happen as soon as it can happen. Sure. I'm I'm not a man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| who's been blessed with a lot of patience. And I freely admit that. Like I see how things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| can be and I want them to be that way now. And so, you know, I will I will work as hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| as I can to get it done as fast as we can get it done. Because, again, it's like everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| Our kids deserve it. So. Cool. Thank you. Yeah, I just appreciate the work. I know you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| welcome to your first presentation to the board. Good job. You did well. I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| say if it wasn't as good as Miss Lautner's, that's because she does the presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| and I think she has a bias. I think that's probably fair. That's probably fair. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| last week, last month, we had the best presentation ever. That's true. We did. She| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| probably sabotaged me. I think that's probably fair to say that. I know there's been a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| pressure around the private practitioners, I know, trying to get all that figured out. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| that's a new new thing for us. And so now, obviously, this administrative procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| are trying to work on. Do you expect that to be finished before the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| school year? Are you thinking that's going to take some time to figure out? And I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| again, that may be one I need to defer to Mr. Dupler on. We're working on it currently and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| then we're going to take it back to the council. Obviously, I think what we left the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| meeting with is let's let's fix the procedure and let's get everything in line and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| adjust the policy. So, you know, I know that Chelsea Price is working with Alicia Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| right now to to work on some edits to that procedure and make sure we include maybe some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| stipulations about if we're going to allow teleservices, what that looks like so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| really outline that so we maintain consistency in all of our buildings. Sure. So once we get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| you know, we'll present that and, you know, let you guys know and make whatever adjustments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| bring that back to policy review along with the changes we've made. So, you know, where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| I would say realistically I don't think we'll have anything in place before school's out. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| mean, it's April now. I'd say by the time we get through this and even if we could bring the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| policy back to you guys in May, you know, that wouldn't leave a whole lot of time left in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| school year. So I would think realistically we're probably looking at a process that would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| be hopefully in place and fine-tuned a little better for next August and the start of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| I agree. Good. Well done. Well, if there's anything we can do to support that or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| even bringing something outside of policy review to the May meeting if you feel like that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| necessary, I think we'd be happy to take a look at that and, you know, see what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| Yeah, we're currently working on the procedure. And so, like I said, if we can just make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| changes in the procedure and it doesn't require policy review change, then, you know, we'll make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| sure we outline those things there and advertise that and post it and make sure that all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| BCBAs and our private practitioners are aware of the change in procedure so that they can fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| in line and continue to provide services. Perfect. Appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah, I agree. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| we really appreciate this. Welcome to, you know, your second new job. That's right. You're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| a great job. I appreciate it. Thank you for all your hard work. I think, you know, this work isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| easy at all, but it's very meaningful work. And I think we all agree that we want to see results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| and, you know, the changes that the students and families deserve. So, thank you for all the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| you're putting in. Thank you all. I appreciate the opportunity. Lots of presentations tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1626)|

| 0:27:20| members of the board, like Dr. Roswick said, this has been a significant undertaking from a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| people in the business and talent division. And Scott Bolton has led that group for business and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| talent and has been the primary contact with Evergreen Solutions LLC. So, we are going to tag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1652)|

| 0:27:44| on our employees. Perfect. Sounds good. Madam Chair, board members. Hello, Mr. Bolton. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| Madam Chair, board members. Thank you for this opportunity to talk about something I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| is really exciting that a lot of people are, there's a lot of rumblings going on about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| but it's been exciting to be a part of it and implementing this. Let me make sure. Do I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| to turn this on? Okay. You turned it off. There we go. There we go. Now we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| This comprehensive salary study is investing in people. And I will say that it's strategically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| investing in people. Making the effective investment in people because we're determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| based on market value and comparing to other districts. It is a significant difference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| what we've seen in the past. And we're focusing on the greatest asset that exists in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| Schools in terms of moving the needle for our student performance, which is our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| And this was an opportunity, again, to identify national best practices and leverage in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| compensation strategies and really make a dent in the employee retention and recruitment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| We were looking at creating consistency across the board when it comes to our job classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| and our compensation together to make sure that what one position is at one school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| it's equivalent to that in another school and it's paid appropriately there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1745)|

| 0:29:16| And when we talk about market value, we look at that comparison that was made across 19 other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| different school districts and what that looks like with relative to cost of living in each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| place and then simplify our existing salary structure. It's pretty complex for a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| people to see. So again, $39 million is a lot of money. It's a lot of money, but it's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1776)|
| 0:29:44| opportunity to give the opportunity to put the money where it needs to be in the efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| and effective way. And that means every person in KCS. There will not be a single person that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| makes less than what they've made before. And by and large, the large majority of folks in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| County schools will see an improvement in their salary over the next year. We hope that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1801)|
| 0:30:08| fewer vacancies. We hope that means improved retention. And we hope that means doing what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| right by people. So it's huge. And this is Evergreen's recommendation. They recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| that the district adopt a methodology to transition employees to salaries in the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| pay plan that aligns with its established compensation philosophy and meets the available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| financial resources of the institution. So basically, let's take the money, let's look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| what we can afford, and let's invest that in our people in an appropriate and effective and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| efficient way across the district. So when we look at this, there is a change for a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1840)|
| 0:30:48| in our school district, but for the most part, not a significant change for the majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| employees in our school district. The majority of employees in our school district are, by and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| large, our certified teachers. And they will see something that's similar to what they've seen in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| the past in a sense that there will be a lane and step scale that is based on a bachelor's and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1860)|
| 0:31:09| master's degree and steps out over 20 years. What you will notice on that scale is that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| consistency between each of those steps, that there is a bump at steps 5, step 10, step 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| and step 20. And the intention of that is to promote retention. So I'm getting close to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| larger bump in my tenure here with Knox County Schools and staying to that mark. And that bump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| is a significant bump. You'll see four times the amount of a difference in that five-year bump than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| what you'll see in the previous bump. So there's consistency across the scale. There's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| widening of the scale. As we have typically administered a 4% administration of a percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1906)|
| 0:31:54| increase, you have also seen the disparity increase by 4%. And our consultants have told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| that where we want to stay is about a 65% spread in that. And every time that we do a 4% increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| our spread continues to get wider and wider and wider. So this brings alignment into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| It eliminates the administrative and supplement scales that we currently have. So you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| going to see a way more simplified version of our salary scales going forward. This is a profile of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1938)|
| 0:32:27| each different subgroups. I know this has been something that a lot of people have wanted to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| at. Please know this isn't proportional, so you can't like track back and look at what those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| proportional amounts are. There are things that went into considering where each of these would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| be, but you can see a sizable increase. And we tried to look at the span across each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| different categories of folks. On the left-hand side, you'll see the profile of a teacher. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| wanted to take snapshots at different places in the tenure of that teacher and across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| different grade levels, grade bands. I know they're probably moving away and pulling off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1978)|
| 0:33:06| degrees above a master from the scale. There's a lot of angst about that. So I wanted to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| a representative picture of what that looks like going forward. You also see a special ed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| teacher assistant. And what was nice about this job class study, we were able to separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| regular TAs from special ed TAs from satellite TAs. So we've created that on our job scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2004)|
| 0:33:32| and doing that. So here's a profile of a SPED TA, and we spent a considerable amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| talking about those and filling those vacancies and how critical they are to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| delivering the mission of the schools. And so I wanted to take a picture of what it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| on Step 1 and Step 14. I want to also draw your attention on this one, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| because you've got Step 14. Our typical scales where our TAs would fall would end at Step 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| Now that scale is going to progress out to Step 20. So you're going to see some folks that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| been long-tenured employees with us that have been stuck on Step 14 for a longer period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| get the benefit of advancing beyond that related to how long they've been in that job class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| This is a typical profile of an instructional coach that you'll see. Again, previously what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| we had on our salary scale was this convoluted. You get this teacher base, then you get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| supplement on top of it, you get a different contract. Now we're just going to have a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| line for those that are instructional coaches, and they'll be assigned to a grade band, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| can see with full transparency where those folks will fall on that scale. And let me go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| this. In making that transition, it's important that I looked at different periods of tenure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| throughout the school district, different opportunities. And so you'll see a reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| to early career and late career. So as we moved away from a single lane scale into a multi-tiered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| lane scale into a more simplistic, it's hard to actually generalize to some extent. So I picked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2099)|
| 0:35:07| specific points for people to look at. Here's another profile of a custodian. We've had a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| of conversations about those, and you'll see that represented here in terms of what does it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| mean to a custodian who's on step eight and how they advance in the next year. We wanted to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| at an RN. So I looked specifically at RN, RN early in their career versus late in their career, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| also a secretary. And just to draw, as you may recall, the board has been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| generous, and a custodian previously you all had graciously granted a 12% increase to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| custodians, to secretaries, to TAs. And so you'll actually see a sizable increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| there as well. Then I also wanted to pull in what does the profile of a principal look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| Again, a principal, an assistant administrator, an assistant principal. So this way you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| kind of see where they would land. And previously, again, where we were building on top of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| complex system, a teacher base, a supplement on top of that, going to a single lane in our scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2170)|
| 0:36:18| And so this is, to the left-hand side, a principal, an elementary principal, that's kind of at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| middle of their career. And then you'll see where they were, where they end up, and then take an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| example of a middle school principal, similar, at the middle of their career. And you can kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| see what that looks like going across those different job classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| This is the grade band for the certified staff. Again, it's a little different from what they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| seen previously, but I'll just point out the differences between those. You're seeing nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| on the scale above a master's. That will be paid on a stipend aside from that. But you're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| two grade bands, and what you'll notice here is going to be equal distance apart of that. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| important as we look at our scales that from one step to the next is an expected amount that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| there. I want you to notice particularly to those large jumps. You can see how they stand out. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| know, we may want to look at marketing that for the purpose. You see from step three to step four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| is the same thing from step one to step two. But when you get to step five, you get a shot in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| arm. And you can see that here. You see a big jump when it comes from step four to step five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| You'll see that same jump when it's going from step nine to step ten. You'll see that same jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| again from fourteen to fifteen. So you'll see those jumps on the chart for the purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| being systematic for retention and things like that. But it's transparent. It's full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2267)|
| 0:37:56| what we can expect, and hopefully it has that retention aspect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| So the next one is, when I show the next slide, it's going to be, there's a lot going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| But if you look at a sheet of paper, I promise it's way more simple. We have a general pay grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| that have, or forty different pay grades to the left-hand side of it. That's representative of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| every position in the school district fits along one of those pay grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| And then the transition to that pay grade, where the person will be, will be placed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| different factors. For the purpose of transitioning to this, we're looking at class year parity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| which means if they've been in the position to some extent for five years, then they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| to be on step five of that scale that's aligned to it. There is a caveat to that. One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| things when we pursued this process was we didn't want to take anybody back a step. So if a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| comes in somewhat, there were a handful of positions that were actually above market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| and some things like that. So the correction that we used for that, they would be laterally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| slotted to the appropriate step on there. So that's something that we would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| But on this pay scale, you'll see a progression of four percent between each pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2347)|
| 0:39:16| And you'll see that as you go across. Again, it completely eliminates the administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| supplement scale that we previously had. And then the positions that were based off that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2360)|
| 0:39:28| certified scale. So when we were looking previously on the teacher base, and a lot of these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2368)|
| 0:39:37| are on the teacher base, but some of those positions previously were not on the teacher base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| They were on a classified or a Z scale or something like that. There was no application of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| any degrees or certifications higher than a master's degree or a bachelor's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| What's nice about this is we'll be able to actually stipend those people with higher degrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| and certifications, much like we do with teachers when it comes to those amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| Hey, if you happen to be a teacher's assistant, but you've got a doctorate, guess what? You get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| $5,000 stipend on top of that. So it's not just limited to certified folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| It goes throughout all scales. And just to keep in mind that on this scale that we're presenting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| there's 40 grade bands, but from 36 to 40, there's nobody going to be placed on those scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| Our salary consultant said we want to get a scale in which we could grow into should we ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| need to grow into. And so there's not going to be anybody placed on the top four of our scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2432)|
| 0:40:41| That's a lot, isn't it? So as you look at this salary scale, each job class will be assigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| to a potential, will be assigned to a class grade. There's a caveat to this in a sense that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2449)|
| 0:40:59| the University of Tennessee Systems, which we share a building with, went through a three-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| class study and actually came to the same conclusions that we came to in terms of grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| class of system that's very simple, very similar to this. And it's interesting, you can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| look at their positions, where they fall on what's been projected on ours, and we're pretty spot on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| when it comes to those job classes. So it's been pretty interesting to triangulate between somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| who did, a whole other group did a similar study, and we get similar results. This that's presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2486)|
| 0:41:35| for you is going to be the hourly rate bands. And the reason why I bring that to your attention is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| that we still have some complications when we're talking about different contract lengths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| So we have, expands out our bi-weekly folks are on 260-day contracts. Our year-long monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| folks are on 255-day contracts. We have 221-day contracts. We have 205 contracts, 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| So this is the most simplistic way that we can put this in so that everybody can see what those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| hourly rates are. Some folks contract lengths and hours per day are different. We have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| folks that are on a seven and a half hour day, and some that are on a 7.75 hour day, and then an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| eight hour day. So that the hourly rates is the easiest way that everybody can see what that looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| like going forward. This is what hap, this is in addition to those folks that have a master's plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| 30, or an EDS, or an EDD, or a PhD. This is the educational stipend that they will receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| And something I'll draw your attention to is that this this amount is regardless the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| length. And the reason why I say that and bring that up to you all is if I'm a teacher in a classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| and I have a PhD and I'm teaching in the classroom, I'm getting $5,000. If I'm an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2569)|
| 0:42:56| assistant principal on a 221-day contract and I have a PhD, I'm getting $5,000. So it's not tied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| to the annual contract lengths of that. And essentially as you look back and track it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| it's higher valued in the classroom than beyond. So with that being said, I'm going to turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2587)|
| 0:43:16| to Jennifer to finish this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you, Scott. Madam Chair, members of the board. So why implement in one year? When we came to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| back at the quarterly work session, we said that we may be bringing a phased implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| So we have shared that the full implementation would cost $39 million and we were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| sure that we would be able to do that in one year. We are sure now. So why implement in one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| Because it brings all of our employees to market value at the same time. It doesn't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| the district and it doesn't require the board to select certain categories of employees to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| go first in a phased implementation. And what that would also do is increase compression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2640)|
| 0:44:08| for a period of time. And Kristen from Evergreen explained what that might look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| if we advanced some employees to a new scale and not others at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| And also we know we can do this. We have visited the budget and revisited the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| And thanks to the foresight of the budget team, we built capacity in this current budget for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| non-recurring costs that we can put towards this salary study implementation in one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| should the board vote on Thursday to move to these new salary schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| Why vote now? There was some questions at the quarterly work session and also at the March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| work session when Evergreen was here as to the timing of the vote to transition to the new salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| schedules in advance of voting on the proposed budget at the end of the month. The vote now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| will help the district should the board vote to implement these new salary schedules. The vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| now will allow us to be prepared for a July 1 start date for the new salaries. As you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| it is a significant undertaking. We have nearly 9,000 employees that would be transitioning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| this new scale and making sure we get it right would be very important and require some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| We do believe that we are prepared to do that and are excited about the possibilities that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| could bring for both current employees in the district and future employees in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| How did we get here? We got here in a couple of different ways. By paying down debt or putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2749)|
| 0:45:57| $23.1 million towards debt service in the current FY24 budget. Putting it towards debt service is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2757)|
| 0:46:06| putting it towards non-recurring costs, so dollars that would not be committed in a following year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| budget. That has created capacity for us to put some of those dollars into recurring costs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| into salary study implementation. We prioritize schools. We have significantly reduced district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| level spending. We have created sustainable budgets at the division level by reprioritizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| the spending and putting an emphasis on protecting the classroom and funding what works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| This approach identified $13.4 million for us to invest in the salary study recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2799)|
| 0:46:48| Planning ahead, we don't plan to use all of that debt pay down, all of that $23.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| We don't plan to put all of that into the recurring costs of the salary study, but plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| put some of that into non-recurring costs again next year in the budget that we bring to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| at the end of April to allow us to create capacity in future years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| What's next? As you know, on the board's agenda this week, we are asking for approval of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2831)|
| 0:47:19| Evergreen's recommendation to transition to these two new salary schedules. As the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| has pointed out previously, and we would call out as well, voting on that now does obligate a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| significant portion of the proposed budget for FY25. That proposed budget will be brought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| the board at the special called meeting on April 25th. July 1 is when the new scales would become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| active, should they be approved this week. Just for logistics, I believe that Scott hinted at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| a little bit, but it would, because of the time frame, each employee will get an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| notification as to grade band placement, step placement, annual salary. Those likely will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2881)|
| 0:48:09| all happen at the same time, but will happen close in time. The employees that are year-round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| would receive a first paycheck on the new scale in July, and employees that are not year-round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| would receive that first paycheck on the new scale in August. So we would prioritize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| employees that would fully transition first and do those notifications on a rolling basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| as we get closer to the time that those payments will be received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| So that was a lot. Do you all have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| Thank you. Again, thank you for all of this work. I really hope that our teachers and staff and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2925)|
| 0:48:54| families are going to be really happy with this. I think the question we might all want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| is where are the custodians going to be on this step? Do we know that yet? Or on the big spreadsheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2939)|
| 0:49:07| of things? Yes. Wait, let me get back here. So where custodians will, and as Scott explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2947)|
| 0:49:17| not everyone will receive the same increase, and that shows that some of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| are closer to market value than others. What we did not anticipate tonight is announcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2965)|
| 0:49:34| where specific categories of people fall, categories of positions fall on the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| We want to make sure that we have reviewed Evergreen's recommendations, every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| employee, before we get out in front of those announcements, but will provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2984)|
| 0:49:52| individual notification to all employees. When do you think you would have something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| So, Scott's team, the team that he has assembled, has already put a plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| for implementation. So should the board approve this week, then we expect an announcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| to staff members shortly after that that approval has been made, and it'll probably be a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| weeks at least, but those individual notifications would start after that. And so, just to ask a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| couple more questions about this, so when we're looking at the profile of a custodian and it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| step eight, does that mean they have been in their position for eight years, or does that mean they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| have eight years of experience? How does that come together? Sure, that's a good question. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3033)|
| 0:50:40| as Evergreen shared in March, what they are recommending and what we intend, the way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| intend to implement, is for our teachers as step plus one. So that would be pretty easy once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| now that the teacher, proposed teacher scale is public, that's pretty easy for a teacher to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| where they may fall on the new scale. What they are recommending for the general scale is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| class year parity. So that's taking number of years in the position, or step on the position that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| in and transferring. So this would be a custodian with eight years of experience moving to the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| scale. Okay. So, because I know like last year when we talked about some of this stuff and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3076)|
| 0:51:24| talked about consideration when a custodian comes on as a new custodian to us that we would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| some experience, would that still happen under this? Yes, it would. So our current practice is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| to consider up to five years of relevant outside experience and Scott, one of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| of Evergreen was for us to convene a team to see how, review all of those procedures going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| So Scott has convened that team and is working on it. We do not anticipate that that will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| Okay, thank you. This looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you both and everybody else who's put so much work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| into this. I haven't had my one-on-one meeting yet, but I'll just ask the question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| I'm trying to understand how potential cost of living increases in addition to the scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| impact the scale. So Mr. Bolton, you talked about that the spread between each area is four percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| like as you go down it. Am I right in calculating this that if for some reason, let's say over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| next 20 years, we decide every year to in addition give a four percent COLA increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| is in effect that means that people with their step and their COLA increase get an eight percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| increase year to year? How does that, how do they work together is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| So a couple of things that when we think about previously, the way that we have done it is we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| said, okay, everybody gets four percent, so your salary is increased by four percent. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| in the scalar properties there, anytime that you multiply by four percent, you've also increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| the disparity between the lowest by four percent. What Evergreen has recommended that we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| the midpoint. So we look at the midpoint of this graph, look at what four percent looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| that same so that it maintains the integrity of the spread of 65 percent across. So when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| talking about four percent, you're talking about four percent of the midpoint across all grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| bands. Okay. And so that it maintains that difference from one step to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| I got you. I like that a lot better. And I do, I do want to say one more thing based on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| based on your question. I just want to clear up that there's not four percent of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| I just want to clear up that there's not four percent between each step. It's the categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| down the column. The categories down the column. Right. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like I did a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| bit of math. It looks like it's in some, it's about three percent going right to left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| Is that right? There's a probably pretty close to that because there's a 65 percent spread across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3238)|
| 0:54:05| the whole. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit, a little bit less than three percent. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| yeah, in terms of job category, I guess, I mean, that's essentially what the rows are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| right? Like based on category is where you're going to be slotted in there. There's a four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| percent difference all the way down the scale. And if you, no matter what column you're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| whether or not you're in class one or class 14, if you go down, that's going to be four percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| is what you're saying. Correct? Correct. Like between 101 and 102, for example, four percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| Right. And any potential cost of living increase is applied after the step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| So increase. Right. So like if I'm moving from one year to the next in my position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| I get my step increase. And then if the board approved a four percent, that four percent is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| top of my step increase that's already been applied. So, so yes, but it may not mean like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| Scott was explaining, it may not mean the same percent. That's correct. Because based on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| midpoint, but my right, regardless of what the number ends up being, it's, it's applied after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| the step, not prior. So, yes, that, that is how we would anticipate. I will say that this moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3305)|
| 0:55:14| to these new scales will impact how we give increases in the future because we are, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| making a large effort to bring everyone to market value. So, so increases may look different in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| future. But yes, if we give an increase across the scale, then we would get the increase and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| people would progress up the scale. Yeah. I mean, to me, there's two really positive things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| happening and what you're saying. One is we're looking at the midpoint and trying to decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| that disparity, but also the fact that we're looking at potential increases even beyond that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| a little bit more creatively. Right. It's really, it's, it's easy from a math standpoint to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| let's just get everybody four percent. It creates a lot of challenges, which I know this salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| study is trying to solve. And I guess what I'm saying is I'm glad to hear that we're not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| solving the challenge. We're solving the thing that caused us part of the challenge. Does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| make sense? Yes. We're not repeating some of the same mistakes that maybe we, you know, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| saying that anybody did anything wrong, but we're trying to correct some things that we could wake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| up 20 years from now be thinking, oh, we get, we're in the same situation because we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| creating our methodology at the same time we're fixing the tool. Right. That makes sense. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| So thank you. Thank you. Mr. Triplett. Yeah, I appreciate the work y'all did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| figuring all this out and also trying to explain it all to us. You don't fully understand it, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| that's, that's an excellent job. Just to clarify, nobody's going backwards in this, right? You start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| asking people's pay and that makes everybody nervous, right? So nobody's going backwards at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| all. And that's good. And then I assume that this will probably get answered in more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| in the one-on-ones, but it kind of exactly where, you know, you talked about cutting spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| you know, at the district level and that kind of thing. I assume we'll dive into that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| more, kind of in those budget meetings, just to figure out where that money's coming from. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| know you're looking at this. And then the other question I had, I assume we're still looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| the starting pay of $50,000 by whatever, what year is that, 2020? FY27. Yes, we are. So, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3429)|
| 0:57:18| would be on the teacher scale. So this, moving to this new, transitioning to this new salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| schedule makes a significant move in that direction. But yes, we still will be looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| move to the base of $50,000 by FY27. Good deal. Mark? Hey, sorry, Jennifer. Is, I mean, the impact of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| current, are we currently about 44 something? Yes. So that would be, I mean, this would be a huge step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| toward the 50, but it still didn't get us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| Ms. Owen? Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate moving to a dollar rather than a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| That's something we've talked about for a long time, and I appreciate that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| As we're talking in our individual meetings, I think it would be helpful for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| be able to see, instead of just the snapshot of a sample person, or in addition, I guess I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| should say, to see that hourly rate. Because when we're looking at those different job titles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3493)|
| 0:58:22| some of those job titles are working 200 days, some of them are working 255 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| And so I think as we're looking at it, it's important for us to see that something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| appears to be a lower pay may actually be a higher hourly pay because of the days. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| would be helpful for me to see. I've had several questions from teachers who are concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| the stipend. And I see how it's, if you'll go back to the one you were actually on already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3527)|
| 0:58:55| so the concern they have is that by being a stipend on a separate page, it could go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3535)|
| 0:59:02| at some point. So my question is, why would we, is there a difference in having it listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3542)|
| 0:59:11| separately as a stipend and listing it as another column up there so that it would just continue out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3551)|
| 0:59:20| So let me make sure I understand. You mean having the educational stipend listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| just here too? I think that we could, so it won't just apply to the teacher scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| it would apply to the general scale too. But I wouldn't see an issue with making sure they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| appear on the same page when we publish on the website. I think that would take away some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| that concern. It's obviously easier just to say here's what it is. But I think if people could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| see it as BA, MS, MS plus 30, they could see that column, that feels more permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3592)|
| 1:00:00| And I think that would alleviate that concern. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| Ms. Horne. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you all for such great work and this is an exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| thing to be able to do and I'm thankful for it. I would be remiss if I did not ask this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| because I've heard it from a couple of our long-time teachers about the, and I'm sure you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| can anticipate my question, about service over 20 years. Is that accounted for in the grade band or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3623)|
| 1:00:32| can you speak to how those work together? Sure, so and we have gotten that question too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| Evergreen did not recommend lengthening our number of steps and have not recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3639)|
| 1:00:47| for other districts. They've seen a trend towards getting the money to the employee faster. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| having that 20, it's actually zero through 20, 21 step scale. But yes, there are those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3652)|
| 1:01:01| retention bumps. So 20 years would be one of those retention bumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| There's still the educational stipend, the incentive for additional education. But ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| the recommendation was to get the employees the money faster within those 21 steps rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3671)|
| 1:01:20| than to increase. It would, they would still recommend a 65% spread regardless of the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| of steps. So if they, it would take longer to get that maximum amount. Okay, so a teacher who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3687)|
| 1:01:35| worked for the school system for 20 years, they may actually get a larger increase than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| maybe what they would have prior. Is that correct? So let me see what the teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| so that's a step 14. Yes, they will receive, they will receive an increase as a result of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| Okay, okay. All right, great. Thank you. Ms. Pike. Thank you. I have a question about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3716)|
| 1:02:06| stipend. If it's a position that were like a school secretary or a custodian or some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3726)|
| 1:02:16| staff member where a bachelor's or master's or any sort of advanced degree were required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| how would this potentially, would this potentially apply to them? Like if we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| secretary that had a bachelor's degree or a master's degree, do they get any benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3748)|
| 1:02:36| No, so they would, they would receive the market value for the position that they were in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| but the stipend would only come for the master's plus 30, the EDS or the doctorate. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| and do I understand it correctly that the master's plus 30, is that 30 years? 30 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3768)|
| 1:02:55| 30 hours. Okay, thank you. Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| Thank you. So I have a question coming off of Ms. Pike's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3782)|
| 1:03:12| Are those degrees still supposed to be in the certification area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| or in an area that's relevant or could they be in anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| Currently, they could be, they could be in anything, like the doctorate could be in anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| but that, that is how our current scales work also. Okay, I thought our current scales were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| specific to, to in your area, so I'm wrong there? I was just going to add that's actually our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| compensation philosophy team are actually considering those exact things right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| so there could be a situation where we're looking at certifications that are relevant to that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| it's been mentioned in the past, you know, if you've got a CPA in a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| what is that equivalent to? If you've got different certifications, it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| but it's got to be applied to those essential functions of that job. That's been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| but that's not been completely framed out. That will be included when we publish that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| compensation procedure protocol, and it'll be published to the public at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| so we're still looking at some of those things as Evergreen recommended to us to consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| when we're looking at our compensation philosophy. Thank you, and Mr. Bolton, while you're up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| the other thing I think would be helpful for teachers who are looking at over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| you've explained to me that getting that money earlier means there's more money over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| and I don't think everybody can see how that works, so I think if they could see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| the difference in what if we spread it out to 30 years, and what if we have it earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| if there was some kind of chart as an example, so that they could see that they are making more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| money over time, I think that would be helpful there. Not, I mean, not like a chart for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| but just a sample, so that that would sort of be easier to visualize. Yeah, that's it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| that's great. Well, to reiterate what Jennifer said, the recommendation is a spread of 65%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| so spreading 65% over 30 years means that you're taking more years to get to that spread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| and so, yeah, we, let me see what we could do to create that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| Thank you so much. Thank you. Again, I know it's not easy, but very exciting work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| Yeah. Next on our agenda, let's see, Dr. Adams, do you have an update on custodial staffing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. So currently we have 73 openings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| four of those schools are at 50% vacancy, and one school exceeds the 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you. Ms. Christie, do you have a strategic plan committee update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| Yes, thank you. Lots of updates. Yes, lots of updates. Thank you, Madam Chair. Following last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| month's board approval of using two external vendors for stakeholder engagement and strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| planning, the strategic strategic plan committee met on March 25th, and we had originally planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3972)|
| 1:06:20| to review all proposals received for the stakeholder engagement work, but at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| point in time, we had only received two quotes, and after speaking with Mr. Dupler, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3985)|
| 1:06:35| if you want to speak to it, in county procurement, as far as those guidelines went, that if we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=3995)|
| 1:06:46| to proceed without having the three quotes, we would have to go through an RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| That's correct. Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Christie. So yes, so the way procurement works, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4012)|
| 1:07:00| certainly Knox County Procurement would handle an RFP process if it gets to that, and that's when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| the cost is going to be over $50,000, but if it's between $25,000 and $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| then you can use an alternate process which calls for three quotes. The catch is they have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| three bona fide quotes that are, you know, actually given by different companies, so yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you. So after having that information, the committee then had the discussion on the best way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| to proceed, and after reviewing the previous timeline that had been presented to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| felt like it may have been a little bit of a blessing in disguise to push out the timeline by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| about two months. The adjustment will allow us to have a little more time to gather the required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| number of proposals for the stakeholder engagement work, and also to push the engagement process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| the August-September time frame instead of the previous April-May time frame, just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| at the end of school year there's so much other, so many other things going on, and people get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| distracted, and they're trying to wind down and get a little bit of a break, and you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| there probably will be more engagement if we wait until August or September. So saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4093)|
| 1:08:24| and as Ms. Henderson announced, we plan to meet again on April 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| to review any other proposals that are received before making our recommendations to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| on a final contract for their consideration at the May board meeting. Next steps will be to return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| with their final recommendation and contract for stakeholder engagement for board consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| in May, and for the engagement processes to occur in August and September. And just in full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4125)|
| 1:08:53| disclosure, Ms. Coatney takes amazing minutes. I was out of town when this meeting occurred, so I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4133)|
| 1:09:01| know if Ms. Henderson or Reverend Butler, either of you have anything to add or want to speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| or if that sums it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Chair of the committee. I didn't think I heard you mention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4152)|
| 1:09:20| the RFP process also was somewhat delayed, so we would have a gap between, if we had had three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4160)|
| 1:09:32| we'd have a gap between the mutual understanding, I'm sorry, the MOU and the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4172)|
| 1:09:44| So that is another reason why it just makes sense to move the timeline back a couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| because that RFP would be difficult to get in that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4190)|
| 1:10:01| Thank you for sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Chrissy, you mentioned that by the time you all met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| I think you said in March, you only had two, and then you said you're going to meet again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| and discuss any future ones. Do we know, have any been submitted since that date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| since the 25th? So are we beyond three now? Yes, I believe so. Is that correct, Ms. Hallner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| Okay, thank you. Yes, so there will be three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| Any more discussion on this item? Thank you, Ms. Chrissy. I know you weren't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| so thank you. That was a great summary, and Ms. Coatney for your amazing notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| Mr. Triplett, legislative updates. Yes, what would we do without Ms. Coatney and her notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| I know that Ms. Sullivan is going to take a deep dive into some pending legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| so I'll be brief and not take too long, but a couple things. I know we had put on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| legislative agenda the lottery bill, and it looks like everybody who wants to have a cakewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| is heading that direction, so that would be a good thing. The only other bill I want to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| is Senate Bill 2183, it's House Bill 2326, if you want to write those down, that note's down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| but that is related to fourth grade retention and promotion, and that has moved out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4276)|
| 1:11:25| committee into, I think, the finance, ways and means committees now, so it looks like there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| a path that will go into effect upon when it passes with the governor's signature, so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4290)|
| 1:11:39| that there is a pathway to promotion with some tutoring and some interventions in the fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| grade. I did not find, interestingly enough, in there, and I know the staff in Knox County is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| looking at this obviously closely as well, but I did not find anything in there about working the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| summer on that in the fourth grade one, which I know there was with the third grade. Like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| summer school? Yeah, summer school or anything. I did not find that. I may be wrong on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| but it does not show anything related to keeping folks through the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| just really relates to interventions in their fifth grade year. Obviously, they can also be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| held back if that's the choice, but some tutoring and that kind of thing in the fifth grade. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| anyway, you can take a look at that in detail, and I know obviously Dr. Reiser and his team will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| have to figure out exactly how that all works in practicality. We just get to read it and think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| about it and talk about it, but they've got to do the work. So anyway, that's the only, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| Senate Bill 2183 if you want to look it up, but that is the only legislative updates I have. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| let Ms. Owen take care of some of the rest. Great. Thanks, Mr. Triplett. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| Thank you, Madam Chair. It's not going to be a deep dive. It's going to be a kiddie pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| And I'm going to do it from here, so if you'll just pass the thing. Oh, is it up there? Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4369)|
| 1:12:58| So last year, I asked for support on legislation, and it'd be pretty hypocritical of me to not give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| that support, so I want to be sure I'm doing that. Thank you so much. And what I initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| intended was just to give you some information about a couple of visits I took to the Capitol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| So I visited the legislature during several organizations having their day on the Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| and it was great to see teachers from all over the state taking part of their spring break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| and advocating for our schools and our students. I want to give a shout out to TEA for providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| the opportunity for our teachers and their families to participate in civication each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| It's a great time for families to learn about legislation and for our teachers and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| to talk with legislators about the needs of our schools. I don't have the data. It looked to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| like there were a lot more teachers there than usual, and a lot more than I've seen in a long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| long time. Also, there was an annual day on the Hill for Kids, Not Corporations that took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| in March, and it was a joint effort of Tennessee for All and the Statewide Organization for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| Community Empowerment. We talked with legislators about fully funding public schools, closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| loopholes that allow corporations to escape paying their fair share of taxes, and I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| learned that Tennessee is one of only 13 states that taxes groceries. So to move on from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4455)|
| 1:14:22| I may need to switch up right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4462)|
| 1:14:30| All right, we have a few things that I just want you to be aware of that are new public chapters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| We have a fifth grade history requirement. As enacted, it requires beginning with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| 26-27 school year, so we have a little time each district and public charter school to have fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| grade students complete one semester of Tennessee history in the first semester of their fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| grade year. So that's something we might want to be aware of to prepare for. Work-based learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| has increased the number of credits a student may earn in a work-based, whoops, in a work-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4498)|
| 1:15:05| learning class. It's now six hours rather than three. It also reduces the amount of supervised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| work experience required for each additional credit learned, or earned rather. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4512)|
| 1:15:19| school bus notice law that I listened to for a while. It requires that we post in a conspicuous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4519)|
| 1:15:27| notice on each school bus to be sure that it says that no person shall enter onto the school bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| except those authorized by law. And when discussion took place, the Senate wanted to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| why we need this. Don't people know they're not supposed to get on a school bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| And Representative Lundberg said that it's because we have in some areas some parents who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4545)|
| 1:15:53| feel like they are supposed to be on the bus for some reason, and so they are entering school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| And that's as far as they really explained, but apparently that's become problematic in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| some places, and so we are all going to have to have a notice on our school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| So the next thing is the SMART Heart Act. Very basically, it says that we have to maintain an AED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| which we generally already do, but it also establishes some review and other processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4574)|
| 1:16:22| for training annually, and it adds training in CPR, first aid, and the use of the AED to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| annual training for coaches and athletic directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| Another one that's going to be a little interesting and tricky is determining the cause of a fire alarm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| and this is in response to Covenant shooting. It requires each LEA to develop a procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| to determine the cause of a fire alarm, including the potential of an active shooter event prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| evacuating. It requires us to coordinate the cause of a fire alarm, and it requires us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4610)|
| 1:16:58| It requires us to coordinate with appropriate safety teams to incorporate the procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| and it must be implemented no later than January 1st, 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4625)|
| 1:17:13| So those are some major ones that have already passed. A couple that we might want to take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| at. One is, it's been dubbed a land grab, and that may or may not be accurate, but it's basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4639)|
| 1:17:27| that we have to have a list at all times of our underutilized properties, and the thing that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| gotten a little different as this bill has moved along is that it's changing how underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| properties are defined, and it's allowing the State Board of Education to define underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4661)|
| 1:17:48| properties, and we all know that means that we don't know what that definition is actually going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| to be for a while, so we need to keep an eye on that one. Fourth grade retention, it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| that it is in Senate Finance TBA. It is not, so Senate Finance has not scheduled this one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4679)|
| 1:18:12| It is giving us a little bit of leeway in determining how fourth graders are promoted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| fifth grade, and if you look down there at the little tiny paragraph, require certain students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4699)|
| 1:18:27| promoted to the fifth grade to receive tutoring services for the entirety of the student's fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| grade year. If it passes as it's currently amended, it looks like we could make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| to allow a student to be promoted to fifth grade with parent input, teacher input, everyone making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4719)|
| 1:18:46| that decision if we maintain that tutoring throughout fifth grade and possibly even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| continuing on, so that's still unclear, and of course that will be some rules promulgated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| the State Board too. I might also mention that there have been some changes in third grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| regarding rules on when they can be, when they can appeal, so last year what we saw were lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4746)|
| 1:19:15| third graders had their appeals granted very quickly. Those rules have changed. If a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| has a catastrophic event, that catastrophic event has to have happened within 60 days of the TCAP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| test, so let's say something, major death in the family happened 61 days before the TCAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4767)|
| 1:19:35| it's currently assumed that that probably wouldn't count as an appeal, so some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| rules we will need to take a really close look at as we come up on that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| And last one to take a look at, the Educational Freedom Scholarship Act, which is known as vouchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| this is not currently, well, it's being discussed a lot. I don't want to say it's not currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| moving because everybody down there is talking about it, but it's not moving through committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| right now. There's some disagreement between the House and the Senate regarding which version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| to pass, and two of the fiscal notes are there so you can kind of compare. You can see that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| House version is significantly more. There's also another Senate version that is less than the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| that you have here, and we also have in the budget that we have 144 million allocated, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4824)|
| 1:20:34| definitely not the numbers that you're looking at there, so they're going back and forth quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| trying to determine a version of the bill that they could possibly agree on, and right now they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| are not very agreeable. So that's where that stands. Does anyone have any questions on any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4845)|
| 1:20:54| That's about as fast as I think I can go. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4854)|
| 1:21:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| All right, we will move into our regular session agenda. Board members, I just want to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4872)|
| 1:21:20| publicly that the Naming Facilities Committee met last Thursday and made the decision to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| a nomination to name the Carter Elementary School Cafeteria in honor of retired KCS employee Sandra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4885)|
| 1:21:32| Holbert for your consideration. Based on the committee's request, Superintendent Risewick and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| agreed to add that as an item under the regular agenda items. I believe that Ms. Christie will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| provide us, you have a lot of updates this meeting, will provide us with an update when we review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| item on the April 4th agenda, but I just wanted to note that this item was added after the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| was published on Wednesday. So with that, we'll move into our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4913)|
| 1:22:02| Anything on 7a or b?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| All right, moving into items and contracts, c, 1, 2, or 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4923)|
| 1:22:16| Gary. Thank you, Madam Chair. I wanted to talk about the MOU with the Parks and Rec for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4936)|
| 1:22:26| Tommy Shumpert and let me see here, I'm just trying to pull it up, and that's, I believe that's b, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4946)|
| 1:22:34| It's 2. Yeah, 7c2. Okay, so, and I worked with Terry to get you all the latest agreement and it is attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4954)|
| 1:22:47| so I just wanted to make that distinction. On page two, paragraph four, I've added some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4967)|
| 1:22:54| language to make it clear that if the Board approves this, and this is very similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| what the Board's already approved for Carter Park, so, but if the Board approves this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4981)|
| 1:23:08| you are giving Dr. Ryswick and the Commission will give Mr. Mack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4988)|
| 1:23:17| authority to agree on the final boundaries and the final survey for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=4997)|
| 1:23:25| And, of course, the reason for bringing this now, even before the survey's ready, is because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| survey, one, is taking longer than anticipated. Two, we needed to move with some haste on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| because there's already a baseball field out there for Central and we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| for them to be able to take control of that field and be able to maintain that field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| So, if there's any other questions, let me know, but, I mean, I just wanted to point that out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| the plat is not attached and we'd be asking that you give Dr. Ryswick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| the authority to approve that. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks, Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| Okay, four or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. My question is actually related to four, five, and six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| because they're similar. I don't recall in the last three and a half years that I've been on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| board similar agreements coming to the board. Is this a new initiative and, if so, can somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| just talk about the reason for it and what's prompting it? From what I read, I'm excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5073)|
| 1:24:40| about it and I think it's good work. I just, I don't remember seeing this in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| Yeah, Dr. Brown. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watson, no, that is not new. This is an annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| agreement. It's a partnership with all of the, for our, to my understanding, for all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| adjudicated. What time of year do we normally pass those? Because I looked in past spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| agendas and I didn't see it. That's why I wanted to, I wasn't going to stick my foot in my mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| intentionally, so, like, I looked to see if I could find it, so. Thank you, Madam Chair. Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| Brown, I think it's better to say that it's a periodic. Not annual. Periodically comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5112)|
| 1:25:19| It's not annual. Okay. I mean, because this one's for four years. Yeah, so the ones in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| probably could have been for more than that, frankly. Okay. Periodically comes up. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| because, in my recollection anyway, it hasn't come up. Can somebody speak to it? Because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| think it's important for the public to know and understand what drives this and why we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| this. And speaking in generalities is completely fine. I'm not looking for a lot of specifics, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5139)|
| 1:25:49| Yeah, Dr. Brown. Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes, so these are agreements with different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5149)|
| 1:25:57| providers of education. So, basically, these organizations, we have a memorandum of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| understanding with them so that if our students are incarcerated in these different places, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5163)|
| 1:26:10| they have the right to provide the educational services for those students so we can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| their education when they're not with us. Yeah, I just think it's in, I mean, for those in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| public who have not had to engage in the justice system, especially if they've not had to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| their minors engaged in the justice system, I think it's important to know that we as a district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| we as our community value their continued education and try to take the steps necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| through partnering with different entities to make sure that's provided. So, yeah, I think regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| of their placement, they are our students. Right. So, yeah, we want to continue to support them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| until they can come back to us and come back to our facilities. Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| I think, too, a lot of times we go through these items and contracts and go one, two, three, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| you know, there's a lot of great stuff that's going on here and a lot of good things to highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5217)|
| 1:27:05| So, any more discussion on those three items that we just talked, discussed? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| Are the staff, are the teachers at the facilities our staff or their staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| Dr. Brown. They are their staff. Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. Okay, thank you. Yeah, so it's a contract with, uh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5241)|
| 1:27:29| Okay, eight or nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5249)|
| 1:27:39| 10 or 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5259)|
| 1:27:46| 12, 13, or 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5266)|
| 1:27:55| Or 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Okay, moving on to board policies, and these were discussed in policy review. A, A, or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5276)|
| 1:28:07| C, or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5287)|

| 1:28:30| M, or N?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| O, or Mr. Watson? Thank you. I was trying to pull up policy at the same time I was trying to hear the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5315)|
| 1:28:42| N is the public forum policy, correct? Okay. Yes. So, I apologize. I was not able to make the last policy review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| so I'm sure this conversation was had, but on page one of the, of the public forum policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| and I think this is probably the most discussed policy since I've been on the board. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| I'm just, I'm just saying, uh, on rows 16, lines 16 and 17, no, I'm sorry, a little bit further down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| on 37, 38, the lines that says, who remarks are frivolous and repetitive and or harassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5347)|
| 1:29:14| Mr. Dupler, if you would kind of speak to some of the recent case law about what's prompted some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| of our changes, but to me, I'm wondering if it's, if we should remove the words frivolous and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| repetitive. I'm not sure, to me, the person who would be speaking would decide if something is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| frivolous and, and if something is repetitive, does that mean they're just repeating the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| thing over and over again, or does it mean they're repeating something that somebody else already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| said in the, in the group, or does it mean they're just repeating the same thing over and over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| That somebody else already said in the, in the group, and to me, out of the interest of trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| to honor some of this recent case law that's come out, I mean, I would make this more simple and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| just say that, hey, if you're harassing somebody, that's probably crossing the line, uh, but these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| other words, I'm not sure how helpful they are and how we can, I wouldn't want Mr. Triplett to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| say, you're being frivolous, you can't speak anymore, right? Like, I don't know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watson, so the, the wording that you see, uh, comes directly out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5406)|
| 1:30:14| the Sixth Circuit case, Eisen v. Madison County. So it's in there. And it, it is exactly as, as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5414)|
| 1:30:21| court lists it in that case, and we did have a discussion about it at policy review, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| talked about, um, you know, frivolous and, you know, maybe a, um, you know, a definition for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5426)|
| 1:30:34| and I think, I think the discussion at policy review was, if you look at, at the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| policy, and it talks about, you know, coming before the board and speaking of matters on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| education, uh, so if you, if you had a matter that was outside of education, then that, then that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| could be frivolous. Uh, you know, the reason that these words are, are more, more, more approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| to the court than, than, than what was there is that these words, according to the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| is that these words, according to the court, uh, better, better describe a situation that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| based upon the subject matter. Uh, so, um, so that's why they say it does not violate the First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| Amendment. And, you know, certainly not saying that this, that this board has violated the First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| Amendment, you know, in, in, in going through this policy. And this board, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| I agree with you. I think this is probably the most reviewed policy of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| Uh, uh, but, but it's gone through several changes throughout several years in, in, in recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| years to bring it more in line, uh, ever, ever more in line with what the, the courts, uh, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5496)|
| 1:31:44| guide. So that's, that's exactly what this is. I, I agree. I think the context of the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| as a whole can help you kind of hone in on what frivolous is intent, what frivolous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| means, you know, or is intended here. Is there a legal definition of frivolous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| Uh, they didn't, the court didn't, didn't provide that. I mean, I mean, there's a lot of words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| there's, you know, in a lot of cases what, what the court will do instead of having to, to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| some separate legal definition, will simply say whatever the plain meaning of the word is. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| then you would go to a source like, like Webster's or, or a similar source to try and ascertain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| plain meaning. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Watson. All right. O, I, I guess I stopped with O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5542)|
| 1:32:32| We'll just go with O. O or P? Q, R, S, T, the whole alphabet tonight. U, V,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5552)|

| 1:33:22| Thank you, Ms. Hummelgarn and Scott Bolton. Or B, Ms. Christie. Did you want me to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5602)|
| 1:33:31| now or Thursday or does it matter? Just whenever you. Okay, I'll just do it now. Okay. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| the Board's Naming Facilities Committee, which consists of Mr. Triplett, myself and Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| met on Thursday, March 28th at 4 p.m. and the committee had convened to review a nomination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5624)|
| 1:33:51| received to name the Carter Elementary School Cafeteria in honor of a KCS retired employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| Sandra Nell. Wait, is that the correct, no? Her name is Sandra Nell Holbert, Holbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5637)|
| 1:34:05| Sandra Nell Holbert, sorry. And a copy of the nomination is attached to the April 4th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| electronic agenda. After reviewing the nomination documentation and recommendation letters, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| as hearing from the Carter High School, I mean, elementary school administrator, who I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| plans on attending Thursday night, as well as the cafeteria manager, we voted unanimously to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5664)|
| 1:34:33| move forward with our recommendation to the full board for consideration of their approval of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| the nomination. It was a good meeting and it was especially nice to have the administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| and the cafeteria manager here and they had a lot of really inspiring things to say about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| Ms. Holbert. So, I am looking forward to them being here on Thursday, as well. I love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Christie. Just to give a little bit of insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| into our conversation, we talked about how we don't believe that any other cafeteria in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| school system has been formally named. We know that individual schools might stick a plaque up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| or whatever, but none of them have gone through the process and we thought even though this might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| cause precedent and maybe some other schools will opt to do this, we think that's a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| good thing. I mean, what better way to honor somebody who's given that much time to our food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| service than naming the cafeteria after them. So, I hope other schools kind of take that lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5726)|
| 1:35:33| and make suggestions because sometimes we're limited in the ways that we can honor people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| but I think that's a really appropriate way to honor folks like Sandra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| That's really cool. Looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| Moving on to, I don't think we have any public forum, right? Okay. Moving on to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| Celeste. I would just like to highlight this, in my opinion, amazing work of a student that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5751)|
| 1:35:59| is my friend. So, her name's Maya. She goes to Bearden High School. She's a senior and she has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5759)|
| 1:36:06| on her own, completely revamped what we all know as Powderpuff Football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| So, at Bearden, I believe it started about three years ago and this year has been renamed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5772)|
| 1:36:19| Girls Flag Football because the name Powderpuff is sexist because it refers to a women's makeup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5779)|
| 1:36:26| product. So, she did that all on her own, met with all the teachers that were involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| Girls Flag Football, and at the same time, revamped all the rules and made it more fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| So, last year, she coached her own team, did not have any football players coach her team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5800)|
| 1:36:47| and she won the whole tournament. And this year, she's doing the same thing, and I have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| privilege of being on her team this year, as well as last year. And our game is on Thursday, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5812)|
| 1:36:59| will not be here, but I will be updating you all on how it goes. So, thank you. Yes, please update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| us. It's a good reason to miss the meeting. Good luck with your game. Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| Miss Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to share that my greatest athletic injury was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| playing flag football. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. We're going to be on a roll here, Celeste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| so I wasn't planning on saying anything, but I have to tell you that Women's Flag Football gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| a lot more competitive at the collegiate level. My wife was on the team in college, and there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| not a game that they played that the opposing team didn't have somebody go to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| I'm just saying. Serious business. Wow. Mr. Triplett. With this conversation, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5859)|
| 1:37:46| canceling the meeting, and we're all going to the hospital. Yeah, exactly. And I want to come watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5866)|
| 1:37:54| Miss Pike. Thank you. I just want to highlight, it's April already, and while that's hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5874)|
| 1:38:03| believe, that does bring us to Autism Awareness Month, and so a little bit of history is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| Autism Awareness started in April of 1970. I was so surprised that that was that long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5890)|
| 1:38:17| but that in 2011, they moved to Autism Acceptance to kind of, as we learn things and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5897)|
| 1:38:26| bring us all up to date and make progress about things, but of course that's taken some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5906)|
| 1:38:33| so to read a little bit more information to you. I promise I will be brief. April is Autism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5913)|
| 1:38:41| Acceptance Month, but many, especially those outside of the autism community, used to refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5921)|
| 1:38:49| to the month as Autism Awareness Month. Autistic advocacy organizations have been using acceptance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| rather than awareness for over a decade, and the Autism Society of America shifted to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| terminology in 2021, so fairly recently, and some of you in here may have heard of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5939)|
| 1:39:10| saying of, if you've met one autistic person, you've met one autistic person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5950)|
| 1:39:16| That goes for many people and different. If you've met one woman, you've met one woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| and so on and so forth, so it's really hard to judge and stereotype people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| and so being in that community, I would just like to say that we're all a lot more brighter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| than stereotypes would have us all believe, and I would urge everyone to look at how we can all be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| a little bit more inclusive in our lives of autistic individuals. Thank you. Thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| that. Ms. Warren. Mr. Wright, welcome to your second month. Ms. Christie. All right, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5985)|
| 1:39:55| everybody get home safe. I know we're under a tornado warning or tornado watch currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| so please everybody get home safe, and with that, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240402?start=6000)|
