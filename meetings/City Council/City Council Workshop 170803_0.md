| 0:11:52| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=712)|
| 0:12:17| The next case that comes up is the State Supreme Court case of McAllen versus the City of Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=737)|
| 0:12:25| In McAllen, the Supreme Court discussed what they called a rational basis standard, whether or not the local legislative body, in this case it would be the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=745)|
| 0:12:39| had a rational basis in making its decision regarding the requested zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| And in many circumstances, unless something crazy went on, courts generally defer to the decisions made by your local legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=764)|
| 0:12:57| That's a very brief summation of that first thing entitled General Overview of Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=777)|
| 0:13:07| Now let's turn to generally the Nashville and Chattanooga short-term rental ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=787)|
| 0:13:15| Before you leave that first page, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Is it on? Is it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| It's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| You know, we're in an odd position here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| We have a set of zoning codes, and you've described both the process and the R1 exclusive residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| And now we're being asked to adopt an ordinance using a permit system that circumvents some of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=813)|
| 0:13:43| And it kind of makes you wonder, which is the top dog?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| I mean, can we undermine the zoning by ordinance so that we don't change the zoning code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| It's still in place, but we allow things like a hotel business and a residential zone by ordinance and permit instead of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=834)|
| 0:14:02| if we want that, let's change our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| And that's kind of the preference or priority system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| Yeah, as you'll see in what's being done in both Nashville and Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| they're saying that short-term rentals are being allowed in part of their code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| as Nashville has umpteen different residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| Chattanooga has a fewer number, but it's still saying in Chattanooga R1, R2, R3, and R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=867)|
| 0:14:36| They're going to allow them in there, and there's an application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| I'm not sure if I answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| I didn't draft the proposed city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| But the ordinance is kind of changing how the zoning law looks at the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| Well, yes, it's a permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| But you have to get permits in other zoning processes too, like the use on review type of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=898)|
| 0:15:07| You have to come in and apply for a use that's not automatically granted, which may be granted upon review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| All right, getting back to Nashville and Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| In general, I spoke to some very nice, very helpful people in both of those governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=920)|
| 0:15:30| The message that I heard from them was in both cities, it's not fully and finally settled in either city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=930)|
| 0:15:41| In Nashville, it looks like their first piece of legislation started back in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| Since that time, they've had 16 different pieces of legislation related to short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=948)|
| 0:15:56| Some of the things have been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| Some of the things have been postponed until October of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| Now, Nashville did have an ordinance in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| A husband and wife that was supported by the Beacon Center filed suit over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| and had a portion of that lawsuit thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| It dealt with, excuse me, a portion of that ordinance thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| It dealt with the definitions or lack of definitions for short-term rentals in the Metro Nashville Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=983)|
| 0:16:32| Nashville came back, added those definitions to that, and I'm not aware of subsequent litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=992)|
| 0:16:42| One of the things that the couple also sued about was a 3% cap on the number of Type 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1002)|
| 0:16:55| as they called them, permits that were in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| That was not thrown out by the judge over there, and that 3% cap exists as of today, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1020)|
| 0:17:09| In Chattanooga, excuse me, Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| Nashville also told me that they have recently appointed a city council committee to continue to look at their situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1034)|
| 0:17:26| In Chattanooga, their ordinance passed July 11th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| It's not going to be effective until October 1st of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| and the person with whom I spoke with down there did not think it was fully and finally settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1057)|
| 0:17:45| Now I'll briefly turn to the Chattanooga short-term rental ordinance and that handout that I've prepared for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1065)|
| 0:17:56| At the rear of this handout, as well as the one on Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1076)|
| 0:18:05| what I did, because the zoning code from city to city, town to town, county to county, varies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1085)|
| 0:18:15| I have shrunk down, edited what their different residential zones allow or don't allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1095)|
| 0:18:24| For example, Chattanooga has an R1, R2, R3, and an R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| and those are the zones that short-term rentals are allowed in the city of Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| and you can look in there to see what types of characteristics each of those zones have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| As in Knoxville, an R1 in Chattanooga and an R1 in Knoxville are the core residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1121)|
| 0:18:53| As you get higher in number, you go from R1 to R2, R2 to R3, R3 to R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| The level and intensity of use can increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| For example, an R4 is going to be more suited for a multifamily or an apartment or a large condo type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1144)|
| 0:19:15| Now in Chattanooga, their planning commission has defined a geographic area within which short-term rentals can be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1155)|
| 0:19:28| I do not know about the process they went through to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| but included with their ordinance is a copy of the map that has the district within which short-term rentals can be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1174)|
| 0:19:50| Inside those districts, they are only located, as I mentioned, within the R1 through the R4 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1190)|
| 0:19:59| Chattanooga, like Nashville, like is being proposed in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| has an application process and varying levels of information that you are to supply as part of the application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| and how the applications are reviewed by the local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| In Chattanooga, in my opinion, the application and the review process seems to be a little more stringent on non-owner-occupied applications for short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1219)|
| 0:20:37| That is not to say there are no standards on owner-occupied, but it looks like there is more to do if you want to have a non-owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1237)|
| 0:20:46| In the R1 and R2 districts in Chattanooga, you are not allowed to have more than five bedrooms per short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1246)|
| 0:20:56| In other residential zones, the R3 and the R4, you can have up to nine bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| As proposed in Knoxville, as you will see in Nashville, there are some concerns about life safety standards, meeting health and other zoning laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1264)|
| 0:21:16| and signage, whether or not you can have a sign on the property that indicates that here is a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1276)|
| 0:21:27| Chattanooga has a limitation on the number of people that can be put into a bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| Chattanooga puts the onus of collecting and remitting taxes on the host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| It lays out in here that if the host isn't present, someone's got to be able to respond to calls if there are trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1302)|
| 0:21:55| They recognize that there were some properties that were already operating as short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| They allow some grandfathering there for properties that are in the higher-use R3 and R4 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1322)|
| 0:22:15| They don't have to meet all the requirements that newer proposed short-term rentals have to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1335)|
| 0:22:26| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Yeah, thanks, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| You know, Chattanooga sat down and drew a map of where they wanted this activity to be allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| and that seems like a much more intelligent approach than just allowing it anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| I mean, they actually call their zone the short-term vacation rental district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1364)|
| 0:22:52| and they obviously circle their downtown, which has all the amenities along the waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| and they've got the aquarium and all those things down there, and they pick that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| I guess it's the Brainerd Road business area or shopping center area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| What would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| Probably it's northeast, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| But the map is included on the city council forum because I posted it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| But if you were looking at Knoxville and you said, well, where does it make some sense to have this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| why not say the UT area, whether that's Fort Sanders or on the campus side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| downtown because people come to our downtown to play and go to restaurants and shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| And there are some neighborhoods, and actually they're in my district, that like the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| They're split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| They're probably split everywhere on where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| But some of those, I'll call them homesteader neighborhoods with the real old houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| and people have to put a lot of money and sweat equity to bring them back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| and there are young couples that are looking for some extra bucks they can make doing this in those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| But you could draw a map, whether it's those or something else or the bike trail area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| and say that's an area where this is a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| but we're not going to destroy the zoning and the pleasure of living in a single-family residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| an area that you bought your house in and invested your hard-earned dollars in to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| and know your neighbors and not have strangers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Can we not draw a map here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| We have great mapping skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Well, you possibly could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| I mean, you're asking a question that, you know, it's a planning question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| which I defer to Mr. Green about that and, you know, drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| And it's also a policy question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| and I gave up policy-making decisions almost eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| So that's for the MPC and the council to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| But, you know, I do know that I did read some Times Free Press articles there about how some, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1496)|
| 0:25:06| the map was proposed and there were some little areas that I don't even think were contiguous to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| They were asking to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| And there were some areas that asked to be out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| You know, the whole process, whether it's here, Nashville, or Chattanooga, is ungainly in some regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1520)|
| 0:25:30| Everybody's trying their dead-level best, I'm sure, to try to make as many people as happy as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| but sometimes it doesn't happen, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| We're going to piss somebody off no matter what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| Any other questions to Rob or Matt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Nashville has a lot of different residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| They have 12 single-family residential districts, 10 one- and two-family residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1560)|
| 0:26:09| and 15 multifamily districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| So it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| So, but once again, on the bottom of the third page I tried to sum up the different residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1578)|
| 0:26:27| where short-term rentals are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| But what was interesting is that I obtained what I think has been all of the legislation that's been proposed in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1591)|
| 0:26:40| whether or not it was passed or withdrawn or deferred indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| And I summarized those on the last couple of pages so you can see what's been proposed over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| and didn't make it anywhere for one reason or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| But like I said, Nashville has been at this since 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| and a final vote on some of their proposals doesn't occur until October of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1627)|
| 0:27:17| Is that when that committee reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| I think the committee is a relatively recent creation councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| I didn't see a schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| They weren't tied together, the October date and the committee you've studied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| But in Nashville, a short-term rental is permitted as an accessory use in all zoning districts that allow residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1654)|
| 0:27:45| I didn't mention it for Chattanooga, succinctly, but in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| they can only be located in that district that Councilman Della Vope mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1671)|
| 0:27:59| Now, because of the litigation that was brought over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| Nashville has beefed up their definitions and added to them about what is a short-term rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| what is owner-occupied, and what is bed and breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| Nashville has three types of permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| A Type 1 permit is only for owner-occupied short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| and it seems to be the most restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| A Type 2 permit is for only non-owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| and it's available in those residential zones that are single-family, two-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1720)|
| 0:28:48| and then what they call non-conforming, multifamily units in single-family districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| So the limit that you hear in Nashville of the 3% in a census district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| it's for these Type 2 permits in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| And what that says is no more than 3% of the single-family or two-family residential units within each census tract can be Type 2 permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1748)|
| 0:29:19| If you go to Nashville's website, they have a search function where you can plug in an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| You type in the address, you do the search, and it will tell you within that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| it will give you how that census district is designated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| if there are presently any short-term rental permits that are available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| and if there are any open spots where somebody can come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| I couldn't get it to print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| I went and did the governor's mansion to see what that was like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| but he's actually located in the town of Oak Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| so this ordinance does not apply to the governor's mansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| but I put in a law firm in downtown Nashville that I was familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| and it said, for example, I think there were four permits outstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| and maybe one other one was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| So that's how they're addressing their Type 2 permits in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| How do you deal with equal protections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| There's 3% on this area, and the next guy says, well, why can't I get one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| Everyone else has one, or 3% has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| I don't know how they arrived at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| They did have legislation proposed that at one point they were going to say as little as 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| And that was challenged, that 3%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| It was in the lawsuit, but the judge did not get to that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| The judge said it was the lack of definitions that didn't allow the couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| to determine if they had a hotel, motel, or boarding house or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| Type 3 permits are for non-owner-occupied and multifamily apartments or condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1859)|
| 0:31:08| So that even allows the lessee of an apartment to, with permission of the landlord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| to lease out space in their apartment or condominium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| Then there's a listing of the required documentation someone must submit when they apply in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| It lists the different regulations and their other processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Rob, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| Moving right along with our agenda, before I introduce Jeannie, who we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| I just want to say that we have several members of the administration here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| We have Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| Can you hear me now, Dr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| We have Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| We have Jesse Mayshark, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I think Charles Swanson is hiding in the back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| I saw David walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| We have two former city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| We have Charlie Thomas and we have Carlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| So welcome to our meeting also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| So Jeannie is going to be our facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| All of us know Jeannie quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| She's been the one who's handled our retreats over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| and we appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| I also want to say that Jeannie doesn't have a dog in this fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| She lives in the county, so she is not going to be swayed one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| Right, Jeannie, on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jeannie Delaney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Angela, can you come on up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Until recently, I thought an SDR was some kind of missile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| so I don't really even know that much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| It's a virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| I appreciate council putting a little trust in me just to help them do their work tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| I don't have a great voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Well, you can't hear everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| No, I'll just yell out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| I'm really just here as a usual facilitator to help them stay on task and on time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| And what we're going to do is ask them to bullet point for us first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| and Angela's going to describe this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Some of the pros or positive aspects of SDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| And then we're going to get all those written up on flip chart paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| post them on the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| and then we'll move to concerns that they have about the whole concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| So it's a pretty simple format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| They want to come out tonight with some themes around both of those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| some sort of common pros, common concerns that they will then take forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| as they begin their discussions about moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| So, council, are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| By the way, this side can turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| We wanted to put those so that the audience could see the boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Yeah, you all can slide as you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| So who's willing to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| It makes this a more attractive town to come visit when you have the short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| I mean, I don't want to even say it's a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| I mean, it's here to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| And I think us, you know, opening up this type of lodging, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2070)|
| 0:34:39| I think it makes us, you know, more attractive for people to come here and stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| So it's economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| As a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| As a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| As a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| Improves tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Improves tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| Provides ways for people to make additional income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Additional income. Okay. Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| It also recognizes the reality of what's on the ground right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2110)|
| 0:35:20| I mean, we've got, what, 200 or 300 of these units in Knoxville already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| So this helps us to control and make sure that the safety issues are considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2126)|
| 0:35:35| It recognizes reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| And now you can begin to control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| Is recognized reality the same as capitulation to legal violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| Okay. I'm just wondering if that was equivalent. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| I don't answer lawyer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| I don't answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| What are some other positive pro aspects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| It does give control over what can happen with SDRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| In other words, we have a system or a process to go through for permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| and then controlling, knowing where these are and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Permitting and controlling. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Well, and I'll build on the comment that someone made about giving couples an opportunity to raise some funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| It's clear that there are homesteaders who buy older houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| and they need dollars to restore very old structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| And I understand that it's just not regular income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| but it's for them a chance to improve their households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| Okay. It can help with restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Restoration. That's a good word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| No, I think it also recognizes the reality of this sharing economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| which is probably throughout the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| As a matter of fact, throughout the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| It allows us essentially to continue to progress, as I think we have in the last 15 or 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| and be part of that sharing economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| That's a relatively new thing, but it's an old concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| It recognizes the sharing economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Does that mean they can't charge for people to stay at the house if they're just sharing as friends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| I think it's a private property right, and that's a con,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| that you're recognizing a person's right to rent their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| A private property right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| George, I'm sorry. What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| I didn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| It's a private property right, and that's a con,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| the pro is that that's a right that they have to rent their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| Private property right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| There's probably also, there's probably some income to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| It may be small, but with taxation there would be that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| not only in terms of the, I guess the hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| but also then the property or the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2290)|
| 0:38:22| Supports local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Supports local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| Kind of the idea is that these type of tourists would be more inclined to support neighborhood businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| They're not just looking to stay at Motel 6 and go to Applebee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| They might be trying to find more unique businesses in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| Nothing is wrong with Applebee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| That's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| Okay. How about our compatriots over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Any other thoughts we might have missed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| They pretty much covered the ones that I was thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| Particularly supporting local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| This does support local businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| and generally from my looking at those online businesses that do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| it's limited to a very specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| People are not going to go to very suburban Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| because they want to be closer to the things they've come to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| things they've come to see, places they want to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| And so it isn't as widespread perhaps as some would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| but it is a good support for local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| So, Brenda, how can we reword that for bullet points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| Is it bringing these visitors closer to amenities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| That's a good wording, but let's go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| Okay. So it brings people closer to amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| And let me dovetail off that in that I never miss an opportunity to promote the 1st District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| in that with the urban wilderness, I mean, that is a perfect example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| because people want to park their bikes in a garage and be on those trails in one minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| and they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| So staying in the outer banks of Knoxville doesn't lend itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| So you can, it all comes back to economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| but it's still, it can certainly highlight an asset that the city already has in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| And in many cases it's affordable, more affordable for a large group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| to be able to rent a house as opposed to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| Yeah, I'm not really supposed to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| but I am curious as a citizen in these other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| do they sort of know their market, people that might tend to use these more than others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| I haven't come across anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| They amended it 14 times in Nashville. I don't think they know it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2467)|
| 0:41:17| Another pro is that the companies, the online companies, and I'll pick Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| do screen people who want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| and they do have some requirements about being able to use their marketing capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| to advertise your short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| So you don't just fall off the turnip truck and decide we're going to do this tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| There is a process in place by those companies that have online presence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| which is the way to attract the occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| And they have a rating system too, and if you get low ratings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| people are not going to want to come back to your place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2521)|
| 0:42:32| He's 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| Are we missing anything? Positives, pros?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| All right, well, let's segue now to concerns, we'll call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| So if you want to title that, Ms. Andrews, and again, if you all are pleased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| you're doing great on the bullet point approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| A concern is enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| I didn't say that, someone else did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| I'm saying bringing businesses into exclusive residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| That's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| No, I did hear enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| I said enforcement before you started talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| Yes, bringing businesses into residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| Parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Number of people per household allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| Bachelor parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| Nick said noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Noise, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| I think he was saying animal house next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| No, I didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| I said the number of people allowed per house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| So that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| I think that there's a fear among some members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| because they really don't understand the Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| and some of the others that provide this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| And frequently when we're not real sure about something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| we can get very concerned and very protective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| So I really think that there is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I see this somewhat as a generational issue, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| that generally some younger people might be more inclined to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| although seniors are engaged in this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| But I think that this is a generational issue to some degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| on the divisions within our community about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| So my concern is that we need to figure out a way to get people talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| who will be affected by this, not just the nine of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| Okay, Brenda, I think I heard a couple of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| One is that it's a generational divide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| I think she said fear of the unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| I think a misunderstanding or lack of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| And that also segues into my point, and it's a very common one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| and that is the knowledge of the neighbors, the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| wherever the facility exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| So do the neighbors know about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Are they comfortable with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| Cohesiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| Well, there's been a concern that neighbors should be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| So a notification that if you're going to have an STR in your home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| you should notify your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Does that capture what you all three were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| Neighbor notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| Also the occupancy of the owner, especially in the proposed R1 or R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| So if the owner meets my presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| I'm not speaking into the microphone, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| You hear what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| In other words, as I think the Chattanooga ordinance said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| the owner had to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| I think that's what I recall Rod saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| And that's in our proposed ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| I think there's a concern of the erosion of an R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| of a single family residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| that is this the beginning of the erosion of the R1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| In other words, if we say that STRs are a business and a business is commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| then are we beginning to erode what the R1 is all about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2798)|
| 0:46:49| Hotel-like services without the same type of safety and oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| In other words, we have bed and breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| they have to be reviewed by different departments for safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| the fire and others, and all these other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| And when we get to places like Airbnbs and STRs we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| have a fire extinguisher and a carbon monoxide monitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| but we don't go in and check for sanitary conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| for safety, for all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Whereas regular hotels and places like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| have stricter enforcement on health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| So it's a lack of enforcement of health and safety requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| That's the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| Or what about just harm to hotels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| Harm to the business of a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| Because they're having to follow all those rules that Mr. Delvoppe just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2861)|
| 0:47:52| Jeannie, I don't know if this is a concern or a probe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| but I don't know that we've addressed or even talked about the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| if the short-term rental is commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| then should that commercial not be taxed according to commercial rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| as opposed to residential rates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Hotels are, businesses are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| You mean property taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Right, property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| In terms of how do we deal with that, for instance, on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| Well, I suppose I can add to the list of, we're still in cons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| the idea that you may be devaluing properties around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| If you start with a single-family residential community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| where everyone's sort of got the same thing and the same purpose and goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| and you start to bring in these hotel-like businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| you're going to have a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Are you making it harder to sell the house next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| or damaging the market value of your neighbor's residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| when he goes to sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| I mean, that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Lots of people have their life savings tied up in their house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| and all their energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| Very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2940)|
| 0:49:08| I know you all probably can't hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| I know you all probably can't hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| I think who's going to collect the taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| You know, if the taxes do, who's going to collect it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Airbnb under other rules, they propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| Well, that's a concern, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Yeah, but it may not be Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| It may be just a one-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| We're just stating concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Who collects the taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Who collects the taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| This may seem trivial, but, I mean, if you really begin to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| someone opening their house up for rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| I don't think there's anywhere that we talk about how many bathrooms are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| versus the number of bedrooms that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| And then a very simple thing is, what about garbage collection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| Are we going to, again, charge based on commercial rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| or are people going to be required to have two, three cans, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| That's right. Take it over to your dumpster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| Well, I guess we might as well throw in, if we haven't already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| I think we said enforcement, but the idea that the city may not have enough people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| to physically enforce a lot of small off-site businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| In other words, right now we're, I hate to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| but we're turning our back on 300 violators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| What's to say, if we have a permit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| that we're very vigilant about enforcing the requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| So you're going to have to come up with money and staffing to chase the rabbit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| and keep it sort of in the tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| So I guess it's the cost and personnel to actually enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| And I don't know how, the other side of that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| there's 300 people who've made that investment, substantial investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| So does that investment just dissolve? Does it go away? Do they lose that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| They still get the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| I'm not going to debate it with you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| I'm just saying it's a concern that I have, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| So the current STRs lose their investment. Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| Well, as Councilman Delavaux pointed out, and we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| there's those that are in business today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| And it is a concern of mine as to what happens to those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| that are up in business, to what happens to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| I think another concern is how are we going to notify the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| who are adjacent to an STR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| I think the way it's set up, I think in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| the city sends out, what is it, a notification to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| within 300 feet of wherever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| But I think the way I think ours is set up is that it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| the neighbors or neighborhood have to go to the city and find out who's who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| Chattanooga has one step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| If you look at Rob's summary, if the neighbors object,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| and I think they actually post a sign that it's coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| if the neighbors object, it goes to city council to resolve the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| There's actually an appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| So appeal by neighbors, I guess, or concerns of neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| Are we missing anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| The answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| I guess concern, it could turn neighbors against neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| sort of neighborhood harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| Well, and I'll add to that idea that we spend a lot of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| getting neighborhood associations together and watch groups and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| and their hallmark is they try to know who's supposed to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| and who isn't, and when there's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| they call it in to the police or someone else codes or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| But once you start bringing in strangers, no one knows that that's Joe's car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| I mean, they don't know who the people are that are in their own neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| so it becomes harder to be a watch group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3204)|
| 0:53:38| Is it all clear now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| Any more concerns, Marshall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| While y'all are thinking for a second, let Angela and I bring everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| and we'll put it on this wall, the concerns together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| the pros together, the concerns together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Then I want y'all to sort of look for some themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| Not that you won't have all of this, and I'm sure Will will tie it all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| Themes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| Just sort of consistent themes in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| I'm seeing that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| I'm going to narrow it somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| You want to narrow it somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| No, I don't want to get rid of anything important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| but if there are some sort of theme areas, like a source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| if there's a few that sort of…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| Like parking and traffic. Parking and traffic go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| Do we have that up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| We have parking. I don't know if we have traffic, roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| All right, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3270)|
| 0:54:39| What's that? You got the picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| The first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| So Dan's in Japan today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3288)|
| 0:55:06| You only had so many bullets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| One-armed paper hangers, that's one of our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3321)|
| 0:55:31| Okay, if y'all will take another look at these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| and Angela, if you'll be prepared, we'll put some pro themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| And if y'all don't want to narrow it that way, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| You didn't make it long with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3342)|
| 0:55:50| Well, I think economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| could encompass three or four of those right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| You could actually join that in tourism together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| That would be economic development tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| That's one category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Yeah, we have a lot around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| Jeannie, can you mark through the ones that we're putting together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| I don't think we'll need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| We'll come back, and she's going to re-describe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3375)|
| 0:56:31| How about enforcement is one big picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| Oh, we're in pros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3399)|
| 0:56:48| Overruled. It's a pro as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| So enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3413)|
| 0:57:05| Now, I see one around another chance for people for an income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| Either to use for their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| or just that separate from economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| Economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| Well, I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| We can't hear you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Yeah, I can't hear what they're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| but I think income generation within a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| is different to me than economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| To me, I mean, that's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| It's kind of macro and micro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| I mean, macro is helping the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| and then micro would be helping the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| But, I mean, you're on. I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| Hey, you all could move on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Yeah, thanks for putting us over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| No, you can move on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Did you design this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| He put us where he wanted us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| For a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| But you could get on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| Move over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Yeah, move over to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| As you look at this, I think you hit on three main themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| That things can fall under, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| And Will, if you will type it up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| So they've got their theme area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| and then what Blaine wanted was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| You know, like under economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| income, tourism, amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| that sort of falls there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| Is it separate, and is it a theme?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| You're saying headings with bullets under them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Is this a separate theme?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| I think it is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| I think private property rights is a theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| I don't want to leave anything out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| But it's not a grouping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| It's not enforcement or income for family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| All right, well, let's move to concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Jeannie, before you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| would you read through the pros?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| I'm too old to read those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Just read the list that's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| I'll come to a mic so people can maybe hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Is this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| Private property right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| These are the pros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Income to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Supports local businesses-tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| Brings people closer to amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Supports urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| More affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| People are screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Online companies and there are ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| Again, more pros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| Makes Knoxville a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| Improves tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Provides additional income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Recognizes reality slash a way to control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| Permitting and controlling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Can help with restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| Can recognize sharing economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| And then our current pro themes are economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| slash tourism, enforcement, income for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| I would agree with George that we need to include property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| on those pro themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Because some of these can kind of move around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| Well, I can't see it from over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| Yeah, property rights ought to be a theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| You said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| It didn't get written down yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Because additional income is sort of, I guess, a property right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Well, it touches on some other things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| Other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| So now let's segue to themes among the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| And I will call them out as well, if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3657)|

| 1:02:03| And traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| So what are your themes there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| That looks like it includes a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3732)|

| 1:02:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Do you want to make some bullet points on your enforcement then so you don't forget those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| Or just have Will put the bullet points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| You know, I don't know if you want to do it, but when you talk about enforcement, we're also talking about when you talk about traffic and parking and garbage, you're talking about infrastructure, you're talking about city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3762)|
| 1:02:54| It's kind of the nuisance part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3777)|

| 1:03:16| Any other concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| How about just the overall erosion of the R1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| I think erosion of zoning generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| So what do we have as themes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| The one that's jumping out at me is just sort of basic communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| You haven't put up devaluation either or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| That's a concern, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| That's not enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| That's not enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| That's a personal injury to the people in the neighborhood who have been affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| That damage to property values is a separate category that is one of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3836)|
| 1:04:07| Well, so is that it's going to bring people and they're all going to be happy and play here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| I mean, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Wake up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Let's get back to themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Do you all think a theme is communication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| It doesn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| I'm just throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Well, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| It works both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Yeah, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| It works from the neighborhood understanding who has it and also the whole permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3865)|
| 1:04:37| Taking it more from a complaint-driven system to a little more proactive system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| And I don't know if this is a theme or not, but what about the whole issue about taxation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| Where does that fall under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| Is that a theme?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| Minor nonsense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| We ain't doing it for the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Collecting it, paying it, charging it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| It's a theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| It's a theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Taxation is a theme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3909)|
| 1:05:25| Let me go back to PRO for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| Because I do think part of my job is to occasionally just probe you all a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| Is it a theme under PRO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| And it may not be, but it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| I mean, it's a phenomenon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| It's enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| It's already active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| That's a little different to me, but it's up to you all now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| It's lack of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| That's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| We have a codes department that lets people do things that are not lawful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| That's enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| Y'all had a couple of things about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| You recognize reality, and it recognizes a shared economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| For a front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| I agree, Gene, that this is a phenomenon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| A little bit louder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| Turn to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| This recognizes not just the reality in Knoxville, but the reality in our society, and actually worldwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| So this is a phenomenon that has been going on for some while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| It has arrived in Knoxville probably several years ago, and we didn't recognize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| We weren't watching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| I don't think there was too much upset about it, or we would have heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| So I think that is a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| And the theme is reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| It's stated in a bullet point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| What is that theme?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4005)|
| 1:06:53| Well, basically, it's recognizing what is on the ground right now in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| but this is a phenomenon that has occurred worldwide and pretty much led by the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4019)|
| 1:07:06| So it's an old concept that's just kind of revitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| That's that sharing economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| I think it's part of that idea that everyone wants progress, but we don't want change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| And if the change is going to occur in my neighborhood, then let's slow it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| But it is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| It has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| We have many nights that people have stayed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| There have been five complaints out of 8,000 nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| And so that strikes me that it's not a huge complaint issue that codes enforcement would be responding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4058)|
| 1:07:51| Well, now you're raising the question of do people call in their neighbors and start the police coming over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| and the codes people and start a pissing war with their neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| or do they just bite their lip and try to shut the windows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| Well, that's a part of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Do we want to have you address that in enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Do you want to have a system that allows for anonymous complaints to be driven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4088)|
| 1:08:16| Do you have a way to enforce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| And I think that's part of the reason you're putting it out there, so we can address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| It probably could be addressed in a more systematic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| And I've had several constituents who have called who have said that there's an STR next door to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| but they don't, just like what you're saying, Nick, they don't want to call it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Well, they have no problem complaining about long-term rentals complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| I mean, we have properties that are known that have a laundry list of codes enforcement that gets that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| But you have to understand that the property owner and the tenant have a lot of rights, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| So you can't just go throw somebody out because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| So there's give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| I mean, there's unrealistic expectations from neighbors that say that shouldn't be allowed when it's already a right to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4139)|
| 1:09:07| So there's a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| But could there be a better way to log those complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Could we have an enforcement that says too many complaints and it's not allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| So we can have, I think, enforcement is a really big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| I'm not arguing about the property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| What I'm saying is I'm just saying that, sure, there have been 200 to 300 short-term rentals in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| and that they say they've only had five complaints over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| What I'm saying is that some of the folks who have called me who know that it's next door, they don't want to get involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| in other words, what Nick's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| They don't want to cause a conflict between the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| Okay, so can we come up with a system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| No, I'm saying you can come up with a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| An enforcement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| Right, you can have an enforcement system where those could be lodged anonymously and not neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| hey, we have a complaint that this activity's going on, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| And I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| I don't think there's anything unreasonable about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| And, George, you might note in this national thing there's sort of a three strikes and you're out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| if you have three violations in a year that yank your permit or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| Right, so I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| And I think if it's defined and definitive and you have a system, then you can create that kind of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| If that's a con, which I think it is, which I would agree that it is, the lack of enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| then let's beef up the enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Well, I mean, part of the reality is we have laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| The police enforce laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| Short-term rentals do not change city laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| You can't just, it's not going to, if there's increased public drunkenness, parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| anything that might be a problem, noise, the law is still the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| So where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| Now that we have this catalog, we still haven't solved anything, so what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| I think Angela and I have completed our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| What she wanted us to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| Well, at least for now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| For now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| Just get the price response up, pose some concerns, and then find some themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| And then you're going to group the bullets under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| And then I guess Vice Mayor, it's up to you for the next steps with all the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| Right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| We're going to put it together for our next workshop next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| I have another question, though, and I don't know that this is necessarily pros or cons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| but we do have bed and breakfast allowed in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| And they're regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| And they're regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| And they're respected, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| So how does this STR ordinance relate to bed and breakfast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| In other words, if somebody does have a short-term rental and serves breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| do they then become a bed and breakfast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| What's the clear definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| National prohibits any food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| I think you've got to look at, you know, if permitting is an issue right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| if permitting is an issue and they have a stronger permitting for bed and breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| and we like that, then we're going to send that request to MPC for them to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| Obviously they're going to send it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| And we're going to craft part of an ordinance that can deal with it that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| we're going to come with those amendments that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| okay, we agree that there should be additional oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| and, you know, we should follow the permitting process of a bed and breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| I mean, that's our responsibility to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| And I think that's what we're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Rob's going to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| Bed and breakfast in the city of Knoxville is a use permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| so there's an additional step to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| It's not one of the automatic uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| And it is only allowed in your historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| and I think conservation overlay areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| So they have an extra step they have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| But if you look at the definition, it's very similar to the short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| I think the difference is just the market and how pervasive these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| You know, sort of what's happened with this technology is the barrier to entry has gotten so low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| Before, if you wanted to start a bed and breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| you'd have to answer the phone and do the booking, do the payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| You'd have to do all this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| Where now, Airbnb has dropped that barrier to entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| So you don't have to do any marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| You don't have to do any booking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| You don't have to answer the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| You just give them the key or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| And so that's why there's been this huge amount of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| But if you look at the definitions, they are pretty similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| I mean, in essence, all short-term rentals become bed and breakfasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| I mean, because are you saying the host of a short-term rental can't make breakfast for their guests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| I mean, are you going to regulate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| Can't in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| No food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| And I think that inhibits one of the real opportunities with these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| that it does provide some level of employment for limited employment for people, I think, is one of the positives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4453)|
| 1:14:23| But looking at it, you know, I think that's what's happened, and that's why it's a challenging issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4463)|
| 1:14:33| And when you read about it, the cities that have tried to outlaw it have had a very difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| Whatever has passed anywhere seemed like it's been very difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| From what I've heard in Nashville, sort of the stand-alone places, they have a real market for bachelor parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| And, you know, I'm not saying that for a joke, but it became a real nuisance in some neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| So I think a lot of these concerns are very real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| They stop at 9 o'clock and light the bench to party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| But I think the relation to bed and breakfast, I mean, Airbnb was originally called Airbed and Breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4502)|
| 1:15:10| You know, it was people that inflated air mats and cooked breakfast for people coming to a convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| So it's closely related, and, you know, it's difficult to predict how the trend will play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4516)|
| 1:15:25| But the more you read about it, there's cities all over the country are wrestling with exactly what we're wrestling with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4525)|
| 1:15:34| And, you know, I think it is going on, and it's our duty, in my opinion, you know, it is prohibited now, but there hadn't, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4534)|
| 1:15:44| since I've been on council, there hadn't, until we really brought this ordinance forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| there hadn't been a lot of outrage or I hadn't heard that people are, you know, renting rooms out of their home on a short-term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4548)|
| 1:15:57| So, you know, I think that's sort of where, why, you know, where we are in trying to, in the city, in the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4557)|
| 1:16:06| trying to create an ordinance to, you know, legalize this, permit it, have it taxed like a hotel, and deal with it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4566)|
| 1:16:15| So just some thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| Others? Thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| I would just like to, again, say that there is some merit to thinking about defining a district or district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4581)|
| 1:16:29| so that if it happens to be the center city in UT, or neighborhoods that border on them somehow, that want to be in, you could draw those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4589)|
| 1:16:38| If they want to be in South Knoxville around the urban wilderness, you could draw those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| You could have districts that have as their target market some form of tourism or use of amenities of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4603)|
| 1:16:52| as opposed to every subdivision and every residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| And we've had people come before us at council, and I know everyone here has probably gotten e-mails out the wazoo or phone calls about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4616)|
| 1:17:04| not in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| I mean, you know, there are people in the audience who said they bought a house and they've lived someplace 40 years and it's single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4626)|
| 1:17:13| and they like the sense of knowing who their neighbors are and that sense of belonging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| and they don't really want to be in the midst of commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| So if we choose a sort of a mapping approach, and that may not be the right word or even the right concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4642)|
| 1:17:29| we could start, and we're going to have iterations more than one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| we could start with an area that you would have to say is at least desirable to have this activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| as opposed to your concerns about R1 or R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| I mean, in other words, you could have areas where more people than not want that to be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| and find it healthy, income-producing, helps their restoration activity, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| But if we're going to allow it, we should start smaller and effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| and, you know, a few months later you'll know, gosh, now we can change this and add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| If we start letting it be everywhere, we're going to have to rein it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| And I think it's better to be permissive in small steps and learn as we go than just throw the doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4695)|
| 1:18:23| So I'm arguing for a moderated start if we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| Okay. Any other comments? Comments? Mark? Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| Jeannie, you have some work to do, and we'll get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| and we'll put this together and get it to council, and we'll put together an agenda for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| I do want to say to the audience, and especially the folks who showed up tonight, which, first of all, we really appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| if you have any additional concerns or pros that maybe we have not hit, if you would please send those to Will on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4734)|
| 1:19:03| we would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Give him an e-mail or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| My e-mail address is wjohnson at knoxvilletn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| Also, it might be good to point out the e-mail address for questions about ‑‑ what's that, Jesse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4753)|
| 1:19:20| You want to come up to the microphone, Jesse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| Yeah, it's strs at knoxvilletn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| And any e-mails that we get there, we'll make sure we forward them to Will to send to all of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| I will make one other point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| I believe Rob probably looked at Nashville and Chattanooga just because they're in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| but I believe Asheville, North Carolina, has the most comparable STR ordinance as to what Knoxville's proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4782)|
| 1:19:51| So it might be worthwhile to look at Asheville's regulations as a comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| You want to get us a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| Yeah, Rob will get that and put that together and send that to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| I would also like, if we're going to have a second workshop, and I think you've planned one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| let's have the enforcement team up here to tell us what they can do and can't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| and practical concerns because we're trying to anticipate that we're going to solve them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4813)|
| 1:20:20| but we don't really know what their capability is and what their concerns are about doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| And I would sure like to hear what they think will work for them as practical matters in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4824)|
| 1:20:32| I think that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Dr. Lines and I are going to be getting together, and we can talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| in terms of what you folks might like to interject for the next meeting that we have on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| Okay, the next one will be, again, at 530, and it will be at the service center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| What's that address? Public Works Complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| Go ahead and tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| It's at 3131 Morris Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Will that have a public forum at the end or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| It depends on what council elects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| Otherwise, we would do it the day that we have the meeting at council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| for referring this to MPC for their guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| I think we should have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| The thought was that we would have a public forum at the next one after we get finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| so we want to be sure to cover our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Well, I'm just thinking people will want to know who are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Are they going to have a chance to say their piece or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| Any other comments or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| Okay, we're adjourned again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Audience, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170803?start=4894)|
