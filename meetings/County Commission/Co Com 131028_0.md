| 0:06:32| because of the number of complaints in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| So we're on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| So I just want to pass that on to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| I mean, I wish you luck, but just because it has been turned over so many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| I'm aware of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=402)|

| 0:07:11| I'm just trying to figure out the logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Are you going to have people sit and drink the beer and then take a six-pack home with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| Is that the goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| I'm trying to figure out how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| I believe that's exactly how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| I mean, you know, that's something that I personally have trouble with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| I mean, if someone's coming for a drink, I'm great with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Going to buy a six, a 12, a 24-pack, I'm okay with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| But mixing those two, there's nothing we can do to stop that if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| I'm just giving you my personal point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| I think that's a dangerous mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| And it puts a lot of the onus and responsibility on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| And I'm hearing, you know, again, like Commissioner Smith said, with the turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| I don't know what the crowd is like, but, you know, that concerns me even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| But just, again, putting statements out there, that's something that is you've got yourself a nice ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=483)|
| 0:08:13| I say use it wisely and very, very responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Sir, you need to see the young lady in the back holding her hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| She has a package for you that might help you with some of these things that were just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Any other business to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| We're adjourned until 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| Okay, Commissioners, I'm going to go ahead and call the public forum to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| Madam Clerk, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=538)|

| 0:09:07| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=552)|

| 0:09:14| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=556)|

| 0:09:18| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| We're going to begin with honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| Madam Clerk, Commissioner Hammond, you want it read into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| I'll say a few words about jewelry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| And if Mr. Wilson, if you would join me at the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| This is a resolution honoring jewelry television upon the occasion of its 20th birthday celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| Need a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Commissioners, any time you have an opportunity to recognize a business that began kind of homegrown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| and has gained national prominence, it's an opportunity for us to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| and to recognize them for a job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| And today, it's an honor for me to present a resolution to Dennis Wilson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| who is the Chief Engineer of Jewelry Television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| As you know, Jewelry Television is located right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| But what you may not know is that they began in Greenville, Tennessee, 20 years ago this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| So they're celebrating their 20th anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| They relocated to Knoxville, and they continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| And it is astounding when you look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| They are now in over 80 million households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| And they sell just an extensive number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| I don't have the exact number, but it's in the millions of dollars of jewelry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| and gems and so forth out of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| And so they are not only in 80 million households, but here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| they have quite an economic impact because they have over 1,500 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| They are one of Knox County's largest employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| So on their 20th anniversary today, we wanted to take just a moment to recognize Jewelry Television,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| all of their management, and all of their employees to say thank you for staying in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| and for growing this business into national prominence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| And any time you can go into 80 million homes from Knox County, I think that's a pretty good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| So, Mr. Wilson, again, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| And say thank you to all the folks at Jewelry Television on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Thank you. And I'd like to say it's an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| And thank you to Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| I need to take a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Is there anyone here for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| We had no one sign up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Is anybody here for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| You want to come down to the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=704)|
| 0:12:01| Sir, you have the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Are you coming on a specific agenda item or do you want to speak at the agenda item time or do you want to speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| Either way, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| I would just wait until at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| We're going to adjourn until 2 o'clock and then we'll set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=742)|
| 0:12:32| Go ahead and call the meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Well, we're going to kind of change the agenda, but what I want to do is have the roll call, the devotional, the pledge to the flag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=755)|
| 0:12:46| and then we're going to move the discussion item in regards to criminal clerk's office to the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| and we'll dispense with that and then move on with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| So, Madam Clerk, if you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=777)|

| 0:13:06| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=790)|

| 0:13:15| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Commissioner Owenby, if you would, the devotional, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Everyone please bow their heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Dear Lord, we come to you today thanking you for allowing us another day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| and also asking you to give us the wisdom to look at everything with an open mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| and not be judgmental and that we take everything into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| that we make the best decisions that's best suited for this county and for the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| And Commissioner McKenzie has the pledge to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| Let's all stand and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=836)|
| 0:14:18| Okay, without objection, I need to add the discussion item to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| Is there any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Okay, earlier this week I asked Ms. McCroskey if she would like to give the opportunity to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| in light of the discussion that occurred last week to address the commission, and she chose to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| And so what I would like to do is ask Ms. McCroskey to come and to give her statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| to give her information that she would like to present to us as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| But I do want to remind you we're limited as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| We're very limited in our powers over this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| It's a separately elected office, and I want you to understand that we are a part of the Justice Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| and also the Audit Committee, and so those discussions can occur later in other arenas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| But I don't want today to turn into something that it should not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| So, Ms. McCroskey, if you'd like to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=909)|
| 0:15:19| Joy McCroskey, Criminal Court Clerk, Room 149, City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| I just have a few statements and comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| First, I want to apologize about last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| I had no idea anybody needed to see me, and then when I talked with purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| they told me you'd moved my collection item to the consent agenda for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| So that's when I left, so I do apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Thank you for inviting me, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| I'm happy to have this opportunity to separate fact from fiction concerning recent allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| about the offices of Knox County Criminal and General Sessions Courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| I served nine courts, three in criminal court, five in General Sessions, and one in Fourth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=966)|
| 0:16:14| And the vast majority of these allegations come from one of those courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=974)|

| 0:16:26| The allegations are contained in interoffice emails written by an assistant district attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| and were never provided to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| I have prepared a response today to those emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| I went to the law director and got, I called and asked him about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| and he said he had been sent a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| He was gracious enough to give me a copy of his emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| That's all I have to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| It needs to be stated that last year alone, we handled about 70,000 cases in criminal and Sessions courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1017)|
| 0:17:06| On average, we handle more than 75,000 cases a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| I would like to point out that we have had problems in far less than 1% of those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1032)|
| 0:17:22| We strive for professionalism in all courts, but mistakes unfortunately happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1042)|
| 0:17:31| I apologize for my mistakes, any that my offices have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| Based on the allegations I have received on several defendants being arrested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| I'm providing you with copies, and I think you all have a copy of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| of my response and the records from the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| Based on the allegations made, I find no fault with the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| I found one mistake that the clerk's office made in failing to issue a release on a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1079)|
| 0:18:08| There's still a question as to whether another county wanted him or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| but we should have done a release for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| I will be glad to talk to each and every one of you once you've reviewed this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| so therefore I won't be taking questions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| In closing, I would just like to say that for me, the clerk's office is not just a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1108)|
| 0:18:36| Even though I am now the elected clerk, the work of that office has been my life's work for 45 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1116)|
| 0:18:47| and I'm proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| I feel very fortunate to be a public servant in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| I am very proud of the employees in the offices and the good work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1135)|

| 0:19:05| Thank you, Mr. McCroskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| I think it would be prudent if the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| and it appears that we're going to do such at the law director's behest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| to not discuss these individual cases publicly until they've all been reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| and he feels more comfortable with where we are at and the Justice Committee can have those discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| as to where in the process some of these fixes need to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| There's many partners in that process, and we'll continue to work for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| So, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Can I add one thing to what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1181)|

| 0:19:45| Oh, no, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| That's totally up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| I'm asking the commission not to have a large public debate without all the facts right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| And if I receive anything else, I will investigate that and give you a full report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1198)|

| 0:31:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1871)|
| 0:31:22| We're back to page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Resolution 112 is appointing two individuals to serve on the Knox County Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1884)|

| 0:31:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| We have the list of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| I think there was one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| I'm sorry, I don't remember the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| The e-mail that we got a few days ago that wanted to, who was it, number 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| Mr. Smartwood, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Smartwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| I'm sorry, Smartwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| Is there anybody else that's here for the ethics appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Mr. Smartwood was not here, so if we could give him a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| Is that okay with the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Mr. Smartwood, the name, address, and less than five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| I won't take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| My name is Garrett Smartwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| I live at 1311 Copperstone Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| I've been here in Knoxville for about 12 years, a little over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| I'm happy to say that I chose to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| I had an opportunity to live in different areas of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| I was living at that time in Wilmington, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| My wife and I literally made a spreadsheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| and looked at the pros and cons of this area compared to other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| from economic circumstances to the environment, to the climate, to the beautiful countryside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| to the wonderful people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| And we decided to come here to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| And in this time I've been an attorney practicing law here with the law firm of Long Ragsdale and Waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| I do commercial litigation, which is representing businesses and property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| I come here to the city county building once a week or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| and in the old courthouse for General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| So I want to make the point that I've made Knoxville my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| and I've established a practice of law here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| And at this point I want to give back and I want to contribute to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| And I think I'm particularly well-suited for this particular committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| I spent some time in the United States Marine Corps as an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| I was an attorney in the Marines before I came here and, in fact, did investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| I was involved in what they call JAGVAN investigations over ethics violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| and sexual harassment and other sort of things and reporting those things to commanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| So I think I've got some experience in the sort of things that the Ethics Committee is intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| I'm very interested in trying to become more involved in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| and I think I'm well-suited for this particular committee in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| Any questions of Mr. Swartwood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Sir, did you have an opportunity to speak last week, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| We need to ask does he have employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| The gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Mr. Swartwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Do you have any family members that are employees of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| I'm married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| My wife stays at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| I've got three children, but no family members that are employed at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Yes, and I'd ask the other candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| What's your overall view of the reach of the Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| What's your general philosophy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| What should the Ethics Committee be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Should they look at, you know, every complaint call that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| or should they look at higher level, you know, 50,000 foot type agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| So what's somewhere in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I just want to give you an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| And I'm not sure how the Ethics Committee necessarily has been operating up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| but my opinion is they should look at every complaint that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| but provide more time and more effort and energy to those that appear more serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| You know, I see the Ethics Committee as an advisory role in reporting to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2120)|
| 0:35:28| and I think every complaint that comes in ought to be given some attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| And with those complaints that seem to be more of a serious nature, be given more additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Okay, what we'll do now is we'll take these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| I believe we have two appointments on this resolution, so we'll take the first appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| And we'll take nominations starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Just since we've got two appointments here, if we go through the process the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| and we make our first appointment, will we go back again and look for nominations again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| We'll treat them all each as individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2168)|

| 0:44:03| So I need a motion and a second to approve these two names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2643)|

| 0:44:28| which term expires October 31, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| And we'll do this in the same fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| We'll start in the first district taking nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2676)|

| 0:44:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Would we be out of line appointing one of these two to fill that slot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2682)|
| 0:44:51| After the vote's already been announced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| The original appointment resolution has been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| So this is they can't serve two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| And they're already in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Both these gentlemen have been appointed by this body now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| The only way to undo it is prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| Two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2715)|

| 0:46:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Mr. Smartwood or Swartwood, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| Mr. Burleson, thank you guys for being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| The next item is resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| It's listed on page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| It's determining the method of disposal of property located at 101 East 5th Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| also known as the historic Knoxville High School, to be through the request for proposals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2817)|

| 0:46:59| The motion being to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Determining the method of disposal is RFP, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| I'll make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| I'm not going to make a big brouhaha over this, but I'm just wondering, you know, this seems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2839)|
| 0:47:26| I know we're trying to curate something that we didn't check all the boxes on, but is this appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2846)|
| 0:47:35| Is this, I don't want to use that bad word, legal, but is this okay to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| We've already had a RFP, and I know we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| That would be the method, but is this something that we can legally do once we've already gone through an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| is to approve that we use an RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| It's just kind of weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| The purchasing department basically was given approval and was supposed to prepare a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2883)|
| 0:48:12| They failed to do that, and we're trying to come back to make it correct based on what the directive they got from this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| I think, back in July or something when all this was going on, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| I'm trying to recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| But, yes, the code says that you shall approve the method of disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| You can approve it at any time you want to as long as you approve it or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| So it's up to this body to approve it and then determine, you know, later was the process proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| In so doing, if you pick a particular method of disposal, once that is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| then as long as it is followed procedurally, then it becomes administerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| If it is not followed procedurally, you know, if there's fraudulent or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| then you all have decisions to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| But as far as being able to, you can approve the type of disposal at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| You know, and I guess with that said, I'm just wondering, should we defer this for 30 days as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| I think that's what we did, defer it to November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| And I guess my concern is, and it's just a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| I hadn't really talked with purchasing or anything like that to get any details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| I plan on doing that with this other piece that we did defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| And that's, was the losing bid, I'm assuming there's just two bidders because there are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| So was the Dewhurst folks, let's call them by name there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| were they allowed to fully resubmit once they, you know, was that bid that they submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2988)|
| 0:49:57| I kind of liked it in terms of, you know, bringing teachers into this part of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| was that considered non-responsive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| So go back and, you know, resubmit with something with a little more, you know, in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| So, again, so I guess I'm just wondering, so is this something to, and I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| if you want to answer that, Hugh, that's fine, yeah, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| But I guess I'm just trying to, you know, do we keep these two lumped together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| or do we separate them is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| It's just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Thanks, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| This is 1,000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| They weren't allowed to go back and change their bid after they'd already submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| It's sort of like the horse has done left the barn kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| And what the proposal asked them is, what will you pay the county for this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| It's not who will you subsidize, what special interest will you subsidize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| It was what will you pay the county for this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| I'm just, you know, it's the other end of it is you'll, the seniors is a good safe bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| And I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| I'm not, you know, I don't know why I'm going to vote next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| But, you know, in terms of trying to bring younger folks, people with family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| into, you know, a building like that, I do think it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| something you're going to have to get creative with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| So, again, it's not saying that the one proposal is over the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| But, you know, if we can kind of ask folks to think outside the box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| what's going to best serve Knox County, what's going to get the best bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| I understand they didn't specifically answer the question with a dollar figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| But, you know, it was something that when I read it, I said, okay, that's not the worst idea in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3111)|
| 0:52:00| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| Commissioner McKenzie and I are in private conversation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| This particular thing that's before us right now is just how we're going to gauge how we're going to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| So if you'd like to, I think what we've got before us is would you like that to be reworded to sell by auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| or sell by this or sell by agent or are we going to sell it by request for proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3153)|
| 0:52:41| That's all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| And now we're both looking at the law director and saying, is that what's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| We're just curing something and it has nothing really to do with the sale or transfer of the real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| I'm just trying to make sure you and I get on the same page about what it is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| Yeah, but I guess I was saying we as a commission could put some hooks in this RFP to say that best serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| and fully utilizes all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| put some orders into where maybe they would have gotten a different set of instructions based on our type of RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| You know, so I think we were at liberty to do things just not just the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| But that's what he does for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| And like you said, in the previous agenda item, I mean, we've always agreed with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| But, you know, if we were interested in doing something a little more exotic, a little more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| radical in terms of what we're going to do to vitalize that part of the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| we could have done that through the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| And I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| I sort of follow that argument or that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| Would you like to change this or are we just going to set where we are and then because what's before us next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3231)|
| 0:54:02| And excuse me for just a second, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| We're going to we still have to look at 803, right, to vote to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| It was deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Today's the voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| So we're still going to look at 803 in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| I just want to make sure that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| If it's deferred in a workshop with a consent, it's deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Then I'm off track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| The thing that's before us right now is if we need to reword this, we're at the discussion phase of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| And we could defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| And that's what I'm sitting thinking of a substitute, whether I want to go with a substitute motion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| But that's something that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| That's exactly why I wanted to have this discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Any changes that we might make other than what Hugh has already put out would possibly negate the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3300)|
| 0:55:10| But being said, and Hugh mentioned this last Monday, this body has not had the chance to discuss what the possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3310)|
| 0:55:18| or proposed uses might be for that particular building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| We're not talking about an average run-of-the-mill building here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| We're talking about a building that's got some history, and it needs to be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| What is the best use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| It's a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| We've been looking for a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| We've talked about it for the five years that I've been sitting in this chair about a place to put the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| Why do we not move the school board to that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| We need the A.J. building over there to put back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| That's several million dollars, not $500,000 like this piece is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| Why do we not have some kind of discussion and see what we can come up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| It may be that we jumped a little early on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| I'm not faulting Hugh, but I'm just saying that this body never had a chance to discuss what might be the best use of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3366)|
| 0:56:14| I'm not fully convinced that what is being proposed is a total base use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3374)|
| 0:56:22| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Hugh and Mr. Law Director, help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| And, Hugh, I've got a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| As I understand it where we are right now with this, we did not vote on the method of disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| So an RFP was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| An RFP has been awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| But yet we did not approve the method of disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| So in my feeble mind here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| help me understand that the proposals that are out there right now are null and void until we approve the method of disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3406)|
| 0:56:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| The proposals that are out there right now have not been approved by a vote of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| If you change the method of disposal, that will affect what is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| As it stands now, because we did not approve a method of disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| what is on the table right now is basically until we approve the method of disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| We don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| And so, Hugh, if you would kind of take us through the process and how this was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| and just the thought process behind it and the people who came together to approve this RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3443)|
| 0:57:30| I'm just interested in all of the semantics of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| It's just our standard approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| We put a team together of subject matter experts, people who had ownership not only in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| but actually in the process, in the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| You know, I could go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| I could name the people on the committee, if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| I really don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| But in evaluating these two, I understand that the bidding was close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| And there were three proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| And when we put the document together itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| we used a lot of the work that the East Tennessee Design Center had done for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| and the three public meetings that were held regarding the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| That document is basically a compilation of all those things put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| And it's including feedback from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| So I guess the question then is what happened that we were not, that we didn't vote on this up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3503)|
| 0:58:33| Like I said last Monday, that was my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| I thought that that had been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| There was obviously a meeting in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| I was somewhat given an indirect directive of, you know, RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| But, again, I assumed that one of my employees had done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| They didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| That's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| At the end of the day, the buck stops with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| But I really think that the document that we issued was of a quality nature RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3538)|
| 0:59:09| I think it asked all the right questions to get us to a proposal that would be acceptable for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3549)|
| 0:59:19| So from your standpoint, if we take this and revise it, I'm talking about the method of disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| theoretically you would have to go back and issue another RFP if we change it substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| In other words, we say, in other words, I'm trying to figure out here where we are in terms of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| If you came back and said, no, I don't want senior living, no, I don't want mixed use, no, I don't want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| I think we listed four or five acceptable uses, yes, we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| Or if you told me to sell it by public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| But we were very broad in what were acceptable uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| We stayed focused on what the design center study said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| Senior living, obviously, is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| But, yeah, if you turned around and said sell it by sealed bid or public auction, you might have an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| You know, again, I just think, like Commissioner Brown said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| I think this isn't your standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| It sounded like a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Standard process was done with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| But I think we're dealing with a nonstandard facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| I mean, its setting is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| Its history is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| I just wonder, you know, I don't want to be looking back five, ten, fifteen years down the road and saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| that really, with that interstate view, with all the positives of that building and that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| and just the history around it, it just, you know, I just wonder, did we give Hugh enough ammo to go forward to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3649)|
| 1:00:57| for the people to get kind of creative with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| So maybe we did, maybe we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| But what I'm going to do is introduce a substitute motion that we just defer this until the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| It's going to be before the issue that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| We have no harm, no foul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| We can go back and look and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| We can spend this next month thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| I'm sure there will be some interest if this does pass, you know, and we may get something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| So just to consider deferring this until the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| So that's going to be my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Now we'll speak to the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Do you have toward the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Well, I had a question for Hugh in regards to this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| I mean, in general, the fact that you mentioned a while ago that there were some public meetings held before this RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3707)|
| 1:01:57| or during the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| Yeah, the East Tennessee Design Center, they held three different meetings to engage the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3719)|
| 1:02:09| Were they noticed to the residents in the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| It's my understanding that they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Yeah, I guess you could talk to David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| Well, based on the turnout, I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| I am surprised because of all of the negative input that we got after the fact from the neighbors in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3740)|
| 1:02:32| and no positive input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| At least it didn't come to my email anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| But everything was negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| And I was wondering if these people were at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| and did they understand what was happening and what we were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| Well, and I will say this, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| Sometimes, you know, a process works the way it's supposed to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| and sometimes it doesn't have the end result that everybody likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| And it can be unpopular with a minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| But, again, I think what you have with Family Pride in Southeastern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| is a group that's going to do a quality rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| They understand the historic significance of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| And they've got a developer involved who has done several of these type projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3798)|
| 1:03:25| especially in the school area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| I just want you to know that I don't think we'll have any issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| with the award that the purchasing department has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| Well, I don't have any problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| I don't know who Chris is using on this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| but I know that they did a fantastic job with the Flanagan School out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| So, I mean, I know I've seen his work, and I've been in there for several meetings since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3826)|
| 1:03:53| But my main concern is here are we looking at what is the best overall use for that particular building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| since it is such a historic place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| And from my perspective, I would defer to the committee because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| those are people who have ownership in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| They bring a special area of expertise when it comes to development and rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| and historic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| So, again, I defer to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| I think they did an excellent job, and it was a well-vetted process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| If I'm going to support deferring 803, I don't see an issue in not supporting deferral of 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3873)|
| 1:04:41| And let me just throw out, we're talking about 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| I think in reality it's 21 because we've got to shorten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| so it's going to pass real quick for the public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| Mr. Dover, I think, is talking about some meetings, so it's going to be fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Back to readdressing the community meetings, I attended one of the meetings at a church on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| so I know that there were community meetings and there were several people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| and they had nice cookies and punch and desserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| So throw some food out and I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| The thing that I'm somewhat in a dilemma over, though, is that even if it's just 10 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3917)|
| 1:05:26| what are we looking toward happening during this period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| Are we going to change the method of disposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| And are we going to dictate a more strict use of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| And that's what I was hoping that we might hear a little bit more about today because it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3937)|
| 1:05:45| it's not really a dilemma with the people that live in Corrington, Rita or Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| but I do want to try to help do what's the best thing for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| And saying it might be a good location for the Board of Education, that might be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| Saying it's a good location for something that is more upscale or higher income residences, that might be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3961)|
| 1:06:11| But I think we need some discussion about what it is that we're looking for getting to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3971)|
| 1:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Yeah, I just wanted to make a couple of comments because I think I attended a total of three of those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| and either you can correct me or if there's anyone else out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| The way the process started is that they asked the design center to look what would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| and appropriate uses for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| And they came up with several things that would be appropriate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| There was a mixed use where it was mixed commercial, mixed residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| One of the others they came up with was senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| And this is not supported housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| It's not a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| It's just basically an apartment building for the housing where people would be there the time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| They came up with some other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| I don't believe that any of those that the design center came up with dealt with having the school board there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| or any of those, did they or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| Or was that one that even came up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| And I'll tell you why I don't think it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| It's what the neighborhood is looking for is they would like to have a place where there's activity even at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| not just a nine to five, because they call that a dead area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| You know, it's across from the Greyhound bus station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| You have the interstate crossing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| You have those parking lots underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| And I think that the reason the design center came up with what they felt were appropriate uses was to have people there 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| hours a day so there would be activity there 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| And you're talking about receiving, you know, a lot of letters or e-mails against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| and I've received the same ones you do because usually they're cc'd to all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| is some of the business people in that area would prefer to see a mixed use where you do have some businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4073)|
| 1:08:01| maybe restaurants, small shops, in addition to having housing there for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| And that's the mixed use proposal that Mr. Dewhurst came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| On the other hand, the proposal that won dealt with seniors being there where you still would have people up and around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| These aren't incapacitated people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| These are people that are completely independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| There's no nurse to take care of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| They drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Yeah, they could drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| They're trying to keep them from driving, but these are people that can get up and walk around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| They're just, you know, they're just people who aren't working anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| And, you know, that's what the discussion over is what's the best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| And my understanding is that when it went through the RFP process when they weighed all of this on the issues that dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| with the use of the building is that the Dewhurst proposal was more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| But he essentially said, we want you to give this building to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| I mean, to the county to give him at no cost, you know, no cost to him, just to give him the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| And then what he would do over the course of five years or six years is that he would give a 20 percent discount to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4146)|
| 1:09:14| Knox County teachers that wanted to live in the residential part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| And it really wasn't even all the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| I think he.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Forty units out of 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| He had 40 units that he would set back to say, I'll give it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| I'll give a 20 percent discount on the rent if teachers come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| But he wanted Knox County to give the property to him, whereas the proposal from Family Pride was for 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4169)|
| 1:09:37| He says, I'll pay the county $500,000 for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| But the controversy dealt with, you know, what's the best use, excluding what the county is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| But the two points I wanted to make was is that, one, is that when the design center looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| to have this as a nine to five building and then the rest of the time it was a dark and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| an abandoned building was not on their list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| And I think that's, you know, that's why the part with the school board didn't come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Because the, you know, the community, the businesses, they wanted something else there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| They wanted people there where it would be literally a 24-hour a day occupied area, you know, with people coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| And I think I summed that up fairly accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| And I will say to that, commissioners, that we had an appraisal done on that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| And there was senior independent living was given the highest and best use mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4227)|
| 1:10:36| There's a seven to one need in that community for that kind of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| And that's information I think that all of you all need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| And it's part of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| The appraisal is attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| I just wanted to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| And if you noticed, I haven't taken sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| I'm just saying, you know, that's what the process has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| Commissioner, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Commissioner Bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| So as this discussion then moves along, what we have before us is a question of commission, not about the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4263)|
| 1:11:15| Then we're beginning to deal with what's best for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4275)|
| 1:11:23| Dr. Briggs was doing this just a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| So I guess what I'm doing when I mimic him is to say it's $500,000 in one hand and $0 in the other hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4285)|
| 1:11:34| So if that's true, then it may take a lot of explosive to move me from one hand to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4294)|
| 1:11:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| What we have, the motion on the floor, is to defer until the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Let's do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4315)|
| 1:12:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4325)|

| 1:12:08| Commissioner Owenby votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Commissioner Briggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Commissioner Brown votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Commissioner Hammond votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Commissioner Shouse votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4349)|
| 1:12:40| Four ayes, five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| We're back to the original motion that you had before you determined the method of disposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| as the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| Will we have a chance to, once this project gets underway, to review what types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| are going in there at that point with any suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| The understanding that I have from the law director is that if we change the RFP is out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| There's three proposals, two that are very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| If we change anything in the RFP, we open ourselves up to the winning bid as a litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4398)|
| 1:13:28| If we change, we could change it to auction, but then we could have the school that we have in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4408)|
| 1:13:35| that's been auctioned and empty and fallen down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| And so I think our, correct me if I'm wrong, if we change anything, if we keep it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| if we want to enhance the RFP, we open ourselves up as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| If you have a material change, then we're back at base one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| And what we have here, and I'm not judging the procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| but according to Commissioner Briggs' presentation of the procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| what you have to look at is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| If you approve a method and the method is reasonable and fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| and it is not fraudulent and it is not improper in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| then the vote to approve is kind of ministerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| It's if it is fraudulent and improper in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| then it's when commission steps in at the final say and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| we can't accept this and here are our reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| But once, you know, it's kind of like I look at it like the Olympic Games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| Once the person's won the gold medal, unless they won it improper or unfair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| you don't take the medal away and give it to the second or third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| If you reject this method of disposal and you reject the current bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4480)|
| 1:14:48| it doesn't go to second place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| It doesn't go to third place, I think, which is the Dewhurst party is in third place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Second place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Then it goes away and you have to start all over again for whatever you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| So if you have a material change, then we're back at base one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| I think I'm going to be correct in saying that I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| But I don't think it's just an administrative exercise for us to approve this if we go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| But I think that what we can do is when any of these RFP bids become before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| we vote them up or we vote them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| And then if we vote it down, then the process starts all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| Let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Let's say that there was an RFP and the two RFPs were to give the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| I mean, these are the only two people that do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| To give the schools to people who really have no experience in developing, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| But they are the only two people that have come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| We can still, I mean, we have the right to turn those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| We're not obligated to take a bad bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| What I'm saying is, though, if you approve a process and you follow the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| and it's done correctly, unless you find a better use that the county needs it for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| then you're generally, I mean, these people have put in consideration for that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4569)|
| 1:16:17| I don't want to get too far out on a limb what I'm talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| but generally it becomes more ministerial than it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| This decision needs to be made on the front end, whether you're going to negotiate and sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| how the RFP is, what your parameters are going to be and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| So where we find ourselves today is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| Operating under an unauthorized RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| We have before you a method to dispose in an unusual situation, but the pleasure is at this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4600)|
| 1:16:49| No, I was actually looking down because you really have to answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| I don't think that after the fact that we can put conditions on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| If we really don't like what happened, we can just, I think we can just say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| And then the process has to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| In other words, we can reject the, you know, what the bid was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| That's why it comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| But you've got two different things here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| We're authorizing number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| The only thing we can do today is up or down on the RFP, whether we're going to authorize it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| But once that is done, before, I mean, there's going to be meetings between now and the time that this number two comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| And before that vote is taken, we can ask that certain changes be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| And if the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| I would say only to the winning bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| Well, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| And if they don't agree to that, those changes, then we can vote it down and have to re-bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| I think we could probably put some deed restrictions, because I know there's been some concern that if we approve it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| that in a few years the family pride could sell that to somebody else where they put Section 8 housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4678)|
| 1:18:06| or maybe something in there that the neighborhood doesn't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| I think we can put deed restrictions into it so that it would essentially in perpetuity say you can't do certain things to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4689)|
| 1:18:16| Now, that's part of the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| But I'm not sure that we ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| I mean, you know, the rest of it was in the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| We could ask them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| And they may very well agree to it as a condition for us accepting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| But I don't think we can ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| Where they've won the bid on making this senior housing, I don't think we can go back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| well, we want restaurants and we want shops and we want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| I mean, they ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| You're exactly right, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| And I do know from talking to Family Pride in Southeastern that their plan is to engage the community through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| as well as this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| And you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| We have already been talking about those very deed restrictions for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| You know, I guess that was really my point on trying to defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| Again, we wouldn't have ---- I'm not voting up or down on Dewhurst or Family Pride, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| so please don't think I'm biased one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| But if we would have deferred this for 30 days, we could have entertained both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| At this point, all we can do is vote them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| But if we didn't entertain the process, if we said, no, we never approved the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| or we deferred that question, we could have let this 21 days pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| and then we would have had kind of a fresh start on what we wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| So that was my point, not to necessarily say no, because it may be a certain aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| It may be, you know, this deed restriction may be considered minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| but there may be another bigger tweak that we wanted to make that may make this thing not agree to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4792)|
| 1:20:00| and then we have to start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| Whereas if we didn't approve the process, I think we would have been in a better situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| to maybe just add some things and have a rebid on a limited basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| But that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| But I'll still say we're not done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4814)|
| 1:20:21| Again, we're not passing judgment on any proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| That's not what this resolution is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| This resolution has nothing to do with the words that these companies submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| This resolution is about our process, and we own that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| So, you know, folks say, I like this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| It sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| It's got the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| It's board education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Forget about all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| This is only talking about our internal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| So I'll say, you know, I'm going to vote against this in hopes that we can bring it up again next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4849)|
| 1:20:57| with the conversation about the prior to the conversation about what we're going to do with the proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| that we have in hand that aren't officially ours yet because we didn't approve the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| I hope folks understand why I'm doing what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| And I think it will give us more flexibility next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4874)|
| 1:21:23| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Mr. Chairman, we're getting into some legal things here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| and I want to just make sure I understand with our law director where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| If we say yes to the method of disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| then from what you're saying is that the first consideration, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| is the bid that was accepted by the RFP committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| If we do not accept that, we have to have a very good reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| We can't just say, well, we don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| Let's do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| There has to be a legitimate reason why, and those reasons will have to be listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| And here's the other step I think that maybe is being missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| If you approve, we're going to dispose of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| All you're saying tonight is we're going to dispose of this building by RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| Then, when you come to your debate, there are even if you pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4932)|
| 1:22:19| and say we accept your proposal, there's still contract for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| and other issues that are negotiated by the law department and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| that puts commission's designers in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| They can back out on their own, but what you're looking at right now is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| are we going to do it by RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Next month, you're going to look at it and say, well, we're going to award it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| I don't even know who, I can't remember who number one is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| but we're going to award it to number one as bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| and then you can talk to the purchasing and so forth about you can vote on your desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| and we can see if we can negotiate those in the final settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| But otherwise, you just throw it all out and we start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| That's kind of the ball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| But if we say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| And you're at base one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| Then, basically, we're saying, no, we're not going to do it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| and all of the proposals we have are just out the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| I mean, basically, it's all null and void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| We have to go back and begin the process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Yes, but what you're saying is we're not going to sell it by RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| So that leaves negotiated sale or by auction or some other alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| But you can't really say, well, I can't say you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| You all are commissioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| You're the board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| But you really don't want to say we don't want to sell it to RFP this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| but then next week we want to sell it by RFP after this one is moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| Do you see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Because all we're talking about is to say purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| here's the method we want you to use to dispose of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| That is all that's before this board today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| Next month on the deferral is, do we accept the results of that method?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| And then you all can debate whatever modifications you may want to discuss with the winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| You see where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| That's the pure process of it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Or otherwise, you just say, no, let's start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| But you're going to start all over with negotiated sale and auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| And you've said you don't want to do an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| Yeah, I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| You know, I think that because we've gone this far in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| and we gave, you know, maybe we didn't do it by resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| but last July we said we wanted to go through the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| And I think that the RFP process is still the best way to go on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| because I don't think we want to sell it in a closed bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| I don't think we want to have an auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| because we really do lose some control over what we do with it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| But the way that I see that we regain maybe some of the things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| that Commissioner Brown and some of the other concerns that people may have is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| when the family pride people come up here is that we can say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| we're going to put conditions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| We're going to put certain deed restrictions where you can't sell this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| for subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| You can't convert this into just to an ordinary nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| You can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| And not only can they not do it, but if we put it on there as deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| they can't sell it to someone who can do this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| And for them to garner our votes and our supports, they have to agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| Because, you know, for instance, if, I mean, I would put a deed restriction on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| They can't convert this into Section 8 housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| And if he's not willing to do that and if we can't do it, they're not going to get my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| And we'll vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| And then if we vote it down, the process will start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| But I think that's how we have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| I don't think we want to do this any other way than by RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| But I think we can get some of the concerns and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| We can't really have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| I don't think we can get them to totally change their plan to turn it into a shopping mall versus senior housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| because that's not what the RFP was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| But we can put certain deed restrictions on it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| And that's how maybe we can modify this into what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| On the floor is the original motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| We'll do a roll call vote starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5181)|

| 1:27:36| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Mr. Chairman, I need to recuse myself on this because of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| relationship with Tenova, which owns the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| and is selling the property to this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Mr. Chairman, I need to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| I serve on the board, but I receive no monetary money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| from Tenova for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| I'm not recusing myself, but I just have a question for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| Hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| You actually answered it last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| but I just kind of want to get it on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| The only issue I have with this is not the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| is not the sale, and I don't have an issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| The only issue I really have is the 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| That's kind of a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| I just have a little heartburn with a 30-year TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| Commissioner Olinby, I think you've got the wrong guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| It's probably Chris Caldwell or the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| I know you were sitting next to me, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| You might like Hugh's answer better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| So maybe you may want to stay up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| Sure, 30 years is a long time for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| I think the normal TIFs run about 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| I do not believe in the end it will be a 30-year TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| I think it will be more on the lines of 21 to 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| The key is how much do we pay out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| until we get to the $22 million, part city, part county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| We don't know an exact time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| because we don't know what's going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| as far as tax rates and if things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| So what does it take for us to pay back the 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| It won't be 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| It will be 21 to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| Still longer than a normal 15-year TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| but on the flip side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| it's a project that's a lot greater in number too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| Now, I know you explained it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| I know the process, I guess the state comptroller said that it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5382)|
| 1:29:50| they used to be 40 years and now they're 20 and 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| and this falls under the 30-year category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| So that's the only thing I've had a few phone calls about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| is the 30 years is just giving some people concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| I know we'll reach the $22 million before the 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| but how is that process done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| that the comptroller comes to that magical number out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| So we'll do TIFs 101, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| Very convoluted, but we'll try this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| The developer will pay their total taxes to the trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| and to the city tax office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| So they pay the total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Then the county, in our case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| gets to keep the percentage or the pennies dedicated to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| In our case, it's 13% or 31 cents of the $2.36 or $2.32 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5450)|
| 1:30:57| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Chris, could I interrupt you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Mark just walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| Do you want him to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| Trust me, any day of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| That's what he gets paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| Well, we don't have to break it down to the dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| I'm just wondering how the state comptroller came up with 30 years as the magic number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| not necessarily how we, I mean, I know how we accumulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| I'll defer to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| He's our TIF expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| I just want to know how the magic 30-year number was and not 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| Boy, I didn't even hear the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| so this is going to be interesting to come up with the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| As I understand the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| originally when they did the first draft of the TIF Uniformity Act, they put everything at 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| And the honest answer is a bunch of folks said redevelopment, the ramp-up time is slower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| it just takes longer to amortize the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| And he eventually said, you know, that makes sense, and he agreed to a 30-year max on the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| And right now it was 40 years, so that actually was cutting it back from 40 to 30 instead of sort of shortening it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| He sort of shortened the IDB ones from 30 to 20 and shortened the 40-year redevelopment ones to 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Well, I'm not opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| Like I said, I mean, other than I hate that they're tearing down Baptist where I was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| But, you know, so make it a historical landmark, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| No, just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| Mark, didn't you say, I thought you said 15 last year, last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| Didn't you use the term 15 years to amortize this deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| I was just, when I just spoke just a second ago, I was talking about the maximum maturities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| I think the plan as presented would allow them to go up to 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| The amortization, obviously, hopefully would be substantially shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| A lot less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| I don't remember saying 15, but if I did, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| I would be surprised if they would do it in 15, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| Commissioner Shouse is probably, I mean, they could speak to the numbers a little bit better than I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| But my guess is that in the best case scenario, you're probably looking at below 20s before this would be paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| I just, and I'll say more or less what I said last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| I've felt a little queasy about some of these TIFs retail out on North Broadway or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5593)|
| 1:33:20| And I can understand Commissioner McKenzie's reservation some north shore, I guess there was one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5600)|
| 1:33:26| in Watt Road, which hadn't, nothing's happened on that Watt Road there, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| But this one, you know, to make this, to make something happen across the river there, 22 million is a tremendous amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| But I'm thinking of some guy came up to me at church yesterday, guys out on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| and the guy at church said, I can't believe you all are giving these people $22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| So, you know, I explained it as best I could that the county is not, the city is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| It's simply a deferral of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| And someone else said, use the tax-free bond kind of a scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| But whatever happens with that project, the city is not at risk for this 22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| I mean, it's not worth going out and selling 22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| I just want to put that on the table that that is not, we're not throwing this, the city, excuse me, the county taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5645)|
| 1:34:13| he will not have that burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| Hopefully, this is a tremendous success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| It generates lots of activity and lots of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| I think it's going to be a hotel nearby, student housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| And I understand what Mr. Olenby said about the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| But I think most of the buildings will be torn down and rehabilitated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| And it's a tremendous location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| So I think it's a good, I won't say investment, but it's just a good strategy on the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| and the county's part in particular because that's who we represent to move forward on this TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| And this probably would be one, I question some of these retails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| I really think it tends to pad the developer's pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| But I think this is one that probably would not happen without the 22 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| coming forward from the local city and county entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| So I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| Big project, 160 million total, probably be, you know, 200 before it's finally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| But I certainly think it's a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Mark, let me make sure that I understand what I think I got out of TIF 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5716)|
| 1:35:26| What we have before us is $22 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| And it's only going to go toward public improvement, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| It will go, the vast majority of it, vast, probably 75 percent of it will go toward the construction of the Riverwalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5733)|
| 1:35:40| a public terrace, and the demolition necessary to create that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| There will be some, would be used toward demolition, overall demolition cost of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| preparing the site as you're allowed to do under the redevelopment statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| None of it would go to actual construction of any private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Thanks for expanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Then there is right now a current annual tax bill paid, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| There is a current annual tax bill paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| And the slight irony of this one is that the taxes are frozen all the way back to 2005 because this plan was done in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5768)|
| 1:36:17| And so the taxes have actually gone down from 2005 until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| So if the developer does any improvements on the property, both the city and the county will start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| both of them will get about a $50,000 or $60,000 boost in taxes just because of mathematically what has happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| because the property has devalued over the last seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| And so as these then improvements are made, there will still be annual appraisals, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| There will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| Or every four-year appraisals, whatever the property tax guy wants to go and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| It's going to reflect the current value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| And it's that increment in between those is what goes to pay off this loan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| That is all correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| The only minor distinction, and it's not really that minor, is that on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| both the city and the county get that portion of the incremental taxes that are available to pay debt service on your bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5828)|
| 1:37:14| So if 10% of the county's tax rate goes toward debt service, you get 10% of the increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| It does not all go to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| And is there something special that relates to schools built in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| In fact, that was hotly discussed when the most recent legislation on TIFs came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| and the consensus in the legislature and the comptroller was not to do any specific set aside for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5851)|
| 1:37:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| Well, we have a force of motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| The next item is on page 14, Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| It's a resolution to not authorize educational incentive payments from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| for the attainment or recertification of the designation of Certified Public Administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| under the County Technical Assistance Services County Official's Certificate Training Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5884)|
| 1:38:12| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| Commissioner Smith, could you walk me through why you brought this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| and the thought process behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| Sure, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| You know, before the employees were getting bonuses for what I call bonuses for continuing education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| taking a two-week course, getting $3,000, and then every year thereafter you take a two-day course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5917)|
| 1:38:44| and you take the course at your desk, and Knox County pays for the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| Knox County pays you while you're taking the course, and then Knox County bonuses you $3,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| and we knock that down to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| And people are still pretty upset that we're still paying for the course and its own company time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5936)|
| 1:39:04| and then we're still bonusing $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| So we're just trying to do away with the bonus system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| Knox County would still pay for these people that want to take the course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| and there's nothing the matter of the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| The course is a great course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| and they'll still pay their time while they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| As I understand, there's only one office holder now that is paying the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| Everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| Other offices have it, but they don't, and they allow their people to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| and they get the certification, but they're not paying the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| So under this proposal, you're saying that the office holder would be allowed to pay for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| It's just that there would not be additional monies if they pass the program or rest a certain level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| How much money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| We're talking about how much was paid before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| Chris Coll couldn't maybe answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| I don't know if Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| The CTAS program last year, whatever, ballpark, what was it, Chris, we were paying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| I looked at it several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| I can't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| It's not a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| I can't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| I printed it out the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| I cannot remember that amount for CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| I want to think $15,000, but that's just a guess on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| But, I mean, that's just counting the piece that the county pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| It doesn't count the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| We get reimbursed for the state on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| If you're an elected official and you want to still continue taking it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| you will still get your $3,000 or whatever from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| The state will still pay that to the elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| But in terms of the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| it would be basically up to the elected official to determine who would take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| In other words, if you had 15 people in your office who said, yeah, I want to take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| Knox County is going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| They would still, I mean, they could conceivably do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| But do we have a cap on what that is or just anyone that would want to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| It's open to anybody that wants to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| It's not, you know, and what it's used for is to serve better government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| and to work the counters better and to be better equipped to answer questions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| for other office holders, what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| It's just government one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| And you say the elected official can still take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| and they'll be reimbursed by the state and get $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| This doesn't include deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| It doesn't include, it's just the elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| And another reason, there's a lot of, probably half of us on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| as commissioners, have to take continuing ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| It comes out of our pocket for whatever profession that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| And we surely don't get bonus for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| Now, some places may pay for your continuing ed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| but nobody I know of that will bonus anybody for completing the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| You know, you get your bonus when you get the promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| That's what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| It's to be on your resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| You know, that's why I'm in support of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| I actually think it's a bonus for us to pay for their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| I mean, a lot of employers won't pay for the time that it takes a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| to go out there and take these online courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| They can do it on their own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| So I think that's actually a nice little carrot for the county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| You know, and I'm operating on the premise that everyone's qualified to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| So, you know, when I hear, well, it'll help you do your job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| you should be qualified to do the job that you've been assigned to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| that the county's paying you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| And like Commissioner Smith said, so anything else should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| you're building your resume, you're building your skill set for a promotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| or a raise or to get to that next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| And that, to me, is why these, you know, classes are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| If I'm in my job or you're in your job, as things change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| I'm to keep up with those changes in the law or in the administrative processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| That's my job to keep up with the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| But this is something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| This is, in my estimation, something that enhances you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| It's a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| I mean, you know, we've all probably been to a CTAS event over the years on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| So they do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| But to give a bonus in addition to paying for the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| and paying for the time it takes to take the course is a bit much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| So that's my reason for supporting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| Yeah, I just had a question, and this may be a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| You know, particularly in the fee offices is where they pay people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| the office holder there collects the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| He, you know, he does what it takes to run his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| And if he deems this is what it takes to run his office, can we control what he does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6228)|
| 1:43:54| or doesn't do in his office, particularly in the fee offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| In other words, can we tell that elected office holder not to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| When we don't control his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| Well, you do in the salary suit piece, and it would be up to the negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| And the county's policy, if passed here, would be no, but can the judiciary overrule that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6250)|
| 1:44:18| Of course they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| So it's one of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| Just one last thing I want to mention to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| You know, I've been pretty outspoken on this for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| I'm not going to come back next month and say, okay, now we don't want even to pay for the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| This is it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| I just wanted to take care of the bonus system and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6277)|

| 1:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| Page 16, discussion regarding the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| Yes, so we had our monthly meeting on October the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6364)|
| 1:46:12| Our next meeting is going to be Thursday, November the 7th, 430 at the Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6372)|
| 1:46:21| This was kind of our first meeting where we dug into issues now that we've kind of settled our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6381)|
| 1:46:30| So to give you a thumbnail sketch of things that we discussed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| the fact that we are going to discuss those difficult topics that tend to come up in either body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6396)|
| 1:46:43| and hopefully we're going to learn a process to better manage the issues and, more importantly, the message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6403)|
| 1:46:50| I think sometimes a message can go out and it comes out as inflammatory on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| and I think we all agreed on that and that we need to manage that process a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| So we focused on what would come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| What are some of the things that will come before that joint committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6426)|
| 1:47:13| Real estate issues, that's kind of been a thorn in my side there, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6433)|
| 1:47:20| I looked at South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| If this body got South Knoxville a lot earlier, I think we could have done something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| South Knoxville Elementary, you know, it came in late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| It came in dilapidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| And so, you know, how can we better understand their needs and not, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| getting too far into their side of the house and understand what their needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| They may have needs that we don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| So that's something that we feel should come before us prior to going to either body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| So before they start voting on things and surplusing properties or not surplusing properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6471)|
| 1:47:57| those things should come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Budgetary issues, you know, so that there's not a big surprise when the mayor rolls out his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6479)|
| 1:48:06| If there's going to be a big push, like there was a couple of years ago, that we would, you know, catch a clue on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6486)|
| 1:48:15| And the same with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| If we're going to push a thing that doesn't fall into that recurring piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6496)|
| 1:48:23| we would like to present that to them in a smaller group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6503)|
| 1:48:29| And then kind of one-off comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| You know, a comment about we're out of control and commission, or they're out of control and commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| and it'd be an education issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| We would really like for those things to, and I think we've done a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| I think we've done a good job on that one since this committee's been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| Hey, let's table that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| It sounds like a legitimate concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| Let's table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| Let's present it at that joint education committee meeting, you know, and discuss it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| And we'll bring back, the four of us will bring back an answer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| You know, and then just what else is out there that we need to be educated on, both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| And that's why the chair, Lynn Fugate-Cain, to our lunch today, just to try to open up that dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6551)|
| 1:49:20| Hopefully we'll continue to show up at third places as well if there's something that we need to educate them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6560)|
| 1:49:28| Because they do have a pretty, you know, narrow lens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| I mean, ours is a big lens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| It's two-thirds of the budget, but it doesn't, you know, it's not as far reaching as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| And then the last thing that we, I don't know if we voted on it, Commissioner Hammer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| but we said that we want this committee vote, I think unanimously feels that we do need to have another retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6586)|
| 1:49:56| It's been a couple of years at this point, and that we would like to have something in the winter as far as a retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6596)|
| 1:50:03| And I think both chairs will, I think Chair Fugate will get with you, Brad, and try to hash that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6603)|
| 1:50:12| So those are the things that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| Again, everyone's welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| We're going to meet again November the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| I received actually, I guess this thing must play over and over on CTV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| but I've got a lot of positive comments about things that I guess we're educating the public as we sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| and dialogue in a square table that people don't necessarily realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| So I think it was a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| So I'll defer to the other committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| Continuing on that small committee, I would like to express my appreciation for Board Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6648)|
| 1:50:56| Ms. Fugate being at our chairman's lunch earlier today carrying to us those words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6656)|
| 1:51:03| reinforcing the words that Commissioner McKenzie has just given us on how that committee should work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| and what we ought, you know, what she would like for it to do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| So I appreciate her being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| Unless, is there something else to be said on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| If you don't mind, to make an announcement on tomorrow's meeting at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| You've been to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| You've already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| There is an ongoing effort by the Board of Education to have meetings to gather public input on what has gone well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6692)|
| 1:51:41| what's not, and what's next, the way they've laid it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| Five of those meetings are behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| There's a meeting tomorrow evening at Austin East at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| I believe the doors will open at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| They have snacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| So anyone that would like to make comment to the operation of the Board of Education's policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6716)|
| 1:52:03| and system of the school system should be at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| And you'll be divided up into small groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| and everyone's word will be taken and plowed into the big report to be delivered by Parthenon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6729)|
| 1:52:19| And what they're looking at is the next five years in terms of a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| I'm talking to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| I think most of us are either scheduled to meet with the folks across the street in the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6746)|
| 1:52:33| but they're asking us the same question they're going to ask the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| But it's those three questions that Commissioner Wright pointed out, what's good, what's not, and what's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| And it's to get that next five years in terms of a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| So I encourage everyone to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| And I think they also have talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| They've had talent at each of the five previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| Each program is opened by student presentation, music, or student presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6774)|
| 1:53:02| And then each meeting has also been closed by a different group doing another presentation from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6782)|
| 1:53:12| I'm going to change the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| So prior to us changing the subject, is this too much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| Is this enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| Is this about right in terms of what we report back to you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| Please let us know if it gets either direction, too much or not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| We have one more discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Let's get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| That's regarding Knoxville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| Commissioner Brown, did you still want to discuss Knoxville High School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| This is not a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| This is a thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| And it's a thank you to you personally, the chair of commission, also to Larry Smith, the vice chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6826)|
| 1:53:55| also county commissioner at large, passing behind me, Ed Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6835)|
| 1:54:01| Earlier today there was a ribbon cutting at a small business, Callahan Road exit on Central Avenue Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6841)|
| 1:54:10| The function was at the request of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| So, really, my biggest thank you goes to the mayor of Knox County, Mayor Tim Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| for realizing that it's small business that really, and this is our irony, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6860)|
| 1:54:26| it's small business that greases the cogs of growth in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| Well, this is with barbecue grease because this is Archer's Barbecue that was having a grand opening, ribbon cutting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6871)|
| 1:54:41| and the place really smells like good barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| So I wanted to thank everyone that went and participated in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| And I've talked to a couple of people since just, and where have you been today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| And they say they're going to go try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| So thanks to all those that were at that ribbon cutting this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| Any other business to come before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| Just a disclaimer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131028?start=6906)|
