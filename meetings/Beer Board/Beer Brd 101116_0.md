| 0:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| I had a question about the measurements on this location, and I know I've had this question in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| The nearest church that's listed is St. George Greek Orthodox, which is way over in Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| There's actually a very small, I think, Baptist church right there in Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| I know I've called you all about this before, and I meant to drive by and eyeball it and did not get a chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| Did the inspector measure from that church or only from St. George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| We're going to look and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| Do you want to hear Central and then come back to this since I have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| It's the same applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| I didn't call the office this afternoon to ask about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| We'll go ahead and take a breather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=213)|
| 0:03:53| I guess, Ms. Roddy, where's the church you're speaking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| I'm not picturing the one on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| This property is across the street from West High School, and if you were traveling westbound on Sutherland Avenue toward the gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=242)|
| 0:04:13| there's a car wash, and right across the side street from the car wash, there's a small church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| Kind of across from the armory and across from West High School, right in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| And I guess, Mr. Swanson, I'm looking at this, the map we've got, and it's showing a building on a far end of a parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=264)|
| 0:04:33| but it's parcel boundary to parcel boundary, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| Building line to building line is the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| I look at this, and if it's west, Ms. Roddy, from the edge of that building, it's 300 feet to their property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=280)|
| 0:04:48| Looks like Ms. Day has some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Our experience has been that if engineering doesn't see anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| and it's nothing is more or less than 300 feet, they don't write it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| They measured from St. George's, because that's what was listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| They didn't add anything, so that would lead me to believe there was nothing that was closer than 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| And I don't have a computer in front of me, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| And so it's not, you don't measure from the edge of the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| You measure from the edge of the actual tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| The property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Building line to building line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Building line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| Building line to building line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Yeah, I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| On the summary sheet here, there were fire code violations at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| What were those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Those are back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| Those were previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| That was for me, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| When I ran a, I used to, I was general manager of Hanna's in the old city back in like 05, maybe 06,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| and there was just overcrowding by fire code violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| Those were previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=370)|

| 0:06:25| Okay, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=385)|

| 0:07:07| I think it's a magnet school, but green school is actually closer than Sequoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=427)|

| 0:07:27| Haru, Hibachi, and Sushi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=447)|
| 0:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| This item has been on our agenda several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| and I had occasion to be driving down Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| and I noticed that there are some hand-lettered, like, notices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| a couple of typed notices, but there's no signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| There's nothing to indicate this place is ready to open or near opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| I didn't venture up to try to read what the signage was that had been posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| but there is not evidence driving by that this is ready for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Councilwoman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Mr. Chairman, in addition, there appears to be some distance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| Well, I think that that is the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| I know that they were before us and they were applying for an ABC license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| so, you know, I'm probably going to assume that that's what the problem is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| but I still would like to go ahead and make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| that we move them to the heel of the agenda in case they do show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| There's been a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Seeing no other lights, all those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=523)|
| 0:08:53| Hot Rods, 2909 Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| Rex Goins, 2909 Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| For Mr. Terry Kenner, city court records indicate sale at places where dancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| allowed conviction March 31st of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| We're waiting on approval from the health department and surrender of the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Mr. Swanson, we have this information from the police department on the record checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| Is this information germane in terms of our consideration of this permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| What Section 437 says is that no permittee shall be a person who has been convicted of any violation of any ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| related to the possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| or convicted of any violation of the laws against possession, sale, manufacture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| or transportation of alcoholic beverages or beer or any crime involving moral turpitude within the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| This would not be a crime involving moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| So the issue is, is it any of those other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| And as I look through those other things, I really don't think that what he's convicted of is allowing a person who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=609)|
| 0:10:17| shouldn't, who's not old enough to be in an establishment in an establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| But that is really not possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| So I think it is not a qualifying offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| And the nonpayment of the beer permit in the beer permit fee in 2007 doesn't relate either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Thank you for addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| One more question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| Bonnie, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Yeah, we're waiting on the Health Department approval and the surrender of the previous beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Counselwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Sorry, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| I guess I'd like to address the permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| The conviction regarding the locked fire exit, obviously that's something that is very frightening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| and I'm sure won't happen again with your establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| But we want to make sure that all the establishments that we offer permits to are safe for all their patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| It's my district, so I'll make the motion to approve subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Seeing no further lines, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| If you'll see Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Tobacco Express has asked for a deferral until the 28th of December, our next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| So I will make the motion that we accept that deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Seeing no lines, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| With Smith Market and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=711)|
| 0:12:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| 2240 Wood Smith Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| We just need to have the previous beer permit surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| This is the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| That's the woman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| I was just going to ask Councilwoman Palmer, this is in a C1 zone, which is neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| So I always like to double check with the council member of that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| You know, neighborhood commercial is usually very much integrated into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| and make sure I'm not familiar with this location, that the surrounding residents are comfortable with this and so workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| They appear to be comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Seeing no further lines, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| Those like to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| If you'll see Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| If you'll see Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| If you'll see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| I didn't see anybody else come in, but I will call for Haru one last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| I see no one coming to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| You know, I guess we give them the benefit of the doubt for another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| I mean, it would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| That's, you know, it's the second district and we'll certainly take discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| And I will start with Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| This is the third or fourth time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Is it fourth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| You know, I guess the question I have is how many chances do we give someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| And if they don't even show up to ask for a deferment, I even have more of a problem then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| So I think as far as I'm concerned, being in this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| that what I would say is that they can start the process over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=832)|
| 0:14:00| Last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| I would tend to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| At some level, I think there's some disrespect, some level of not understanding the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| But I would hate to say to somebody, you missed a meeting, we're going to make you file, spend a whole lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| But I'm not going to make a motion to postpone if the district rep won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| But my tendency isn't this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| This hasn't been that long yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| So, but it's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| Well, I tend to agree with you, Chairman, and the Vice Mayor, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| I just would lean on another 30 days or, you know, to the next beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| give them the benefit of the doubt and then see if we can't make sure that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Receive written notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| Maybe the member from the second district could try to track down the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| I know that recently happened successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| But I'm in favor of postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| And I'd be willing to help try to track down the applicant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| Dottie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| We received approval from the fire inspector today for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| So they are engaged in preparing to have the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| And they do receive written notification of the meeting that they should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| Well, I mean, that's certainly late-breaking news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| I mean, I'll defer to the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| I was not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| I'll go ahead and move that we give them 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| That's a motion to defer until the 28th of December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| And there was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Seeing no further alliance, all those in favor of the deferral say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| That is the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Presented for your entertainment and consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| the Marble City Brewing Company was approved subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=959)|
| 0:16:07| And I believe they're here to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| I'm Jonathan Bersotti with the Marble City Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| We had requested two beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| We've gotten the manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| We've done the fire in the building on an off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| We're still finishing up some stuff to get the health department through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| We just respectfully request another 90 days to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| This is sixth district, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| You might want to put a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| We'll just need to put a date on it to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| You only ask for 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| That should do us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| So the motion will be to extend until 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Seeing no last, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Santa Fe, Asheville Highway, haven't they been, were they here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| Several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| They were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| This is the one that Mr. Dellavolpe followed up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| And we've had a difficult time contacting the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| but we have learned from a third party that they are still negotiating use of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| because, as you may remember or not, the owner of the property is deceased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| and the family is now handling the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| And they're trying to resolve some remaining issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| And I understand that this person intends to have the business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| So do you want to give them more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| Well, in the council, Councilman Dellavolpe is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| I'll make a motion that we, you know, extend it another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| And if you would please make sure that he's aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| because he seems to be able to sniff them out pretty good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| So I'll make that a motion that we defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| And seeing no last, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| We also, this evening, have some administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| And first up would be Circle T Market in Daly, 401 North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| Teresa Tool, 401 South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| And I would assume you understand the reason that you're before us this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| So if you want to go over your remedial plan as to what you have done in your business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| to perhaps not have you down here on this type of occasions again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| I have done another training program with all the employees, all four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| And the two employees that were cited on these different cases are no longer employed with our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1151)|
| 0:19:20| Yeah, well, that, you know, I always hate hearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| I just, you know, that really, I don't know that that solves the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| There's two other people that's out of work that have gone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Well, not necessarily just for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| If you'll let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| And then, you know, it's really, it's on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| You're the owner of the business to make sure that folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| I understand you can't be there 24-7 and follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| But to say that they were let go really doesn't weigh out with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| It was for different reasons other than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Well, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| I guess, Sergeant, we've had in the past a list that would give us when the violations occurred, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| Do we have that for this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| No, actually, I don't today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| I guess it's very, that actually is a very helpful thing to talk about, when they happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| Can you tell us real quickly what went wrong the two times sales happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| On my letter on February 25th was one of the sting operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| The girl that was working did card the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| She missed the date by like two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| The first occasion, were you there when Chester was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| He did card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| He did card also and missed the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| And did misread it or misadded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| I think both of them were off by like two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| And do you all have something that says, you know, one of those things that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| if before this date, don't sell it to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| I have one on the counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Well, I'm concerned that this has happened two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| You've had your employees go through training probably a second time for some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| Many of the businesses that have this problem will have something attached to the register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| some kind of software program or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| so that the sale can't go through if the date is not within the parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| Have you considered something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| I have looked at a piece of equipment that we could order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| It's around $1,000, where they could scan their ID in order to have a new register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| that would do that, that hooks up to our gas pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| We're talking like $10,000, and I don't have $10,000 to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| But I would consider getting the $1,000 scanner that they would actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| every person that bought beer, scan the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| and it tells you if they're of age for ID or cigarettes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| Well, I understand that it is very expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| but I also understand that losing your license is even more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| And, you know, you don't want this to happen again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| and we only want to see you here for renewal purposes, not for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Could you explain a little bit about the retraining?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| You said you retrained your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Could you kind of walk us through that a little more specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| I just sat down with them at different dates and asked them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| if I come in with this, you know, who's legal on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| And explained to them that every person that came in there had to be carded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| and I didn't care how long they had to stand there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| If they had a, you know, if they were concerned that it might not be exactly right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| then take the time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Don't just look at the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| They're looking at the year, and they're not looking at the month and day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| Well, we do have available some remedial tips, I mean, you know, some tips to train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| And sometimes, I didn't mean that that way, but, you know, we've got sometimes you can't afford the electronic devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1376)|
| 0:23:04| And what I really like to see is someone that demonstrates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| or can really express their true desire and interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| And if it's little things, if it's, you know, posting dates, if it's posting week hard, you know, just to show us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1392)|
| 0:23:21| We have all those at our store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Could you kind of go through a few of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Well, I mean, we have on the counter, right in front of the register, there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| On the front door, there is a week hard sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| But the one on the counter also tells employees, I've got it facing towards employees of what date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1412)|
| 0:23:41| We've also got these kits in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Well, I was going to ask, I was going to say I'd be willing to, as Ms. Brody had talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| getting one of those kits to go through with employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| And I'll address or recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Over to Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| I think what we're struggling with is that you're just saying you're going to try harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| And I'm looking for a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| I'm looking for something that you're going to do different in the whole process of how you engage the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| And I haven't really heard what you're going to do different, differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| So tell me, what are you going to do differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| That's going to resolve this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| I guess what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to order the card scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| I mean, I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| I can afford to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| I just can't afford to buy a system, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| I mean, that's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Your plan didn't include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| And I'm not saying that training isn't important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| You really do need to invest in your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| But in terms of the system, I just don't see any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| And so that's what I'm struggling with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| I concur with my colleagues that I think the applicant is very sincere in her desire to make some changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| but we're not hearing enough concrete things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And I did hear her say that her business could possibly afford the scanner, the $1,000 piece of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| I think oftentimes when very well-intentioned, honest employees are trying to read a date on a card and do the math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1517)|
| 0:25:25| and there's a date on a calendar and there's a line or it's busy or it's late, it's just hard to process all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| And the scanner does help to remove some of the human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| The Metropolitan Drug Commission, of which I'm a representative of this board to, does maintain a list of tips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| and we work with the police department on that, and we also have some kits in the back for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| I wonder, Mr. Chairman, if we ever postpone hearing one of these items to give the applicant a chance to avail herself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1545)|
| 0:25:55| of some of the training that the Drug Commission has available and to purchase this piece of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| She seems sincere in her desire to do that and amend her remedial plan such that when she came back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| we had a more concrete assurance of what kind of preventative measures were in place going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| I would agree with that to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| I think that it would be fine that we defer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| I don't know that we want to lay out a plan for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| No, certainly she needs to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| I think my thought was that if she could come back with some more concrete measures, that right now this remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| at least for me personally, doesn't address my concerns about mis-carding going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| So I'll make that as a motion to defer to the next regularly scheduled beer ward meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Okay, so there's a motion and a second, but we've still got lots here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| I think that's actually a great idea, and I think some of what's happening is I think we do hear, as Ms. Roddy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| a desire for you to improve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| and I think what we're hoping is this gives you a month to think about what can I do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| And maybe it is buying the machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Maybe you get this packet and you look at some other ideas that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Actually, I kind of like the idea of the postponement to say the plan's not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| We're not going to come down on you yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| We want you to make it a better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| So I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| Are you going to explain to this person the opportunity that we're extending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| That's exactly the next order of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| And, you know, I don't want you to think that, you know, we're giving you a public lashing, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| I mean, this is to make, hopefully, your business better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| and you can just come down here and just sit in the audience and not have to worry about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| You know, I know this is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| I was kind of thrown into this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| I haven't ever done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Well, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| So, you know, what training I've had is pretty nil to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| So, I mean, I think that reinforces the motion that is before us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| And, again, I mean, we don't want to put businesses, you know, people out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| We're here, you know, as an administrative board this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| but also to let you know that, number one, you know, we're very serious about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| and we think that you are, too, but, you know, we would just like to see a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| The rest of your plan, I think, needs to be fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| So, seeing no other lights, there was a councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| So what we're going to do is we're going to help her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| and provide her with some tips and procedures and some methods that she could then review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| and see if those would work for you, and then you'll put a plan together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| and when you come back, you'll present it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| I think that that describes it perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| And that's, you know, one of the processes, I think, that I've heard that needs to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| and perhaps if there's other things that you want to supplement that with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| then that's your business decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| So was there a date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Was it to the next, the 28th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Next regular schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Okay, regular schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| It's a motion, and it was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Seeing no further lights, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| So if you'll be back on the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| And we'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Of December, and we will finalize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| I think it's Agave Azul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| I think, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Agave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Agave Azul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| I've eaten there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| I've always wondered how it was pronounced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| My name is Vladimir Villalba, and it's 4405 Kingson Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Well, you've been sitting in the audience, and I think you understand how this process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| So if you will go through your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| We've been discussing this with all the employees at every shift, you know, telling them what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| what we would like not to happen again for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| You know, it's a very expensive drink that we have been paying for the past couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| Could you move a little bit closer to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| And we have been discussing this with all the employees at every shift, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| trying to tell them what happened and what we would like not to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| And sometimes it's very, very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Like somebody was saying, you know, at the end of the night, you know, when you're tired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| you've been working all day, long hours, you know, to pay attention to the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| sometimes you pay attention to the year, but you don't pay attention to the month or the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| and it causes to have these kind of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| We also have been – we already got the tools from the drug commission, like, you know, the DVDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1852)|
| 0:31:01| these kind of things, and we've been trying to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| I've been showing it to all the employees so they can see, you know, different situations that could happen to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| you know, people from saying, you know, I'm old enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| Do I look old enough in order for me to show you my ID or to get a drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| You know, other where, like, an older person will ask to buy a drink for somebody that is younger saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| okay, I'm mom and dad, or I can, you know, certify that this person is old enough to buy a drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| And those kind of things, we see them on the video, and we have run into those situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| and I tell them no matter what, I mean, if they can tell me if they're like their parents or these kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1903)|
| 0:31:52| and if they don't show me an ID, just – I'd rather have two people leave the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| than have to go through this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| I also got a couple more of those displays where they have the data born on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| I used to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I got three in each station, so almost every server can, you know, take a look at that in order for them to bring up a drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1928)|
| 0:32:18| I also have got, like, those ID guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| I got three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| One by the register, one at the bar, and one in the office in case one of these get lost so I can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| have one available anytime we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| And we also, I mean, like you are saying, we ask you guys if you guys can provide us with any kind of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1953)|
| 0:32:45| tips, anything that can help us to prevent this so we can show our employees, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1965)|
| 0:32:54| that it's very important for them to really take a look, and sometimes it's better to take, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| to waste like five seconds to really take a look at something so simple like a date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| than just having to go through all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| Because like you were saying, you know, it's easy for me to say that I can just terminate this employer for making a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| but still that doesn't help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| You know, that doesn't solve the problem because if my other employees are not getting the right information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| well, let's get to know what happens when, you know, they make a mistake of this kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| You know, we can lose our license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| You know, and right now business being so bad, you know, in a business like us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| selling alcohol is something that we make profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| And if we don't get to sell alcohol, I mean, people will not go to our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| And if we cannot make to at least make expenses, if we're not, you know, closing our business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| it's going to be like not just one employee at a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| It's going to be all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| So that's what we've been discussing with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| That's my rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Yeah, a couple quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| It sounds like you actually have thought some about a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| One of the issues, a couple quick things, is your system, you're a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| so you've got waitresses going out, waiters going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| Are you counting on them to check the ID while they're getting the order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| It's done that way, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| Are there some places where the ID actually has to be checked by a manager or a bartender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| or somebody other than that front-line person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| I don't know if that's been thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| In a regular day, you know, like almost every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| unless we have like some kind of like events where we will be expecting like a large amount of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| when we have, for example, you know, like a Cinco de Mayo where everybody shows up at the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| and once we have special people by the door, you know, calling and putting something on their hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| putting those wristbands and telling all the servers inside the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| saying if you feel like you need to ask one more time for a diet ID, go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| Do not hesitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| If you don't have the time, if you ask me to do it for you, I will be more than happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| So your waitresses, waiters know if they've got a question, they come to you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Second question is you obviously had two violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| What happened those two times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| What did they read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Did they get an ID both times or what went wrong that needs to be fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| The first time, I'm going to be honest with you, I really don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| I can tell you the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| The second time, there were these two girls that walked into the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| and from what I was told by the officer is basically my server did carve both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| I think one was old enough and the other wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| I can't remember if it was just like the month or the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| but I guess checking the first one and seeing that it was okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| I guess he assumed that the other one was right too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| And Sergeant, do you have any sense what happened the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| Do you have any records with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| It's an interesting sort of, again, if what went wrong is always worth trying to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| I mean, I tell you, that table should not go into the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| because we were already like getting ready to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| And it was funny because they said they didn't ask for a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| They didn't wait to be seated, and they just walked into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| And when the server said, oh, who's going to take care of that table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| It's like it seems like nobody just go for it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| because if they're sitting there waiting for someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| and everybody's trying to clean up their side jobs so they can go home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| it's like, you know, if you've got the time, go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| And he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| It's probably worth figuring out what happened the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| just for you to sort of think, you know, we've had two times we've failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| We sort of understand one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Let's get a better sense of what happened the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| to make sure there's not a hole in our system someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| I'm pleased to see that you were able to get the kit with the video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| that has some tips about prevention that's happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| And you mentioned that there's a test in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| that the employees can take after watching the video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| to make sure that they understood the material that was covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| Have all your employees taken the test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| I've still got one more to return the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| He was supposed to return it today, but I left the restaurant before he showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| So everyone has at least at the minimum watched the training video?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| And I know Ms. Pouncey is in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Does the kit include those overlay cards that Top Shelf provides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| One of the things that I think we found is really helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| and as Councilman Becker or Vice Mayor Becker pointed out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| our last individual was sales off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| And so that's a little bit different than when you're serving in a restaurant situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| And these cards are an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| It's the same size as the ID, and it's an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| And there's a cutout, so all you can see is the birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| And then there's information on the overlay card that helps you to very quickly identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| whether or not this birth date is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| And that and a flashlight, you know, particularly in a low-light restaurant situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| can alleviate a lot of errors as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Is there any of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| I see no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| We appreciate you coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| You know, I'd just like to say that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| I'd like to include a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| When we have folks come down here, if the employees, if it were possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| that were cited and if they're still employed, come to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| I think it would have a tremendous impact on somebody to go back and say, oh, my gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| that was a really serious meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| You know, we understand the importance of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| You know, this license was in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| And, you know, hopefully that would resonate through the rest of the servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| I think it would be a very healthy thing for us to perhaps look at down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| But, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| No, I won't mention the name of the business had their employees watching on Channel 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| I went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| They invited me to come by afterwards, and it had an impact on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Well, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| I think it would even be more of an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Because they really cared about the owner and his license and their jobs and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| It really hit home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| I wouldn't want to interrupt shifts, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| I think it would really be impactful for them to be standing next to this gentleman right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| So just something from the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| There being oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| I spoke with their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| He had asked for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| There was a conflict there until the councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| What happens if someone has an illegal ID and is carded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| In other words, what responsibility does the restaurant or the bar have when someone comes in with a fake ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2416)|
| 0:40:26| It would be up to them to notify us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| It would be up to the business to notify us if they've got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| If they notice it's a fake ID, then as far as I would imagine, it's just whatever their company policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2432)|
| 0:40:42| But, I mean, are they held responsible for selling alcohol to an underage person if they have a fake ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| Yes, they're still responsible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| I know that's one of the objectives that's covered in the task class as far as what to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| And definitely in those ID guides, it covers the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| I was actually going to, you were talking about the roaming gnome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I wanted to hear sort of why they need a postponement, and it sounded like you were about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| They had just engaged this attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| and he just did not feel comfortable with being able to put together a remedial plan that would suit this board in that short of a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2482)|
| 0:41:32| I mean, the other side of that was I would have wished that they perhaps would have engaged that person earlier, but they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| And he sounded very sincere in their moving forward that they'd have a good remedial plan for us if we gave them this postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2499)|
| 0:41:47| And you suggested that the postponement, they're obviously not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| You didn't say to them, show up, council's got to decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| I told him that that was his business decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| I said, I cannot guarantee you a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| And he knew that full well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| And I said, well, should I be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| And I said, if they want to pay you to come down here, that's a business decision for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| And I'm a little bit surprised that they're not here, but we did discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2531)|
| 0:42:19| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Chairman, you know, this issue of distance requirements has come up over a period of time since I've been here, from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2540)|
| 0:42:29| And, you know, when you look at the boxes and you see that they're checked, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| I assumed that that had been for the longest time that somebody had gone out and measured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| or remeasured and all that was taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| And I'm not really sure exactly how that works now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| And what I would like to maybe recommend is that we ask somebody from engineering to come to one of the beer board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| and explain what the current procedure is for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| And also, you know, because if we're going to, like in previous meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| someone has brought it to our attention that there's a school or there's a church that is closer than the one listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| And if we raise that publicly, somebody ought to be here to speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| because we need to make sure that we're doing, you know, the best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| and that we look like we know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| I mean, it ought to appear that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| At least the perception is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| So I'd just like to suggest that maybe we ask Steve King or somebody from engineering to come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| or be present during the meeting so in the event that something like that comes up, they can answer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2612)|
| 0:43:41| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| It's an interesting idea, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| I almost think that the way you said it first is have somebody come explain how they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| I think tonight there was some of this question of, I mean, clearly if they spot something closer, we know it's an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| but have they checked something that might be right on the edge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| I don't know if it's worth having somebody from engineering at every meeting, because it really doesn't come up that often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| but I do like the idea of having somebody come explain how they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| I guess I wanted just to go back to sort of the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| I assume we need a motion on a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| I'll go ahead and make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| And I guess my one suggestion is the next time somebody asks, you might want to say, yeah, you should be there anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| because it doesn't make me feel good for them just to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| it feels like a postponement is just giving them more time to maybe have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| I don't think this one's been open that long, and I'm a little worried about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| But I will go with a postponement this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| I concur with Vice Mayor Becker, although I did argue in favor of a postponement with one of our previous applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| to give her some more time to develop a more fully fleshed out plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| There was certainly some effort made first by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| The second violation at this establishment happened last April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| and to come to a meeting at the end of November and say we haven't had time to put a plan together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| to me rings really false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| They've known about this date for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I'm sure Ms. Mitchell has let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| And I don't think we want to get into a situation where folks who have these violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| or who are called to administrative hearings are under the assumption that they can just be postponed if they don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2725)|
| 0:45:33| You know, we don't have anything on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| We don't have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| And they knew at the time of their second violation that this was an issue and it threatened their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| And I'm just really uncomfortable with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| and the precedent that it might set and the message that we as a beer board send to other establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| who are permittees in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| Mr. Chet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| So what happens if we don't postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| Well, I really, you know, I don't know what we would do, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| I mean, we could move it forward to a full-blown suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2764)|
| 0:46:12| Those are really your options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Your options are to postpone it or to recommend that it be sent to a suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2773)|
| 0:46:20| I don't think there are really any other available options out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| And, you know, and I want to, Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| If it goes to a suspension and revocation hearing and they appear with a plan that is viable, then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2788)|
| 0:46:36| That's up to the law department and the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| And I, Councilman Grieve, your line, are you still, is that an old line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| I guess, you know, my motion is on the floor without a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| I'd say, you know, one of the challenges is it can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| A suspension revocation hearing doesn't mean that their license will be suspended or revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| But it does sort of miss our opportunity to do what we did with the first violator here of, say, you've got to do a little better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2817)|
| 0:47:05| And I'm a little worried about putting Mr. Pavlis out on a limb on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| I don't, I think you sound like you were clear about, you know, saying, you know, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| and that's where my recommendation is in the future that you say you should be there, even if you request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| And I know it's a hard thing to put you in that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| But I would hate for somebody to be mad at you when we make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| I just think if you go back and look at the date, as Councilman Roddy pointed out, I mean, this was back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| And it seems like we need to take ourselves seriously in terms of what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| And if the person's had that long a time, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| it goes back to what I was saying with the first person that I said we ought to not postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| If they don't even show up or send a representative, I mean, that tells me that, well, gee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| come December, January, maybe by next April we'll have this resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| And I think there's a point in which we can give and help and just like we did with the previous person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| But I think this is really stretching it in terms of how long it's been on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| I agree with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| For a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| You know, I just, when you print this up, postponement requested, when did that, when were these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2905)|
| 0:48:34| when did that go out initially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Just today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| I mean, we just received these this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| But now they contacted Ms. Mitchell at the end of last week and I spoke with their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| I believe it was Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| It was either Thursday or Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| And, again, you know, I want it very clear that I told them it was their business decision if they were going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| if he was going to be here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| I mean, I understand what Vice Mayor Becker is saying as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| but I also have a problem, you know, telling a business they've got to spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| But, you know, their license is at Jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| And that's why I told them, you know, it's your business decision to be here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| I will support the postponement tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| I just, I think, because I think there's reasonable doubt as to the communication, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| the applicant communicated with our chairman and with Ms. Mitchell in the BEER office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| and there may have been an implication that was unintended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| And I don't want anybody to think that the communication wasn't right in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| But I think going forward, we need to all understand that a postponement isn't automatic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| and that particularly as long as we all know that these accusations after the stings take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| these allegations, I guess is the right word, take a long time to process through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| And when they come to our hearing, our administrative hearing, months and months later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| our expectation is that applicants will be prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| and will have a solid plan in place for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| And, you know, well, one thing, I mean, and I would certainly be open to, as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| I mean, if it's the will of this board that I say, yes, you need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| I don't think it should be an individual call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| I mean, I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| But if that's the will of this board, I don't have any problem at all saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Well, I'm going to support the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| but I was just kind of curious how these things are scheduled anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| how it's determined when it comes before us and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| how important is it to hear it on a timely schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| I get notice from the police department on their stings, and when there is a history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| has had two sales, then we put it on our list to schedule an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| As you know, we've had a change in the beer inspections office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| and that delayed these hearings longer than typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| But in fairness to Sergeant Hunter, to give her a chance to get acclimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| and used to this whole situation, then these are a little bit later than typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| And hopefully if it's postponed, they'll be here at the next beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| and we can hear what they were thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Yeah, and I would, you know, speaking with the gentleman, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| I don't think that they won't not show up at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| I mean, I think he was very sincere in his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Yeah, I guess just it was a fair question, Mr. Chairman, about what you should convey to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| And I don't want to tie your hands for somebody calling and saying there's a death in the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| you know, for legitimate reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| I almost hate saying I don't want to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| but what I feel like saying is when people call you, I'm going to trust you to convey the right information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| And I think you conveyed it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| I think what you conveyed to them is I'm not going to make the call, but you should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| And that's exactly the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| But I don't want you to say to somebody when you think there's a really good reason that they have to miss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| that they have to be here and somehow the board's forcing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| I know you'd like more clarity on that, but I'm going to trust your judgment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| And I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| I mean, that's, you know, as chair of the board, I guess, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| I should be responsible to make those calls like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| And, you know, he requested and I was very clear that it was certainly their decision whether they were here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3160)|
| 0:52:48| and there was no and at no time did that person hang up the phone call and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| well, I think it's a sure thing because we've been through that before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| and I know much better than that from this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| Counselman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| So you did tell him to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| I told them it was their business decision to be here or not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| So seeing no further lines, there is a second to the motion to defer until the 12-28 regular scheduled billboard meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3193)|
| 0:53:24| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| I think we probably should do a roll call vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Councilman Stabliss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Is there any further business to come before this board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| I was going to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| I was just going to say if you would ask the engineering department maybe to come and give us an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| when we have a light billboard meeting in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| Ms. Pouncey with Top Shelf is here and has the kits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| but I did not see our representative from the drug commission tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| So just no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Please, if you'll come up to the podium and give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| And we're closing in on it, so move pretty quickly, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| Kim Pouncey, 1545 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| I just wanted to quickly say Heather was out with the county doing stings today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| so she called me at the office at 430 and said they were on Asheville Highway, couldn't make it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| so we had to quickly arrange to get kits to my office so I could get them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| So that's why she's not present and why I was late with the kits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| Thank you for that explanation because I had communicated with Ms. Sutton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| and expected her to be here, and thank you very much for pinch hitting at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| Oh, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101116_201911?start=3296)|
