| 0:00:00| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| Mr. Spencer, I wanted to say thank you for bringing this forward. I follow your posts on the School Matters forum and I appreciate you bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=7)|
| 0:00:18| I hope that you will continue to send us. I thought the PowerPoint was very well done and it educated me on some things that I was not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=18)|
| 0:00:28| Please keep sending us information. Education is probably one of our number one concerns. Commissioner Wright is absolutely correct that it is the school board that sets the policy and standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=28)|
| 0:00:45| We are all huge advocates of the educational system and want to do whatever we can in our roles, whatever we can do to make sure that our students are prepared for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=45)|
| 0:01:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:09| I just want to thank you for making that. It is really hard to get that much information into five minutes. I think you did a very good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=69)|
| 0:01:16| Just for some of the commissioners that may not have had the opportunity to look at your slides, I think it is really unfortunate because the numbers, the graphs, really tell the story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=76)|
| 0:01:30| particularly with the teacher ratio to the central office. You really need to look at his PowerPoint. What you see when you look at it is Blount County is a little on this big, Maryville is about this big, and Maryville has some of the best schools in the state as does Oak Ridge and Knox County is way out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:49| I just wanted to point that out and thank you for making a very good presentation in a very short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| Thank you for both of you. I would just like to add that educational outcome impacts everything. Please remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=115)|
| 0:02:03| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The comments that I made a moment ago were just comments. I was not asking a question. I think we are coming from the same direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=125)|
| 0:02:15| I have taken shots for this country also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| But where we stand right now, I am not taking up for the school board, but I am not saying anything against them either because they are an entity that stands by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=139)|
| 0:02:34| They stand on their own two feet and I believe they are doing the best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| So I appreciate your information to us, but you said you had been to school board. Were you giving us an indication that you were rebuffed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:50| Or were you saying that you, I don't want to put words in your mouth here, you said you have been to school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| I have been to school board for the last three or four months. I will learn how to speak school board if it kills me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=177)|
| 0:03:04| But that is what it is all about is the continued pressing the ball incrementally down the field, if you want to use sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:16| The battle does not end on any particular day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| We just have to keep on working and where this work is taking place that you are talking about is taking place across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=200)|
| 0:03:29| Thank you, Mr. Spencer. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| Thank you very much. Bye-bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Mr. Smitty-Giles, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=214)|
| 0:03:42| Charles Smitty-Giles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| Yes, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Mr. Chairman, would you permit me just a moment to respond to some of the questions and comments that have been made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| I think that is probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my three minutes to the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| I will use less than three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| I simply want to point out to the commission and to the public that we have, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| very clearly delineated our performance objectives in very clear and measurable terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| And if folks will go to our website at knoxschools.org, you will see a list of performance indicators that we have set out for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=257)|
| 0:04:25| They include third-grade proficiency in reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| They include ninth-grade completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| And, yes, they include 190, 90, 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| One hundred percent of our students completing high school, at least 90 percent with a regular diploma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| at least 90 percent of those students taking the ACT, and at least 90 percent of the students taking the ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| scoring a 21 or better on that ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| Mr. Spencer mentioned it may be easier to say an average ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| Yes, it's easier, but educational research indicates that using an average rather than a proportion really masks some important differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=289)|
| 0:04:58| You might have a very wide standard deviation for that average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| which means you have lots of folks who are doing really well on the ACT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| and lots of folks who aren't doing so well on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| So we've defined our progress in terms of a proportion of our students scoring a 21 or better on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| And that's really all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| Commissioner Briggs has a lot on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| I want to just make one comment, and it may be worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| I saw your presentation out of West High School, and also one of your ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| I don't know what ROLI is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| It's one of the senior people gave a presentation out to council of the West Knox homeowners with a handout that had objectives from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:36| And these were very specific objectives on the TCAP or the TCAP equivalents of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=336)|
| 0:05:45| we're at 76 now for the next 10 years, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| It takes us up to 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| You know, I think that addresses some of the questions about specifics, you know, trying to have metrics, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=351)|
| 0:06:00| to measure how we're doing because each year, each two years, you know, we've set a bar that we're going to try to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| I think it would be worthwhile to try to get that and maybe send that as an attachment to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| because I really thought that that's the best piece of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| I like numbers, but I thought that was the best piece of information that I've seen in the last two years, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| you know, about specific objectives on specific tests and where we want to be every year to get to the 190, 90, 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| Do you think you know what I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| I do. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Because I'm not sure we've all seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| And that is, you know, rather than vague goals, it is pretty specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| Very specific. Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| I had a question or two for you, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| You mentioned one aspect of those measurable goals is graduation rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| There's been some fairly significant criticism of that in the education community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| in that graduation rates can be artificially affected by things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=417)|
| 0:07:06| And I'm talking about in my experience in the high school, remedial programs and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| Do you all, would you all, I'm sure you entertain those criticisms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| How does that affect policy as you all start to design your goals, which are supposedly measurable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Well, first of all, the nation is sort of coalescing around the National Governance Association definition of four-year graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| And so the state of Tennessee is moving toward that, which means some slight tweaks to the definition, but not major changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| And we're seeing some progress in our graduation rates in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| You know, part of why we defined our sort of top line headline goal as both a graduation and an ACT outcome is because we want our kids to graduate successfully from high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:59| But we want to make sure that they graduate from high school with the knowledge and skills and competencies that they need to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| So we think the combination of a graduation rate and an ACT score is a way to make sure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| You know, I think the things that we can do to make sure that our kids are successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| if they graduate with a meaningful diploma that's based on high standards and that they demonstrate that they have the knowledge and skills that we expect them to have in order to get that graduation rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=497)|
| 0:08:28| that we think that's fully appropriate and what we want to strive for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| But we've defined our success by both of those metrics in recognition, I guess, in part of kind of the critique that you've just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| Okay, in terms of ACT's, like if we just simply looked at ACT's, one of the assumptions that's been made is that our ACT scores have dropped over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:52| if we just took average ACT's within Knox County schools over a certain period of time, and I couldn't say what the period is, but do you have some data that points to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=532)|
| 0:09:05| We absolutely have data on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| And in fact, up through 2009, our ACT scores were on an upward trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| For the class of 2010, they dropped slightly, a decimal point or two, but we also saw a 33% increase in the number of students taking the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=554)|
| 0:09:25| So our big push, based on 190-90-90, one of those 90s is at least 90% of our students taking the ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| and we've gotten closer to 100% of our students taking the ACT, which we think gives us the opportunity to really look at where all of our kids are on that really important benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:42| So part of what you want to make sure is that when you're looking at an ACT score, that you have full participation so it's a really meaningful score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:50| because that can be one area where you can manipulate an average score is who's taking it and how many kids are taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| So we're getting close to 90-plus percent of our kids taking the ACT now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| We had literally a 33% increase in the number of ACT takers last year, and we saw a decimal point or two decrease in the average score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=601)|
| 0:10:11| But what we saw was an increase in the gross number of students that scored a 21 or better on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:20| Okay, who participates in taking ACT? Is that mandated by state now to all school systems, or is that an option to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=620)|
| 0:10:34| The state has strongly encouraged us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| It would be difficult to mandate every child to take it, but we make every effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| We've had a day for our juniors to take the ACT using the state's financial assistance that the state offers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:49| So we've made every effort to make sure that virtually all of our students take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| So when we try to do comparisons on ACT, how is it possible to really legitimately compare school systems that apply the ACT to different segments of their school population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=652)|
| 0:11:06| It's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to recognize Dr. McIntyre. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| We're still in public forum, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Do we have one more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| We have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| I would, as a personal privilege, request that we do the one more public forum, that we take a five-minute break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| and people know that immediately following that we're going to do ethics committee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| Is that what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Thank you for your three minutes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Mr. Smitty-Giles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| Sorry about that, Mr. Giles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| I didn't see Dr. McIntyre coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| Anything for the children of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| I have three that graduated out of the Knox County system, and one of them has gone on to become an educator, so I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| I'm Charles Smitty-Giles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| I reside at 11426 Sagan Lane, Knox County, Knoxville, Tennessee, in the Solway community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| First of all, I'd like to thank the commissioners for your service to our community and the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| and the sacrifices you make and the time you give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| And I also would like to get a promise from each and every one of you when you go home tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| for the sacrifices they make on your behalf in your absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| I want to address you on one main issue, but I'm going to bring up another issue that really coincides with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:45| The two parts I have today, it's an invitation to an event that will occur in the Solway community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| and the second issue I want to speak to you on is a request to begin a process to have the Highway 62 from the Solway Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=771)|
| 0:13:00| up to the Carnes Split designated as the Veterans Memorial Mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=780)|
| 0:13:08| First of all, let me start with the KIA flag and the POW MIA flag dedication that we're going to have in Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=788)|
| 0:13:17| This is open to all groups that honor and stand for our veteran heroes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| and you're invited to the dedication of the KIA flag and the POW MIA flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| This will be held Sunday afternoon, November the 14th, 2010, at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| The location will be 9001 Oak Ridge Highway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| That's the first choice auto repair and service center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| and they've graciously given us the opportunity to use their parking area on that Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| They're closed on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| The location, it's in Solway, of course, in Highway 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| It's located on the northwest Knox County side at the north end of Pellissippi Parkway going towards Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| I've given you some information there, and it has a map link that can be gotten off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| Actually, we have a Facebook site that has a Facebook event on my Facebook page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=851)|
| 0:14:20| and you can go to that and it will give you additional information for those in the public that want to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| I'd like to ask you, first of all, the KIA flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| That represents KIA is killed in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| And the flag was designed by a gentleman to honor his grandfather who served in World War II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| but now it's a flag that's given to each and every family that has lost a loved one in the battles, all battles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:54| not just the one we're in now against the war on terrorism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| It's a beautiful flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| It's a field of purple with a gold band around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| And in the center of the flag, it has the purple heart, which is awarded to those that pay the ultimate sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:15| Our guest of honor for this will be the Gold Star families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| I guess the proper term is Gold Star mothers, but I always like to include Gold Star families because not only the mothers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| but you have the fathers, the brothers and sisters, and the children as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| So that's one of the flag dedications we'll be having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| The other flag will be the POWMIA, prisoners of war missing in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| This flag will be dedicated in honor and memory of those that are still missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| in honor of the ones that are alive with us today and living in this area, not only Knox County, but in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| And so I invite you to attend this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| It's a wonderful opportunity for all people to come together to show these families that we will never forget them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| And you don't have to be a veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| In fact, I encourage people that aren't veterans to step up and show our veterans, you know, how much we care about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=973)|
| 0:16:22| A lot of the situations, a lot of the events that are planned are planned by veterans and they've done their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:31| It's up to us that haven't served to come forward and stand for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Mr. Giles, you have one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| The next item was the request, and I will approach you later on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| would be in designating the section of highway between the Solway Bridge and the split that goes to Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| We have the American flags flying in that boulevard now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| and we're requesting that that would be named the Veterans Memorial Mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| I've met with Representative Ryan Haynes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| and he's on board to sponsor when the session comes back in January up in the state to have this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| The request has to be submitted, of course, by the mayor and the county board of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| So I'm requesting you all to put that on your mind, and I'll come back at a later date to present that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| So thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Thank you, Mr. Giles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| We're going to take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| We'll be back at 345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:36| All right, clerk, what's next on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1056)|
| 0:17:54| A motion to approve the minutes from five different meetings, from special call meetings, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| and a regular meeting from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:36| Okay, we're on elections and appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Resolution 111 is ratifying the Knox County mayor's appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| and two additional appointments to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| Has the mayor's office made their selection on Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1129)|
| 0:19:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Have we made your appointment on the Ethics Committee yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| No, the mayor has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| He has accepted resumes and letters of interest through this past Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| and is taking those into account, although he is in a position for this appointment to simply make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| But he did extend it to the public, so he's wanting to gather those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| He has those in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| He's looking through those as well as other individuals that he is speaking with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| and he'll make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| But he does not want to make it until he's had a chance to read through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| I think there's been about 11 individuals who have put forward their interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| So you need that part postponed 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| I'm assuming that some of these 11 will probably be on our list of 22 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| They may or may not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| We need to make two appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| We'll do the first slot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| I was contacted over the weekend by two individuals and they asked for their name to come off of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| Who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| And that would be number three, Kathy Bryant, wanted to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| And Catherine Brown has withdrawn, number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| And then number ten, John Mark Hancock, wanted to recuse himself from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| I'm sorry I was late coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| There are a few late applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| Are they on our list or are we excluding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| There are some folks that are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| Anybody can be nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| It doesn't have to come from that deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| So if they're here and they want to be nominated or considered for nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| is there anybody in the audience that's not on our list that wants to be considered for nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| Come down and state your name, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| My name is Cortland Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| I'm at 309 Stone Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| Cortland Lewis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| I go by Cort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| And I sent my resume, I believe, on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| Is there any questions of Mr. Lewis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Yeah, Mr. Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| Now, why were you late at sending it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Well, I received a phone call from Elaine Davis in a statement that they were still accepting applications until Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| And then she provided me with e-mails, and I sent that in Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| So to my knowledge, I was on time, but it was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| Had you applied previously to the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| I did, I applied last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| So you went through the full process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| Did you interview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| I did not interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| I wasn't able to attend the meeting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| So because of that, my name was removed for missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Anybody else in the audience that's not on the list that wanted to be nominated or choose to be nominated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| My name is Jim McEvers, 12630 Early Road, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| Yes, my wife and I were vacationing in Georgia over the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| Also, Elaine Davis had sent me an e-mail suggesting that my wife and I submit, resubmit our information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:38| And I didn't send it to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| I sent it to the mayor's office and the individual commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| So, therefore, you have both of our resumes and a cover letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| So we would like to be considered that we didn't know the actions that had taken place before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| What's your wife's name, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Donna, D-O-N-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| D-O-N-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| And, as I say, I think both of our resumes and our cover letter should be in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| I mean, not in the packets, but we sent them to you individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1392)|

| 0:31:42| The pass wish to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| We didn't have a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Nine people voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Does anybody have any questions of the two candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| I'd like to have them come to the podium for two minutes and ask why they would want to be on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| What can they bring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Mr. Drevick, if you'll come forward first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1916)|
| 0:32:05| About three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Steve Drevick, 5801 Meadow Glen Drive in Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| I appreciate the opportunity to speak here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| I was here last week, but I know not all of the members were here for the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| Primarily, I think the strongest case I would like to make for myself on the Ethics Commission has been my work background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:30| My company does a lot of work with agencies, state agencies, local agencies, county agencies, all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:38| So as part of that, I'm constantly exposed to the ethics requirements and the rules and guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| and the internal policy of all of these different county agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| So I think having that kind of exposure to different things that work, different things that don't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| and how other counties and municipalities have implemented their ethics guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| I think it brings a unique set of skills to the Ethics Commission should I be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| Of course, running a business as well, I'm very familiar with general personnel guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:15| things like that that have to be done to be in compliance with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| So that's, of course, another piece of experience that I bring to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| What I would like to see, and one of the goals, not just to be on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| but I see we've started off and we've made a very good set of our new ethics policy is a very good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| We've started off very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| I do see a couple of refinements that I'd like to bring to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| In some cases, some, I guess, ambiguities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| I've seen in other counties that reducing ambiguities within the guidelines is kind of the next most helpful step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:56| In some other agencies, I've seen other employees where a particular set of ambiguities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| for example, in our policy guidelines we say, for example, a gift from a vendor, quote, of any value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| and I've seen it become very helpful to even just put a dollar amount on that value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| That way people know exactly where the line is, and it provides them clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| provides them confidence that they can go and do their jobs properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| and as well prevents the Ethics Commission from being used as any kind of a political tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| I think it makes it safe for everyone around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| And I think the Ethics Commission could do a very strong job of both educating the employees within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| as well as educating the community in general about how this big step that we've taken forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| and the steps that we are taking forward and be used as an instrument to further enhance the confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| the growing confidence that the citizens have in the county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| Dr. Briggs, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| I know I haven't talked to you, and some of the other people have talked to members of the present ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:06| Have you talked to anyone else on the committee about things that we've done, or, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| do you know anyone on the committee right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| No, not, I mean, I'm vaguely familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| I've talked to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| I've met Elaine Davis, but as far as their duties on the committee, no, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| You weren't asked to serve on there by anyone on the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| No, I was not called or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| I just, the last time there was an opening, I believe I applied for that, and it's been a continuing interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| Mr. Morgan, or Mr. Lewis, I don't think Mr. Morgan is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| My name is Court Lewis, 309 Stone Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:52| My main goal is just to serve and to give back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| I'm an ethics teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| I teach at Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| I've also taught at the University of Tennessee in several fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| Of course, I wasn't always in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| I spent 10 years in the restaurant business, and there's a lot of stuff that goes on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| so I have practical business experience dealing with vendors and running a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| but also I have theoretical experience because I've studied ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| but because I studied at the University of Tennessee, there's a strong emphasis on applied ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| so actually getting in there, dealing with cases, real-life cases in business, in politics, in medical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:39| So I have a strong background in ethics, understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| I have lots of practical experience dealing with people through my business, and I'm very community-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| I mentor at South Knox Elementary with Kids Hope, which is a branch of Big Brothers Big Sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| I go into Pond Gap Elementary once a month and read to students and discuss books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| I do other things around the community, and so the opportunity to serve on the ethics committee seemed ideal to play off my own strengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:17| and to give back and to help, you know, Knox County achieve its goals and to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:30| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Yes, I have the same question, you know, that I asked Mr. Drabik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| Do you know or I think you said Elaine Davis called you or what's the relationship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| There really is no relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| I received a phone call, I believe on Wednesday, because I applied last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| and she said that since I had shown interest in the past that I should consider applying again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| That's all the contact I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| I'll ask you this because I've already asked Mr. Drabik this last week when he was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Do you have any members of your family that work for Knox County Government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| Last call, Mr. Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| We'll be voting between Morgan, Drabik, and Lewis, starting in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Drabik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Commissioner Broyles votes for Mr. Drabik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2308)|

| 0:43:54| and I think it might have been up to 30 at one time, of interested citizens who have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| And I would just like to applaud each and every one of them for their willingness to take a part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| I mean, you go back two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| we had to practically go out on the street to try to find somebody to put on some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| So thank you all who did apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2653)|

| 0:45:23| Resolution 113 is appointing an alternate member on the Knox County Sheriff's Office Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:32| We'll do this the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| I had my nomination and I've lost it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| We'll start taking nominations in the 1st or the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Can we have someone explain to us, you know, I have a vague idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| but exactly what the Sheriff's Merit System Council does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| Sheriff, do you want to do it or do you want me to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2755)|
| 0:46:05| Could you state your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| I'm Gary Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| I'm the Executive Director of the Sheriff's Merit System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| I reside in Merrill, 22351 Riverside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| Basically, the Sheriff's Merit System Council is a three-person council with one alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| that is appointed by the county commission that is, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| a civil service board for the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| The staff that I supervise takes applications, qualifies those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:45| or disqualifies those based on the background investigation work that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| and then present the Sheriff with an eligibility list that he then interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| and makes hiring decisions on after the completion of a year of probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| That employee then comes under the protection, if you will, of the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| Then they have grievance rights to the Merit Council if they disagree with actions taken by the Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| that they deem detrimental to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| We also administer and maintain eligibility lists for tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:26| and eligibility lists for promotions within the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| Dr. Briggs, does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2852)|

| 0:47:35| Does anybody else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| There were two resumes in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| So I believe this is an either or, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| Mr. Jarrett, do we have to pick one of the two or can somebody else nominate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| I'm sorry, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| On the Merit Council there's two applications or there's two resumes on the agenda quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| Do we have to pick from those or can anybody appoint outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| No, I mean, those are the two you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| If you have other nominations, you can certainly entertain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| Does anybody wish to nominate outside the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| I know I have William Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2896)|

| 0:48:19| Roy Cruz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| I'd like to nominate Roy Cruz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2900)|

| 0:48:27| I'm sorry, who's the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| Dr. William Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Dr. William Lindsey and who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| Now there's another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=2914)|

| 0:58:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Maybe I can save some time in this just to ask if anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| I'll be happy to go into it a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| But I think most everybody is pretty much on board with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| I think, as I mentioned last week at the workshop, this is a fantastic windfall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| opportunity for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| And thanks to all of you who have agreed to kind of participate in the kickoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| We've still got a couple that haven't yet, but I'm hoping they will be for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| And we'll be invited to that at Blount Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| You speak about that $100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Joe Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| And him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| Roddy Mache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| And all I'd like to say is that this is, I don't know, as we look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| and this is one of those issues that kind of butts up against the hillside issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| for us, the preservation of these sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| There's three of them, three forts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| And it potentially could be a game changer in Knoxville and Knox County in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| of what's called, I think, historical tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| And it's a very, we have a, for those of you that are into the Civil War,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| and I'm not, I'm not really an aficionado of Civil War history or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| but the more I read about it, the more fascinated I am with our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| And it's an opportunity, I think, for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| So I hope we participate as much as we can in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| Well, the list that, does everybody have a copy of the list of the proposed members of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| I'm going to pass them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| I'm hoping everybody has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| These are a bunch of pretty heavy hitters, and they're all into the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| They all have agreed to be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| This commission will be more of a clearinghouse, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| They want to bring in, this is not every person who will be involved in this promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| and we're talking about a four-year deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| This will be, they will take information from any group that has an activity planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| and try to correlate them together and promote them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| If Gloria Ray from Knoxville Tourism, for instance, can go out now and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| this is what we're going to have for you when you bring your bowling tournament here in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| Stay a couple extra days, and here's a long list with a map of things you can do while you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| Look at the dollars that are going to be rolling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| So it's a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Remember to visit the reenactment of the Battle of Fort Sanders at the far end of House Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Ordinance on second reading, O-10-9-103,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| is amending the Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 8, Division 2, Section 2-496,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| relative to the composition and terms of the members of the Knox County Investment Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| This amends Ordinance O-05-6-104, adopted July 25, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:53| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| I'll hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3720)|

| 1:02:09| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| We need to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Is there anybody else here for public forum that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| On the other business, we have the discussion, the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| We've set up a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| Anyone have any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| Commission's meeting structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Today we voted on as a rules committee to structure the agenda and do some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| Those will be before you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| I think most of you all were in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Does anybody have any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| Mr. Chairman, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Is there a date on that November thing yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| Is there a date on the zoning workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| We just met last week with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| We're trying to coordinate that to make sure that we cover everything because there's some hyper technical issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| but we are working towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| Anything on the discussion of rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| Are we talking right now about possible changes in our schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| It's more of the structure of the agenda than it is a change in the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Would a discussion of moving zonings up 30 minutes, would that be appropriate right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:36| Just as a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| It's appropriate to discuss the meeting structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Well, given the way things are going and our great efficiency in this new system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| it looks like we're having these rather long interludes where we don't have anything to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| And I like you guys and everything, but I like my family more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| And so I don't see that 530 for zonings would be a tremendous hardship on people that want to come to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:10| So that would be something that I think we need to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| That will have to come before rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| Meeting schedules, everybody's clear on the meeting schedule for November and December?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| The November meeting is at Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| We're still working the logistics out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| We're going to eat lunch at Fulton with the administrators and some staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| That's the third Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| Is that correct, Jolie, the third Monday in November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| Fifteenth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| It's the eighth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| The workshop is on the eighth and the session is on the fifteenth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Any other odds on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| Today we also in the rules committee we talked about agenda item deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| We're keeping the deadline the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| We're going to vote next month to either keep the deadline the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| but move the finance department would like an extra week of deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| with Jolie to put the transfers in there, line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| I'm totally in agreement with having the same old cutoff dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| because we need the time to get the information to make sure that it's in a written format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| when we have our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| We can't continue to receive verbal agenda items on the day of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| And really we shouldn't be taking verbal commission items even on committee day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| or whatever you want to call it, workshop day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| So I'm fully supportive of moving toward having everything written by the deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3953)|
| 1:06:02| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| The only thing, I had a comment about the Fulton High School meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| I do like meeting in the community some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| but I'd warn that we need to be careful about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| that there are other scheduled committee meetings that precede this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| and sometimes that's a hardship for those that are on other committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| and then they've got to go out and travel to some other location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| So just keep that in mind when we do this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| Also, beer board has to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| Also, some of our department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| and others that are to speak before the commission that day kind of puts a hardship on them to go out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| Will the beer board be here or at Fulton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| Last week is going to be Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| The beer board will be at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| We're coming back here for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| Or the agenda item applicants or whoever is affected will be notified of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| Any other discussion inside the discussion items or the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| We are adjourned until zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Recess until zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:20| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| I'm back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4044)|

| 1:07:30| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4050)|

| 1:07:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4052)|

| 1:07:34| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4054)|

| 1:07:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| His papers are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| His papers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| In spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:53| The first agenda item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| The first item is 8-A-10-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| It's a request of Joe G. Tate for Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment from LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| Low Density Residential to GC General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| The property is located on the south side of Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| east side of Metal Run Lane in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| Buzz, do you want to go ahead and present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| It's a request that actually what you have before you today is a request for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:36| The accompanying rezoning did not follow because it was recommended for denial by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| It was not appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| But in the case of the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| the applicant was requesting amendment of the sector plan from Low Density Residential to General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| The property is located at the intersection of Oak Ridge Highway and Metal Lark Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| right in the middle of the Carnes community there east of the intersection of Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:10| and Byington Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| The staff in making their recommendation and then the planning commission in confirming the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| looked at the location of the property at the intersection of an arterial roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| and the local street that actually serves a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| The property is already zoned OA Office Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| It does have currently a low density residential plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| The staff felt that the request for commercial was not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| The area includes residential, low density residential to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:57| to the east and north more institutional type uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| and then to the west a combination of office and commercial uses, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| oriented around the Byington Beaver Ridge-Oak Ridge Highway intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| Admittedly, there is commercial zoning to the east of this property as well as to the north of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| But these are uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| The uses of the property can also be permitted under the office plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| When the sector plan was last updated and amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| it did not recognize that commercial zoning because we felt like the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| we felt like the commercial zoning was not appropriate to the east of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| There is other vacant commercial property in the general area that can be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| and probably should be before additional property is recommended for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| Again, the intersection location, we'd rather see commercial uses at an intersection of an arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4258)|
| 1:11:06| and or a collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| And since the last time this came through, where MPC also recommended denial of the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4268)|
| 1:11:16| we have not seen changes in the area that justify reconsideration of a commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| So what you have, again, is you have the planning commission to make the sector plan consistent with the current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:31| recommended the sector plan change to O office, and then recommended denial of the applicant's request for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4291)|
| 1:11:43| well, instead of recommending for general commercial, they recommended O office, the office designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| and then recommend denial of the request for CA general business zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| Now, this is another situation where you can, your first option is to ratify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4315)|
| 1:12:03| or support the recommendation of the planning commission by recommending office plan designation on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:12| If you choose, after you hear testimony today, if you choose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| and you want to allow consideration of a commercial plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| then you would have to initiate that request and that would have to go back to the planning commission based upon the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| and the change in state law, which occurred a year or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| So today you cannot approve, at least in our opinion, you cannot approve a commercial plan designation or the commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:42| You have to initiate that plan designation to come back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| and we would also reconsider the commercial zoning at that time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| But you can, however, support the plan, the recommendation from the planning commission as before you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:58| which is to only change the plan designation to office, which is consistent with the current OA office park zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4378)|
| 1:13:11| The applicant, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| My name is Joe Tate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| I live at 1031 North Cedar Bluff Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| What's currently on the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Well, I did have a beauty salon, but they have moved, and so it's an empty building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| Which beauty salon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| I'm trying to figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| It was Matias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Okay, so they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| I looked up to the other, to Bluebell Lane, which is very similar to this meadow run in that they put a sonic at the entrance of a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:57| which I thought, you know, I should have an opportunity to do the same thing, but I guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4437)|
| 1:14:06| So you're seeking, what were you seeking to put there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| It looks like I'm in a corner here, and I'm going to have to just go with OA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| It looks like if I go back, it's going to be round robin again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| It's going to be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| You're seeking the zone change for the plan sector amendment change to go to O?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Yeah, he already has OA office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| What the action today is, is to change the sector plan to office to be consistent with the current office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4469)|
| 1:14:39| So he already has OA zoning, but based on what the planning commission considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| they chose to bring the plan into conformity with the current office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| But you didn't, so you've got to go back to MPC to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| I'm just tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Make a motion we approve according to MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| Is there any opposition in the crowd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| Mr. Tate, what are you wanting to put?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| Were you going to tear that building down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| What I wanted to do was build a restaurant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| But, you know, like three years ago, I had unanimous approval from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:26| And then we got to the commission, and Mark Kaywood shot me down, and I couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| So I thought, well, Mr. Kaywood is no longer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| It might be a good opportunity to do something good for the community, you know, help America get moving again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| That's what I do, is make jobs and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| But then I went back to MPC this time, and it was unanimous disapproval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| And so, you know, I don't know what to do except just accept it and go on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| You know, I'm 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| I'm just running out of steam here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| What size restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| I mean, give me an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Well, you know what Gondolier is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Something similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| But they're gone now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| I had them three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| But they're gone now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| I'd have to start all over, which, you know, it's not impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| But it just seems to me, this little community here, this little subdivision is about ten houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:21| My wife and I own the two front parcels, and they're both empty right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| And it's an area that's in transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| Half of the houses are rental properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| And I see it in the future as being like for architects, doctors, that kind of professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4595)|
| 1:16:43| A lot of the older people are just dying out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| So it just seemed to me that with the large commercial area contiguous with this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| that it would just be a slam dunk to develop something nice there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| And eventually I wanted to get with Mike, who owns the other property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| and put the two together and try to develop something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| that the community would be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| But, you know, here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| I don't know what to do except accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| So how many of those houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| You own some of those houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| I own the front two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| And you're going to tear those down and put a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| The one on the other side is zoned office, and I don't want to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| I just want the one that's contiguous with the commercial already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| The two need to be together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| It just seems to me to develop that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| You need all of that to be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| But that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| I did a shopping center at Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| Had a lot of opposition from Belmont West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| And Mr. Lutho, who was commissioner at that time, he could see the dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| And today I have something really nice out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| I don't know if you all know about it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| I've got a nice shopping center, which MPC gave me an award for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| And everything I do is nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| It's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| It's upscale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| And I just wanted to do something, you know, for the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| My wife and I have had a daycare center there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| But we just can't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| But anyway, I'm rambling on here, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Well, I just, you know, knowing from what you and your wife have done, you all do first-class work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| You do, I think it's Tate School Discovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| And you all are great to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4721)|

| 1:19:15| It's a request of David Wells for rezoning from A Agricultural to RA Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| The property is located on the southwest side of Catlett Road, northwest of Allen Ridge Lane in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4760)|

| 1:19:55| Buzz, do you have an MPC report for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| The Planning Commission recommended approval of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4800)|

| 1:20:12| It is to rezone from Agricultural to RA Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| It is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| As identified in the northwest county sector plan, it's also in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| It's approximately one acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4829)|

| 1:20:41| and the Planning Commission on their consent calendar also recommended approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4841)|

| 1:21:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=4864)|

| 1:23:21| Mr. Seymour, would you like to name an address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:33| I have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| I've discussed it with Mr. Donaldson at MPC and you briefly, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| Section 4.103.13 says that a business license required each vendor shall obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5023)|
| 1:23:52| and display a business license obtained from the Knox County clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| Last year, the state legislature amended the taxing law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| and requires the operator to charge each vendor a dollar a day for a booth in the market place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:15| And I would suggest rather than that specific language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| you all just put in that the operator will comply with TCA 67-4-710.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:27| The reason I think the state did this was for ease of collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| If you have one guy collecting the tax rather than chasing 20, 30, or 40 vendors, it makes it a lot simpler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5073)|
| 1:24:41| We made that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| I think we made the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| You may not have a new copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| We made that change to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Oh, you did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| It now reads that the flea market operator shall obtain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| And should it not reference state law because it's got a specific procedure on TCA 67-4-710.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5091)|
| 1:25:02| It regulates how flea markets and antique malls collect taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| Well, I mean, we can, you know, there wouldn't be a substantive change if the commission wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| We could add big tax license required per Tennessee Code section and that would not change the substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:21| We can still move forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| I think that's fine rather than set up a separate procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| Just follow state law and that would, I mean, state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| obviously what they're doing is going after the big guy to collect it if you want to chase all the booth holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| He's the one that's responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| I'm fine with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| That section and some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| and I did not mean to get involved in a discussion today with the codes people about flea markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| but, well, and I guess I should say Roy Braden asked me several questions about what was going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5157)|
| 1:26:05| And he seemed to have some difficulty with maybe unintended consequences related to flea markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| So I know we've discussed whether it should be five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| Now we're off into a side discussion of how long will a flea market reside in a certain place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5179)|
| 1:26:28| and they have to have lighting and shrubbery consistent with other parts of the zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:38| And I don't know if a person is going to take a four or five acre plot that might be usable for a flea market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| and do it for a year maybe thinking they could be there for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| Having to do all this up front work may put them off from doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| because then the vegetation might be changed with whoever has the property a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| In other words, there's a lot of up front with some of the things that we've got built into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:11| I'm really not comfortable with where this may be sitting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| I'd really like to postpone, offer a substitute motion to postpone for another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| And this time I'll really have to dig into it and bring some other things about code enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:32| because, as I say, there are things that code administration is going to have trouble with enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5252)|
| 1:27:41| The main thing I need to say is that I'm in total agreement with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| about what I observed more than a month ago on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| We can't allow this kind of operation on the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5268)|
| 1:27:55| In fact, that was one of the things that was brought up in my esteemed 7th District location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5275)|
| 1:28:03| On, for example, 33 Highway as you approach Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| people just come in on the now defunct grocery store grass and set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| And they do it for that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| What we're regulating may not fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| I mean, they'll still come and set up for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| You run them off tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| Well, next week it's somebody else that comes and does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| We need something that it's easier to enforce getting people off the right of way, for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| I believe we've solved the issue of who's going to collect a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:46| I don't know how we deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| I have had one call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| It's from a 501C3 that operates a flea market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| And they do their operation strictly to raise money to give away at the next Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5339)|
| 1:29:06| And he said that the way he reads what's being offered right now, he would not be able to operate what he operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5346)|
| 1:29:13| Where's his located at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| Somewhere in 8th District, I assume, on one of the Highway 11s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5356)|
| 1:29:29| Maybe one of the things that we need further discussion on is saying that they can only operate three days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| and we preclude them from being there for four other days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Yes, four other days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| How does that play with, I know we discussed, I think it's Mr. Whaley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5383)|
| 1:29:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| Mr. Ashley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| How often is he open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| He didn't object to the three-day requirement, so I assume max three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| Now, his is in Sevier County, but he's opening one in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| And the tax, town of Farragut would regulate the land use, but the collections would be to the Knox County court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5406)|
| 1:30:17| So that's, Knox County would still get the revenue from the business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| I don't, I can certainly check on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| I would assume, except for holiday weekends like July the 4th, typically three days would be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| Yeah, I think that my concern in this ordinance was not to inhibit somebody from doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:44| That was, you know, when you say flea markets, I mean, there used to be one there at the old drive-in on Asheville Highway that was very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5444)|
| 1:30:56| That's not, the roadside is what the hindrance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| That's the thing that's getting us right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| And there are certain instances, such as just up Clinton Highway, there's an agricultural on the roadside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:10| But it's ag stuff in an ag zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| Right, but with this, I'm glad you mentioned that because that was exactly Roy Braden's example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5473)|
| 1:31:21| or my example to him was a fellow in the agricultural business having a trailer load of watermelons in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:29| He can do that in an ag zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Only if he grows them on his ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| See, now we've got into I don't know kinds of stuff and it's an unintended consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:44| Is there a second on the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| Do you want to discuss any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| Any further discussion on voting now on a 30-day deferment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| That's probably a 21-day deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| It will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Next meeting, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part2?start=5537)|
