| 0:00:00| Alright, thank you. I'll call this meeting to order of Knoxville City Council. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| Tuesday, June 23rd, 2015. I appreciate everybody who is here in the audience and anybody who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=5)|
| 0:00:12| might be watching from home. We'll start with the invocation given by Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=12)|
| 0:00:19| and the Pledge of Allegiance will be led by Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=19)|
| 0:00:23| Mayor, I think as we start tonight, I think it would be appropriate to take a moment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=23)|
| 0:00:28| silence for the nine victims in Charleston, South Carolina. And after an appropriate amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=28)|
| 0:00:33| of time, I'll close in prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=33)|
| 0:00:44| God, there is no greater concern on our hearts than for there to be peace in our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=44)|
| 0:00:50| for the protection of our police officers, for us as human beings to find solutions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| conflicts in a peaceful and reasonable manner, to resolve our differences as we respect our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=54)|
| 0:01:00| neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| We pray tonight to you, oh God, grant us the desires of our heart as we ask for these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| for our city and for our country. Protect those who can't protect themselves, feed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| clothe, and shelter those who can't help themselves. And we pray tonight for wisdom for the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| before us that you grant us that insight. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=83)|
| 0:01:30| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=90)|

| 0:01:54| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| Okay, is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Any opposed? The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Mayor, we have on second reading tonight 9E, which is the urban agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| And since the last council meeting, I've had several constituents contact me with some concerns about different components of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=140)|
| 0:02:29| I think that council as a whole probably needs to have a little bit better understanding of some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| I've had some questions come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Of course, clarification, what's allowed, how it's going to be enforced, what happens when we have a drought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=158)|
| 0:02:48| people stop watering their lawn and it dries up, I mean their garden and it dries up, hoop houses are abandoned and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| I think there are some questions that we as council need to have answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| Another one that came up, can you have a garden in your front yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| So I believe that it would behoove us to postpone this, have a workshop, and Vice Mayor Pavlis I think can address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=182)|
| 0:03:13| and then consider this again in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| I would like to meet with some of my neighborhood groups specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| and I know that Erin has spent a lot of time with different people who are interested in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| but I also know that I have heard from people who just kind of found out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| And so I would like to ask that we postpone this for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| I was just going to reiterate what Councilman Palmer has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| I've had several phone calls in the last week since this came really known in the newspapers type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| and so I would also second your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| There's some concerns in terms of what we're talking about, setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| special concern about the sheds that would sell the fruit or the vegetables or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| And so there are all of a sudden, unfortunately it's like so many issues that we get down to the wire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| and then people come forward and it's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| But I do know that several of the neighborhoods that I represent are interested in finding out more about it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| So I would support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| And we're fine to provide as much information as you need to discuss the issues before you vote on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| So that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| So we have a motion and a second on postponing 9E, which is the urban ag ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| So are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| That is postponed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| Anything else to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| For the consent items, we have 11I through J, certificates of compliance, and 11K to L for pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=288)|
| 0:04:57| And 12D through K for 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| The ayes have it and those are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| I want to first thank Councilman Wallace for the moment of silence in memory of the lives that were lost in Charleston last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=310)|
| 0:05:21| And I just wanted to say a few words about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Obviously, a lot has already been said and written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| But when a tragedy like this happens anywhere, even as our hearts and prayers go out to those who are suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| it causes all of us to reflect on our own communities, our own cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| And you all know we had a shooting in a church here in Knoxville not too many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| And the shock and the damage of that day still reverberate through many families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| And I'm sure they were especially affected by the terrible news from Charleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| Make sure we live it all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| So I just want to reaffirm my commitment, a commitment that I know is shared by Council and across this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| to embrace our diversity, to celebrate both our shared values and our cultural differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| and also to recognize the difficult chapters in our own history and to work in the present to remedy the wounds of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=367)|
| 0:06:15| I know we will all keep the members of Emanuel AME Church and the people of Charleston in our thoughts and in our prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| And you all know I was at the U.S. Conference of Mayors and Mayor Joe Riley is normally there for our conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| And, in fact, we honored him in his absence, though, because that's his last conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| He's no longer, after 40 years, he is not running for re-election as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| But he was on speakerphone to us to talk about the experience in his community and how they were dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| So we all sent our concerns from the cities across the country from the mayors on behalf of all of our citizens to the people of Charleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=407)|
| 0:06:57| So I know we'll all keep the members of the church and the people of Charleston in our thoughts and prayers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| So for those who can't attend, tomorrow there will be a prayer service, tomorrow night at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| That's Wednesday at 6 p.m. at Bethel AME Church, which is located at 3811 Boyd's Bridge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| This is being organized by Reverend Daryl Arnold from Overcoming Believers and other churches to really mark the one-week anniversary of the shootings and to pray for everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=438)|
| 0:07:32| So, again, that is tomorrow night at Bethel AME, 6 o'clock at 3811 Boyd's Bridge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| Okay, so moving on, I want to remind everyone that our annual festival on the 4th at the World's Fair Park is fast approaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| Festivities begin at 4 p.m. on Saturday, July 4th with musical performances and kids' activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=467)|
| 0:07:55| At 5 p.m. we will have a reprise of the tug-of-war contest between members of the Knoxville Police Department and Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=475)|
| 0:08:07| And I presume you've all been training hard for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| That's at 5 o'clock for anyone who wants to witness that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| The Knoxville Symphony Orchestra will begin its performance at 8 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| And you all know that's always a great occasion, a mix of patriotic and Americana pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| And it will lead up to the fireworks finale, which is about 9.40 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| And there's a new twist this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| They tell us you can watch the fireworks show in 3-D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| We always thought it was 3-D, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| But there's going to be 3-D glasses that we're handing out for a special enhanced way of looking at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| And you can get the 3-D glasses at the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| The Office of Special Events staff will be handing them out while supplies last at the information booth at the base of the Clinch Avenue viaduct there where the information booth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=535)|
| 0:09:05| You're evoking Dr. Timothy Leary from the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=549)|

| 0:09:28| And finally, for my report, I want to invite our urban forester, Casey Krause, to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=568)|
| 0:09:36| He has recently, I believe he's got some tree board members here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| He has recently completed our first ever report on the state of the urban forest in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| And we're going to be passing out copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| And I see Sam Adams is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Sam, are you the chair of the tree board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| So, Sam, are you starting off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| I'm starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Why don't you state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| And we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| I'm Sam Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| I live in Stone Oak Lane, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| Good evening, Mayor O'Hara, members of the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| As the current chair of Knoxville Tree Board, and speaking for the board, I'd like to thank you for your service in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| And also for providing us, the members of the tree board, the opportunity to serve you, the city of Knoxville, and specifically our urban forester, Casey Krause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=619)|
| 0:10:30| And his staff in the urban forestry division of the public services department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| I'm happy to be here sharing the podium with Casey to report on the state of our urban forest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| and proud that the report you are about to hear is one that speaks to a vision of Knoxville that is growing and dynamic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| just like the trees we're all sharing stewardship over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| The Knoxville Tree Board has recently been working on reviewing and evaluating the status of three documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| that have been produced to provide various guiding policies, management plans, and implementations for the city of Knoxville regarding trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=659)|
| 0:11:10| These documents are as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| Urban Forest Management Plan, dated 2011, not adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Knoxville-Knox County Tree Conservation and Management Plan, adopted June 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| And the City of Knoxville Tree Master Plan, adopted January 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| In our review of these documents, it became apparent to us that each of these plans was relevant in its own way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| and at the same time somewhat redundant, since each had recommendations for similar policies and programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| Our progress report is the result of reviewing each of these documents, evaluating the relevance of each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=704)|
| 0:11:53| and determining which goals have been achieved, such as performing a street tree inventory management plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| and hiring an urban forester, which we're really proud to have as part of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| And which goals need to be updated to match with the current state of the urban forestry program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| As you will see in our report, this evaluation and analysis has produced a set of goals and action items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| to provide guidance to Casey as he moves the urban forestry program forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| and still be a dynamic document that will continue to be evaluated and updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| to ensure a progressive and well-managed urban forest for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| To conclude, I'd like to give a shout-out to our city trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| They perform yeoman service to our community by cooling our streets and neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| cleaning our air, and reducing runoff to our rivers and streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| But I'd also like to remind you, as stewards of the fiscal well-being of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| that there are few things that you can buy and put into service for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| that we'll appreciate and value immediately the way that trees do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| Trees are a wise investment for today and tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| I want to thank you for your continued willingness to invest in trees for Knoxville and in Knoxville's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Thank you, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| And are there other members of the tree board who are here you want to introduce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Would you all please stand if you're a member of the tree board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| Let's see. I'm going to look around just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| We've got Craig Walker and David Vandegrift, former chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| All right. Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Okay, Casey. Thanks, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| Thank you, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Casey Krause, urban forester for the city of Knoxville, 6029 Glen May Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| Mayor and council members, thank you for the opportunity to allow me to give you a quick update on the state of the city's urban forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=820)|
| 0:13:49| Knoxville is blessed to be located in the heart of the Appalachian and Blue Ridge forests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| one of the most diverse and, in my opinion, beautiful areas in the entire world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| In 2014, the city, in partnership with the state of Tennessee Division of Forestry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| did a tree canopy assessment throughout the entire city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| and determined that our city is made up of almost 40 percent tree cover citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| To put this number into perspective, the national average for tree canopy coverage in cities across the U.S. is around 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=858)|
| 0:14:28| Many cities across the U.S. have developed 20- to 30-year extensive tree planting campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| in order to restore the tree canopy coverage to levels similar to where Knoxville currently stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| These communities, like Knoxville, understand that urban forests are a dynamic ecosystem that improves air quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| reduces storm water, cleaning our water supply, cools our cities, saving us money on our utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| and complements smart growth while building a vibrant community where people want to live and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| However, now more than ever, our urban forest is under threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| In 2010, emerald ash borer, also known as EAB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| a destructive green bug native to Asia that feeds on our native ash trees, was discovered in east Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| Five years later, our ash tree population is starting to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| For example, in the past three months, the city has removed more ash trees across Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| than we have combined in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| But it's not just emerald ash borer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| We've also seen high populations of sycamore and pin oak trees succumb to bacterial diseases called bacterial leaf scorch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| And our walnut and hemlock trees are also under risk from a disease called thousand canker disease in the hemlock woolly adelgid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| However, Knoxville has not just sat back and watched these pests attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| We are going through our third year of treating ash trees throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| and we continue to diversify our tree population to help prevent catastrophic tree canopy loss in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=961)|
| 0:16:09| Currently, Knoxville has over 170 distinct species of trees throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| with no single species representing over 10% of the tree population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| We are able to obtain tree information like this from our ongoing tree inventory, which to date is about 25% complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=979)|
| 0:16:27| We have partnered with the University of Tennessee on this inventory to help obtain vital information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| such as the size, condition, and location of our public trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| A tree inventory is an essential component to any urban forestry program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| It helps prioritize maintenance, plan future forestry needs, and provide basis for managing our urban forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| Most importantly, the tree inventory is a necessary tool that will move our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| from a reactive to proactive urban forestry program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| In today's world, trees are no longer viewed merely as landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| but as necessary infrastructure to contribute to a wealth of economic, environmental, and social benefits for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| As Sam mentioned, trees are one of the very few investments a city can make that will actually appreciate in value and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| It is my job as urban forester of Knoxville to protect and maintain that investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| and I think we have made tremendous strides in the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| We updated our public tree ordinance in 2014 and redeveloped our tree planting contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| to ensure that Knoxville gets the most suitable trees planted correctly across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| Our mulching and pruning practice have taken a complete turn in the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| as we continue to provide in-house aboriculture training for crews conducting maintenance on public trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| We also continue to educate local contractors and labor landscapers on proper aboriculture practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1070)|
| 0:17:58| but still have a long way to go in order to get many of these individuals to see trees as a vital infrastructure for our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1078)|
| 0:18:07| In 2014, we organized our public service horticulture division to create an urban forestry division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1087)|
| 0:18:16| This division is responsible for the maintenance of all trees along streets and public spaces throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| Our urban forestry division does an excellent job at responding to important and urgent tree-related issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| such as those work orders received through 311 and those emergency calls responding to fallen trees during storm events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1111)|
| 0:18:41| In fact, most of our urban forest resources go towards responding to tree-related issues after an issue has already occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| A successful program should also spend resources on other important but less urgent tasks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| such as proactively pruning and maintaining trees in a cyclical pruning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| Routine maintenance will increase the life expectancy of a tree, improve aesthetics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| and can save the city time and money by reducing the number of reactive emergency calls and requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| Finally, I want to leave you guys with an ongoing urban forestry project that has taken place in the last three years in an East Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1153)|
| 0:19:26| If you could step back in time three years ago and drive the streets of the Park Ridge neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| you would be driving through a neighborhood with one of the lowest percentage of tree cover in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| You'd be staring at stumps and aging unkept trees throughout much of the public space across the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| all remnants of an unhealthy urban forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| Just as vacant and blighted properties can bring down a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| an unkept, underutilized urban forest also detracts from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| It was an active neighborhood organization that approached the city in 2012 that wanted to see more trees planted throughout the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| With the assistance of an ongoing state grant and the mayor's dedication to invest in trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| the city started reforestating many parts of the Park Ridge neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| Today, as you drive through the neighborhood, you can see many young shade, ornamental, and fruit trees thriving within the public planting strip throughout the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1213)|
| 0:20:23| In addition, in the winter of 2014-2015, the city grinded all stumps that were identified during the tree inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1223)|
| 0:20:32| and pruned all trees identified as in need of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| This Park Ridge reforestation project and maintenance project is only one example of how our urban forest is tied to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1237)|
| 0:20:45| and how benefits produced from an urban forest can help promote a more vibrant city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| I invite you all to read the State of the Urban Forest report that I provided for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| and we'll open up to any questions that you guys may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| And, of course, if anything comes up after the meeting, feel free to contact me as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| Thank you, Casey. Any questions for Casey right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| Councilman Dellivoki?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Just a quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| I just want to thank Casey for going out to neighborhood groups and talking about tree planting and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| because, you know, not everyone has that information, and you're dealing with the trees on public property right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| and we all can be a part of keeping trees healthy in our own yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| So I appreciate you sharing the knowledge you have about tree planting, tree maintenance, and how to do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| My intention is that the city kind of leads by example, and hopefully that resonates with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1299)|
| 0:21:47| Great. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| No other questions tonight, but I'm sure after everybody reads it, they might have a question for you and give you a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| I think it's a good report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Again, thank you, Casey, for everything you and your team is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| and thanks to the tree board, all the members who participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1322)|

| 0:25:41| of 25 lots before they can be permitted to have a subdivision identification sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| In this case, the gentleman is developing a subdivision with 11 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| I believe that's the number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Well, in this particular case, the zoning ordinance requires that a subdivision have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| a minimum of 25 lots before they can be permitted to have a subdivision identification sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| In this case, the gentleman is developing a subdivision with 11 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| I believe that's the number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| And we'd like to be able to put a subdivision identification sign at the front of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1556)|
| 0:26:04| So the ordinary rule is you got to have a big subdivision before you can get an identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| That's what you have to have larger than what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| and I've talked to David Harbin and the gentleman who's actually constructing this subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| and do you want to speak or do you want me to go ahead and move to approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| I should tell you we do have two people who've asked to speak in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1590)|

| 0:26:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| I'm sorry, David Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| I couldn't read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| I'm the developer of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| It's my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| I'm the developer, mayor, and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Once you go right ahead, I'm going to set my timer, and by council rules, state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes, and we appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Carl Perry, and my address is 2012 Serendica Way, and that's off of Governor Jones Superior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1614)|
| 0:27:03| Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| I grew up in this area, this church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| My home church is right up the street from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| We have several buyers already to come in there, and they've asked me why we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1630)|
| 0:27:17| have 25 lots to have a sign, and they want to direct people to their house, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| got a nice area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| I've got a half a million dollars spent in that project, and I would love to have a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| monument sign put up to designate where that subdivision is in case people want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| in to visit their homeowners, their children, and the families in the subdivision, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| would sure appreciate it if we could get this passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Do you want to hear the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Mr. Harbin, do you want to speak, or do you want me to go ahead and speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| When this came to BZA, there were four members present at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| Two people voted to approve his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Two people didn't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| They have to have three of the five before they can approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| So this appeal is coming to us because BZA didn't have enough members present, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| to say yay or nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| I have talked to some people in the district who live near there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| I have had no opposition, and so I would like to move that we approve this appeal tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| I also want to just reiterate what Councilwoman Palmer has to say, is that I checked around to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| and there's absolutely no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| There's actually been no contact for those in favor or those against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| So I think it's one of those kind of things with BZA in terms of not having enough people there to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| There was no opposition at MPC either on this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| And I think that this will be a good development for that particular section of Pleasant Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| which is going to sooner or later have some widening and some sidewalks, that word that we don't use much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| So, anyway, I'm excited about this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| We use that word a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| We try not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| So we have a motion and a second to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1762)|

| 0:29:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Thank you both for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1768)|

| 0:32:02| Maybe he's filling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Gary is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Gary is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Gary, just as you're walking up, a quick explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| This is telling us we're self-insured up to, I think it's $2 million, and then we're buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| excess coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Just tell us how this program works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Gary Eastus, the Risk Manager for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Yes, we are self-insured, but we buy what's called excess insurance, which means we set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| a cap beyond which we are insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| And that cap right now is at $2 million per injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| I recall some presentation, maybe it was during the mayor's budget hearings, that we are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| reducing our costs of claims in workers' comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| Could you tell us about that just real briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Our claims have been steadily dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| I've been with the city for a little over 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| And during that period, our claims have dropped dramatically, dropped almost in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| And right now, we're averaging somewhere between $2 to $2.5 million per year in claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| And that's total claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| It is good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| We're continuing to get better and better at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| We just got a newsletter, I guess it was from Public Works, where they're getting their guys to stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| and do warm-ups in the morning so they don't lift something heavy and hurt themselves and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| That is very exciting for me to hear because our number one type of injury is orthopedic-type injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| So that's pretty exciting for me that they're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2018)|

| 0:34:23| to accept the technical assistance to further advance local resilience to climate-related impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2063)|

| 0:34:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Yeah, I don't know if Erin's here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| No, she's not able to be here tonight, but Dr. Lyons may be able to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Yeah, just generally, I read this, but it sounded like a neat thing to apply for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| but it wasn't very clear exactly what you do if you get the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| In other words, what kind of technical assistance or work we would undertake to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| and I wonder if you could elaborate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| It almost seemed like there were two different programs, and one of them is about to end at the end of June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| so I guess it's the first topic one or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Sure, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| There are two sets of programs, and we're under the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| which will be being able to get technical assistance in our energy systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| to make sure that they're not impacted by any kind of potential climate change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| or events that occur based on climate change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| It's really taking advantage of being one of the 16 cities that is climate champions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| being able to take advantage of technical assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| and I think looking at and examining all of our systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| and making sure that getting some ideas so we will be less vulnerable to some climate events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| that could impact them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| and as we might make any adjustments to do so to eliminate use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| and impact on greenhouse gas use in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| I guess it helps that you're close to Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| and have some DOE talent there that can help, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Yes, I think it's bringing in a lot of expertise to look over the conditions we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| and to make any suggestions to make us less vulnerable to climate events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| and I'm sure what the talent at Oak Ridge would be very helpful in getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2175)|

| 0:36:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2179)|

| 0:36:45| relating to buildings and building regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| specifically boarding and securing of unoccupied, open, and accessible buildings which are unfit or dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Yeah, I don't know if David's here or someone that could fill in for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| David's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Okay, Christy's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| We're all concerned about blight and making our city, you know, healthier and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| Could you just tell us why we need this special provision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| Just elaborate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Well, when the ordinance was originally written, it was indicated that this boarding up would be a power within the Better Building Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| and really we do that through the public hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| So it was a technicality that we needed to change that would give the public hearing officer the authority to order boarding up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| Okay, so after a hearing, he gives notice of the landowner, and they can take action rather than waiting for the landowner to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| Yes, we would notify them that they would have 10 days to board up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| We would notify them that they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| It means we don't have to wait for the board to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| How often does the board meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| The Better Building Board, I believe they meet quarterly, and, of course, the public hearing officer, we end up having those more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| So this really gives us a chance to act quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Act much more quickly than waiting on the Better Building Board to be able to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2284)|

| 0:38:09| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Item 12C is an emergency ordinance appropriating the sum of $15,095.29 from the Parks and Recreation Department's Grants and Benevolence Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2290)|
| 0:38:18| and donating same for completed projects to various qualified groups as part of the Challenge Grant Award Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2304)|

| 0:38:28| Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Yeah, so why don't I amend the motion for it to be read on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| It is emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| It is emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| It's presented as an emergency ordinance, so it doesn't need to be read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| But thank you for the thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| I knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| When you looked at me, then I was like, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| It threw me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150623?start=2331)|
