| 2:40:31| The vast majority of projects are started and completed without coming before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9631)|
| 2:40:37| Usually when a development issue comes before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9637)|
| 2:40:42| there is a problem with someone wanting an exception to a rule or wanting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9642)|
| 2:40:47| And so I would definitely look at any development issue that came before this body with a lot of scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9647)|
| 2:40:55| Well, let me hold you right there, because all rezoning issues come before this body if it's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| So it doesn't necessarily have to be a problem issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| Excuse me, maybe I misspoke, but if somebody wants something rezoned, then there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9665)|
| 2:41:11| All rezoning issues would come before here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| I think you might be thinking about the BZA where they need a variance or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9673)|
| 2:41:17| But as far as a rezoning issue, say someone wants to put a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9677)|
| 2:41:23| or a condominium complex and let's say there's some opposition out there possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9683)|
| 2:41:31| the community thinks maybe it should be something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| How would you resolve that type of issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| You would have to look at the impact on the economy, the impact on the county as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| the impact on the alleged burdened neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9704)|
| 2:41:49| and you'd have to look at the impact on the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9709)|
| 2:41:53| As a general rule, with everything else being equal, I think property owner's rights are important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9713)|
| 2:41:59| and you need to honor property owner's rights unless there's some egregious violation to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9719)|
| 2:42:09| Mr. Wallnauer, I'm not trying to get you upset, but it's Tennessee 43, Rutgers 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9729)|
| 2:42:16| With six minutes to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| Chair, entertain a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9739)|
| 2:42:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| Walt, same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9747)|
| 2:42:28| What separates you out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| I mean, I'm looking at the votes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9750)|
| 2:42:31| You've got basically eight percent of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9751)|
| 2:42:34| What maybe did not get out to the people that you wanted to get out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| Tell us what makes you different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| Well, I think that I'm someone who's followed the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| and for those of you who know me, you know I'm someone who's not afraid to speak their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| I don't think that I would be, for the next seven months, a seat warmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| I certainly want to be a caretaker, but we have a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| We have a big budget to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9778)|
| 2:43:00| There's issues in the 4th District that need to be addressed, and I think I could hit the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9780)|
| 2:43:08| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9790)|
| 2:43:11| You answered a little bit on land use, but we didn't get to you specifically on TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| so could we hear your thoughts on that particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| I think that there's two tests that you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9798)|
| 2:43:21| We used to call them pilots until Bill Haslam became mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9801)|
| 2:43:25| They're still called pilots in the city in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| TIFs have to pass two tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| There has to be a cost-benefit ratio that makes sense for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9810)|
| 2:43:34| and you have to pass the but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| This development wouldn't happen but for the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| and I think if those two items are satisfied, then TIFs make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9820)|
| 2:43:46| I think they may be a little overused right now, but I certainly wouldn't rule out future TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9826)|
| 2:43:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| Seeing none, thank you, Mr. Wallenauer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9838)|
| 2:44:03| Now we have, is there anyone that would like to speak on behalf of someone from the 4th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9843)|
| 2:44:12| Or what's on your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| You have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| My name is Steve Drevick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| I reside at 5801 Meadow Glen Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| As a citizen of the 4th District, I'd like to comment in favor of two of the appointees that we've heard from tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9860)|
| 2:44:28| Elaine Davis and Logan Brummett, who I met on the campaign trail while I was campaigning for 4B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9868)|
| 2:44:34| This is not to say anything less about the other candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9874)|
| 2:44:37| I think we have some really great potential appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9877)|
| 2:44:42| but I got to know these people more in the sense of what they would be like as a commissioner than the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9882)|
| 2:44:48| When I first met Elaine, she told me about her story about running in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9888)|
| 2:44:52| and what her issues were at that time in that campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| She mentioned that she pretty much had all the issues pursued, worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| She had gotten them by other means, even though she didn't get elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| So I asked her, well, why do you want to run again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| And she looked me in the eyes and said, there's plenty of things to do that need to get done for the people in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9905)|
| 2:45:10| Who else is going to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9910)|
| 2:45:12| And that really struck me in terms of what was really in her heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9912)|
| 2:45:16| Lately, even during the campaign, we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| she came up and asked me how the Tedford Road dump fire project was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9920)|
| 2:45:25| I didn't have to go and bring up the issue with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| So she's clearly very engaged and cares a lot about every issue that she hears about in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9928)|
| 2:45:33| In the 2006 general election, a lot of people already know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| she captured 45% of the voters in the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| so she clearly has an appeal that crosses party lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| And even in the last election, she ran against a very strong candidate and still did very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9943)|
| 2:45:49| She didn't get shut out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9949)|
| 2:45:50| So I think that would show that a lot of the candidates or a lot of the citizens of the 4th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9950)|
| 2:45:55| would be very happy with her as a caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9955)|
| 2:45:58| As far as Logan goes, Logan and I had many chances to speak, to correspond by e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9958)|
| 2:46:03| and talk about some major issues while we were working on the campaign trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| What impressed me most about Logan is his drive to dig into the details of particular issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9967)|
| 2:46:12| He doesn't take a very superficial approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| He does a lot of research as well as looking at all the issues with an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9975)|
| 2:46:20| As Commissioner Smith has said before, I think twice in shouting from the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| I want people on this commission who can think for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| and I think you would certainly get that with Logan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| During one of the forums at West High School, a question came up with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9991)|
| 2:46:36| and I pulled out my copy of the budget and was looking through the figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| and I noticed out of the corner of my eye, Logan was sitting next to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| and he pulled out his copy, but he had massaged all the data into nice little pie charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10002)|
| 2:46:47| So I guess in one sense I was glad that I don't have to run against Logan in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10007)|
| 2:46:54| So that's really all I have to say about those two candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10014)|
| 2:47:00| Like I said, I just didn't get to know the others very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| but I think you have a good slate of people to choose from in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10031)|
| 2:47:20| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| Ruthie Coleman, 4205 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| As you all know, I'm the candidate for a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| I just want to thank you all, number one, for sitting here and listening to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10049)|
| 2:47:33| and number two to say I feel sorry for you because I think District 4 has some wonderful people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10053)|
| 2:47:40| and you all have a lot of thinking to do, and I am very proud personally as a candidate in District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10060)|
| 2:47:47| I am very proud of the people that have stood up here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| and have offered themselves to you for this appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10071)|
| 2:47:56| and I applaud them, and I don't envy you all at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10076)|
| 2:48:01| but I just wanted them to know, and I want it on record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10081)|
| 2:48:05| that I applaud every one of them for coming forward because they are wonderful people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10085)|
| 2:48:10| and I have worked with all of them during the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10090)|
| 2:48:14| One of them, that funny man, wherever he went, has driven me crazy for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10094)|
| 2:48:20| and everybody else about six months, but it has been wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10100)|
| 2:48:25| They are great people, and I really don't envy you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| but thank you all for what you are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10109)|
| 2:48:35| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| Seeing none, we have a meeting on Wednesday at 530 in the small assembly room, District 6, 8, and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10119)|
| 2:48:48| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=10128)|
