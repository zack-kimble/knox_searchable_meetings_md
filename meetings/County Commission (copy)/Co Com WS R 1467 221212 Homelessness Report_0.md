| 0:01:02| Oh, you know what? It might be unplugged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| We have to do our own A.V. work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| We used to have some high-teen people around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| Is this unplugged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=72)|

| 0:01:44| Does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=105)|

| 0:01:47| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Thank you so much, Madam Chair, for rescheduling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| I'm so sorry that I wasn't able to do this in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| I really appreciate you all being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| I know this is a crazy busy time of year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| and I just appreciate you taking the time to hear more about this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| Last year, Mayor Jacobs asked if my department could develop a report on homelessness in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| and today I just want to provide you all an overview of the information that is going to be in that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| Prior to sending it out to all of you, you should have it first thing tomorrow morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| but we just wanted to give you a brief overview prior to sending that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| So this afternoon, I'm going to touch on a few of the highlights from the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| then leave some time for questions at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| I'll briefly cover what's included in the report, how housing, income, health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| and family status is impacting homelessness here in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| then talk a little bit about the homeless camp growth outside the city, current funding, future initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| And finally, I just want to take a minute to recognize the agencies that assisted us with the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| and data in the report and to recognize the team from Grants and Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| that did all the work to make this report happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| So just a little bit on the report in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| I just want to start by saying that obviously homelessness is a complicated issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| and no single report can cover every aspect of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| What we tried to do with this report is to look at the specific impacts that are happening here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| and see what we can do to have better solutions that will work here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| We started out researching homelessness in general, and you'll see some of that information in the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| but the bulk of our time was spent looking at the situation here at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| The report covers the major causes of homelessness, current policies that impact us here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| lots of data that we tried to make accessible through charts and graphs, funding programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| and what I think may be the most impactful part of this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| interviews with people that are currently living unhoused in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=226)|
| 0:03:55| So I wanted to share this chart early in the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| so you all would have the most up-to-date information available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| This information is provided through Knox HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| HMIS is the Homeless Management Information System that is managed by the University of Tennessee College of Social Work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=246)|
| 0:04:13| and it's utilized to collect all homelessness data here in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| These are the daily averages for the third quarter of 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| and I just wanted to highlight this so you'd have a feel for the scope of the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| as we go through the rest of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| From July through September of this year, we had on average 3,500 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| receiving homelessness services every day here in the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| with 2,359 of those people being literally homeless or, in other words, street homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=277)|
| 0:04:47| So the top causes of homelessness in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| While the cause of homelessness is clearly unique to each individual or family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| a relatively short list of significant contributors, housing, mental health, substance misuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| and the need for additional support networks came up over and over in our general research of the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| And based on the most current HMIS data available here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| our top causes of homelessness line up with those same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| A lack of affordable housing, eviction, job loss and underemployment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| substance misuse, mental health, and domestic violence and family issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| I should also say at this point that the sources of all the information that I'm sharing with you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| and what's in the report, that is all located in the full report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| so you all will be able to check the data, check our research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| and then find more information on anything that you're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| So let's talk a little bit about lack of affordable housing and eviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| When combined, a lack of affordable housing and eviction are by far the greatest cause of homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| cited by unhoused individuals and families living here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| In the first quarter of 2022, home prices increased, as most of you know, by almost 30% in the Knoxville MSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| That increase resulted in a typical home value of around $308,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| which would make it affordable for only about a third of the folks that live here in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| At the same time that we were seeing that change in homeownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| our rent prices increased by 19.27% and demand exceeds supply by about 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=380)|
| 0:06:28| I don't know how many of you all saw the article with all the University of Tennessee students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| sleeping outside trying to get new apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| but that's kind of what it's like for anybody looking for a rental right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| I think those statistics are probably relevant for one of the things that we saw with homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| in the third quarter of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| So there were 750 new households that entered the homeless services system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| and of that 750, 76% of them had previously lived here in the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| I know sometimes there's this idea that homeless folks come from outside of our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| Do I need to be closer? Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| So job loss and underemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| Another frequently cited cause of homelessness we see is job loss and underemployment or low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| Based on ACS data from 2020, the median income in Knox County was $59,250,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| and 42.3% of residents have a household income of less than $49,999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| With local housing costs increasing at record levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| many households are forced to spend a greater percentage of their income on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| Any household that is spending more than 30% of their income on housing is considered housing cost burdened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| While you can see by the chart that this affects households at all income levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| those with the lowest incomes are impacted at a much higher percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| That's 78% and 59% there for our lowest income folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| That's a real problem when you're having to spend 78% of your income just to have a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=480)|
| 0:08:09| So health and family status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| When we look at the data that was reported in HMIS for 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| we see that 24% of people accessing homeless services cited health as their primary cause of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| What that looked like when you broke it down was substance misuse was 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| mental health was 10%, and long-term medical conditions was 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Now, during our interviews with local service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| they told us that the number is actually much higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| And that's why I wanted to share this disability and homelessness chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| If you look at that, we've had over 4,000 of the people that have been served this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| that indicated that they were affected by one of those health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| Many times individuals seeking assistance are concerned that admitting they are struggling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| particularly with substance misuse or mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| they're afraid that that's going to impact their access to services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| so they won't fully disclose their actual cause of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| I also want to mention that while mental and physical health problems are substantial contributors to homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| the reverse is also true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Keeping people stably housed is one of those things that if we can keep someone from becoming homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| it will help us in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| So housing instability and homelessness can actually cause formerly healthy individuals to become ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| Studies have shown that homelessness has a detrimental impact on an unhoused person's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| mental and physical health, and the effects of homelessness can be so destabilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| that an individual or family may struggle for years afterwards to maintain stable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| When we talk about the second chart there, I just wanted to draw some attention to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| is when we talk about homelessness, we often think about just the folks that are downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| However, homelessness has a large impact here in our community on families, youth, and seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| When we talked a little bit before about that mental health and substance misuse number being low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| we see the same thing with the youth number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| One of the agencies that work with homeless youth told us that in addition to the numbers that we actually see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| we probably have about 1,200 more kids living in the city and county right now that are couch surfing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| that a lot of times they're in unsafe homes of people that they don't know very well to keep them off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| They just are not a population that will engage with service providers a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| so that number is much higher than what we actually see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| Then I wanted to talk just a little bit about the camps located outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| Homelessness, as you all know, it's not new to our community, but as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| because I know I've talked to several of you about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| there's been a substantial growth in the number of homeless camps located in the county outside of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| Homeless service providers that we interviewed described just a continual growth in homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| outside the boundaries of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| There are several reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| One that I found really interesting that I did not realize until we did the research for this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| that in 2020, a little more than 620 of the individuals and families that were assisted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| were actually living in the county outside the city prior to becoming homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| So a lot of times people want to stay close to their family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| or they want to stay close to the resources that they're comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Another reason, some folks are just afraid to be close to the city with the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| because there are larger camps, there's sometimes a perception of drug use and victimization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| and folks a lot of times would just prefer to avoid the city camps altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| Historically, camps located in the county have tended to be smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| and they're usually in isolated areas and just weren't very visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| However, with all the development we're seeing in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| and quite frankly the increasing number of unhoused folks, they're really not hidden anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| I know you all are getting more calls, we're getting more calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| it's becoming much more obvious where those camps are out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| The blue dots on the map, those represent camps that are outside the limits of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| Those are general locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| We had one of our service providers that actually does case management out in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| provide this information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| They don't want to provide exact locations just because they work to build relationships with folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| but that is, as you can see, pretty much every district in the county is impacted by this issue now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=768)|
| 0:12:56| Jenny, what constitutes a camp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Really, probably when you're going to see a camp as far as a case manager that would say that's a camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| that it is large enough that they are sending people out to try and connect people to services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| and it's large enough that someone notices that it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| So it's not, you know, just one or two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| It has to be a big enough place that people actually need services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| and that people are aware enough of it that they will send somebody out to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| So this is funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| This is where the county's allocation of funding in response to homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| has increased significantly over the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| In addition to the funding you see there, which is about $2.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| the county also oversees the Treasury's Emergency Rental Assistance Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| and we've provided a little over $54 million in rent and utility payments to landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| and utility agencies since about April of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| That program is actually ending soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| and it's one of the things that we're really concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| how that's going to impact our numbers on homelessness for families coming up in the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=844)|
| 0:14:14| And then future initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| One thing that we know is that we cannot develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| or implement any effective approach to homelessness by ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| We know that partnering with the city, nonprofit agencies, and faith-based organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| is going to be critical for the success of any initiative that we undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| And we're working with all of our partners right now more than we ever have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| The last year we've done a ton of work on building those partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Three of the things that we're really looking at for the coming year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| is developing a policy on homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| We'll be doing that in coordination with other county departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| the Sheriff's Office, the City of Knoxville, and local nonprofit agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| As a matter of fact, two of our biggest partners, the Health Department and Parks and Recreation, are both here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| They've worked with us extensively over the last year as we've kind of tried to wrap our arms around this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| The other thing that we're working on is standing up the Knoxville-Knox County Office of Housing Stability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| which we are hoping to do through a partnership with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| What we are looking to do is have a single office take the lead on issues of housing instability and homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| with an initial goal of evaluating where we are on current funding and programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| and identifying gaps and future needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| What we really want to make sure is that all of our efforts are coordinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| and that we're not duplicating services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| What we don't want to do is be the county paying for their program, the city's paying for the same program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| and what we might need to do is pay for one program and then pay for another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| We're hoping that if we can do this coordinated effort, that that will really take us to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| Finally, one of the things that we've been working on is working with local faith-based organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=954)|
| 0:16:03| to expand the number of homeless day centers in strategic areas around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| I know a couple of you have been out to Fig Tree, which is Koxbury United Methodist Church's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| It's a wonderful program where they provide meals, they have showers, laundry facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| computer labs for folks that are living without a house right now so that they can access what they need to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=981)|
| 0:16:32| One of the things that surprises people a lot of times when we talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| is the number of folks that are going to work every day and living in their car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| and dropping their kids off to school and then living in their car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| and lots of those folks are accessing services there at Fig Tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| They make sure people can get a shower and do their laundry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| and what we're hoping to do is to have a couple other churches around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| that can provide those same kind of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| And then finally, I just wanted to publicly thank all the agencies that are listed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1019)|
| 0:17:07| for the time and effort they provided to us while we were working on this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| We absolutely could not have done it without their assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| You'll see when I send the report to you tomorrow, there's just a ton of data and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| It's about 22 pages, and without these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| we would not have been able to provide you all the information at the level that we have been able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| I also want to thank the team in my department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| I won't try and guess the number of hours that went into getting this done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| but I can say for sure that it was in the hundreds, if not thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| It was definitely a group effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| Y'all stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| It was definitely a group effort, but I do want to mention one person specifically, Zach Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| Wave, Zach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| He took the lead on this project, and he spent many, many days interviewing subject matter experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| and unhoused individuals and families living in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| and this report would not have happened without all of his efforts and leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| I'll close by just saying that most likely, despite our very best efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| we are not going to end homelessness in Knox County any time in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| There are no quick solutions or easy answers for a problem as complicated as homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| but I do believe that the work that we're doing right now to develop a plan and partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| that address the specific needs and resources that we have here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| it's going to provide long-term benefits for the folks that are living here right now unhoused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| and, I think, even more for our community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| And I am happy to take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| Director Book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| I saw on one of your early slides one that just really shocked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| and that was a 19.27% increase in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| What's that over what period of time is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| So that is from the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| My gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| And honestly, I think it's probably maybe even a little higher at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| That was based on data from earlier this year, so I would not be surprised if it's not gone a little higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| Now, I think we will see that come back the other way maybe in about six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| because rents really have gotten just completely unaffordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| It's one of the things that we've been able to see from the backside of the Emergency Rental Assistance Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| When you see apartments that have gone from $750 a month to $1,300 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| people are just not going to be able to sustain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| So I do think we're going to have to see a swing back the other way at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| but I think it's going to take a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Well, it was very, very shocking, but I guess that's the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| I'm very excited to see the report and see the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| I'm sure that there's a much more comprehensive set of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| The first is in your findings and with all the resources, both city and county, state, federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1210)|
| 0:20:19| everything from the local level to the top of the food chain, is any of it getting better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| I mean, are we improving in any category, or does the data show that the problem is getting worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| no matter how many resources we throw against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| I do think that there are areas where we're seeing good movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| I think there are parts of the country, this coordinated effort, really there's some real movement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1240)|
| 0:20:49| You can kind of get everybody working towards the same goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| You see a pretty positive impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Here I think we've done a pretty phenomenal job on permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| and there are some real positive impacts for folks once they get into permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| One of the issues that we're seeing maybe particularly on the county side, but I can't say that for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| is that a lot of the folks that we are, like the car homeless people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| it's not that they need permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| They don't need those wraparound services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| They just need affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| They just need a place to live that they can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| So it is, I think we are making good progress on folks that maybe need more of that long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| and those wraparound services, but we've got to start tackling that affordable housing side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| that it's really not so much that you need services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| You just need a place you can afford to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| And then secondarily, does your report look at best practices in other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| and offer points of interest to look for as a legislative side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| recommendations or best practices or here's who's doing it right or making significant strides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| No, but that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| Maybe that will be report 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| We do have recommendations in the report, but we do not yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| we don't have best practices from other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Now we've got some general research from, you know, what works in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| but not anything specifically about other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Okay, here's my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| How does this report turn into action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| Because this county, along with every other county in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| loves to research stuff and write reports and then put them on shelves and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| it wasn't that nice, didn't we do a great job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| And we had a concentrated, all hands on deck, city, county, community effort decades ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| with a 10-year plan to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| And the minute it went into effect, everybody scattered and it died on the vine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| How do you turn this into action and stick with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| I think that joint initiative that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| there's a ton of work that has been going into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| I think that is because I completely understand what you're saying about the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| We've actually looked at all of that just in hopes of avoiding that same kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| because doing a plan and having nothing to back it up is useless to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| It falls under our department and we are dedicated to trying to find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| not to solve it because we're not going to solve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| but to have a positive impact and make sure that the funds that we have available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| are going to actual initiatives that are evidence-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| and that will make an impact long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| I have several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| First of all, did you identify how many children are homeless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| We have youth identified, so 18 and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| You will see in the report they're listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| but specifically we don't have anything that breaks it down by children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| It's just 18 and under, 18 to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| Are these children that are homeless, are they attending school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| How are you addressing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| I know that some of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Only Knox County Schools, they actually have an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| a homelessness office for children that are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| We have not worked with them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| We plan to, but I know that there is a significant number of them that are in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| And my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| I'm in the court system every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| How would you suggest that when people tell me they're homeless, who do they call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Because there seems to be so many people they call and they can't get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| Who would you say, call this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| I think it would be determined probably on where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| I mean, we've got multiple service providers that can assist them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Anyone that can help someone get an HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| So you've got CAC, VMC, Fig Tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| We've got multiple agencies that can help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Honestly, it might be easier just to point them in the direction of our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| and then we can point them in the direction of the agencies that might be most suited to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| Or 2-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Or 2-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| 2-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Always 2-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Everyone tells me that when they call, they're just a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| And that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| The number, like as far as now, emergency shelter beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| people can most of the time access those emergency shelter beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| but that is not, you know, we don't have shelter space for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| That is a difficult problem right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1552)|

| 0:26:10| actually talking with each one of them and what they do on a day-to-day basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1570)|

| 0:26:16| and, you know, to kind of speak to what Commissioner Jay said about what are we doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| And there is action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1581)|

| 0:26:29| They are working so very hard to coordinate the dozens and dozens of agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| and organizations that address homelessness in both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| And, you know, they speak to that there are dozens of moving parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| and no solution and very little resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| So I applaud you all for what you are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| You know, this started back when Mr. VandeVate was in community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| and I am so incredibly proud of what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| I mean, their staff has increased by how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| We were at four, and we're now at 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Yes, 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| And even when I met with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| they couldn't even really tell me the number of agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| and organizations that they work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| But they're just a tremendous resource to our county and to our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| and I truly cannot thank you enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1646)|

| 0:27:37| and it's something that a lot of people don't like to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| And I'm so very glad that we are talking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| and that we're doing something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1666)|

| 0:27:54| When the fig tree moved out to West Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| you know, they did a great job of providing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| to a certain percentage of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| It also brought some unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| There was an element that now came out to West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| that wasn't there before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| and they've had a dramatic impact on the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| just down the street from Cokesbury Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| In fact, one of the businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| they have an outdoor employee lunch table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| that now when they come to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| needles, human feces on the picnic table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| Some of the female employees are not anxious now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| to be employed at that location anymore because of what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| Sheriff's Department's been notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| They've had video surveillance of what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| the people shooting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| It's a private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| The homeless have now come in the front door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| and walked into the restroom and used the restrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| and then proceeded to use drugs in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| One of the fast food restaurants next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| has had the folks standing in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| as the people come through the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| So now their customers want to go to a different restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| to have lunch because they don't want to be harassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| by this small element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| The other day, some of the homeless actually got on the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| of this fast food restaurant during the middle of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| So there's some unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| when you move the support structure from the downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| out to the different areas of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| Plus, the business community was not aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| of what Cokesbury was doing in advance, to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| All of a sudden, boom, it was open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| and they were off to the races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| So it's just something that you guys need to be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| that it's not going over well with the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| because now they're having to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Well, the one thing that I would say in response to that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| I don't know that Fig Tree opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| brought homeless people to West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| I think Fig Tree's actually been there longer than people are aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| but with the increase in homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| you are seeing it more in all parts of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| including West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| I mean, Cedar Bluff, we've got some areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| that are not close to Fig Tree, not in walking distance to Fig Tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| where you are seeing a serious increase in homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Callahan Road, some of those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| So I don't know that Fig Tree brought the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| I think Fig Tree is trying to address the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| It is actually something that when we are out having conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| with some of these faith-based organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| some of the other churches in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| we want to make it really clear to them what this kind of work looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| because it's not pretty, and you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| I mean, there have been some tough things that have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| that they have dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| and we want to make sure that any of the churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| that are interested in getting involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| understand what that's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| But I'm not sure that while, yes, it is difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| that some of the areas of the county are seeing some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| that they haven't before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| I don't know that not providing services there is the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| because even prior to Fig Tree opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| we had people that they're just not going to come into the city for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| And as this problem gets bigger, and it is not just here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| obviously it's a major issue across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| we've got to find a way to address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| because those communities that don't have these services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| are being equally impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| If you go out to Callahan Road and talk to some of those businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| places around merchants, like they're seeing that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| So, like I said, there's no easy answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| but I'm not sure that Fig Tree opening brought anybody there specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| Well, the homeless camp that was just down the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| that the city of Knoxville came in and closed down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1938)|

| 0:32:28| And the one, also the other homeless camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| off in the Turkey Creek development, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| that the city and the county cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| I can't specifically speak to that, Commissioner, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| I don't know the dates on those, but I'll be happy to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1963)|
| 0:32:52| Thank you. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Commissioner Lee, just for a point of reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| when you were asking about our homeless students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| I can speak a little bit to that, and if you did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| I would encourage you to contact the homeless coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| This person, and actually I think there's two people now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| they're funded through the McKinney Veto Homeless Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| it's federal money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| and this homeless coordinator within the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| is the first point of contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| whenever a child or children present themselves at a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| without a permanent address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| The schools go so far as if it's a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| that was a Knox County School student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| that has to move from south to north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| because they're couch kids now or couch families now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| just having to crash with whoever will give them a warm space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| then the schools will provide transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| they'll actually pick the kids up and take them to their home school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| so that they can have as little disruption as possible for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| and they're very resourceful in hooking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| I mean the target is the children, but it helps the whole family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| making sure that they are keeping up with books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| and basic hygiene and this type of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| to try to minimize the impact that homelessness has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| on the children, on the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| How many homeless did you say we have currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| So when you look at the daily average for the last quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| it was 3,500 per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| 3,500 people per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| So is that what you think the total population is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| or do we think it's more like they come in every two or three days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| I think when you look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| so like I said about the youth population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| that doesn't include the youth population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| The number is definitely higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| Folks that are out in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| so those are the people that have actually gone through the HMIS process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| So that means they have been in contact with a case manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| their information has been entered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| We definitely have a larger number than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| Estimating what that looks like is hard, but it's bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| Do you have a guesstimate at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Like are we talking about it's double that or triple that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Just so we can kind of have an idea of what kind of issue we're dealing with here on a countywide level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| I would absolutely hate to throw out any number because I will be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| But I think if you look at those, even just those youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| if you count that extra 1,200 kids that are couch homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| which I think even that number is probably low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| Yes, I would think that it is at least maybe 2,000 more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| but that is literally just off the top of Jenny's head, which may mean nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| So we're talking around 6,000 people in total, give or take, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| Roughly, maybe 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| 5,000, five or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Yes, five or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Then how much are we spending collectively with all the organizations on trying to help these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| I cannot tell you what those individual organizations are spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| I can tell you that what we are spending right now this fiscal year is about $2.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| The city is spending that same, somewhere in that same neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| We also have some additional COC funds that go directly to these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| But I could not tell you what the budget is for all of these nonprofit agencies or even the churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2197)|
| 0:36:45| I can't tell you what that number looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| We're at a minimum of $6 million then if you're spending $2.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| the city is spending $2.8 million, and then add some books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Yes, I would say that is a good minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Minimum of $6 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| When you all went through, again, I haven't seen the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| I may be asking something that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Did you look at the annual state of housing report that we get every year or the housing market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| I mean, there's a direct correlation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| We've been told by the real estate professionals that come to us every March, April with an annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| We're always 15,000, 18,000 units behind and some years getting worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| Obviously, from a pure economic standpoint, the more inventory you have, the more types of housing you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| the more affordability factors and price factors change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| If you have limited supply, the prices go up, and if you have more supply, the prices go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| If you look at that and how it factors into, again, we're trying to get to legislative decisions about how we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| determine land use or policies as it relates to building or development or housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| and is that a factor that you can sort of directly correlate to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Hanson's report is definitely quoted in our report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| One of the numbers that I found fascinating is that the Knoxville-Knox planning estimated about 50,000 units is what we will need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2290)|
| 0:38:20| or 40,000 units is what we will need by 2050 to meet the demand of everybody coming in to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| And, you know, we are well behind on building as much as we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| but even when we look at that $308,000 mark that we are right now at sort of that median home price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| that's still so unaffordable for low-income folks that are the ones that end up that we see homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2320)|
| 0:38:47| It is absolutely something that we talk about in many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| The homelessness crisis that we are seeing right now is really more, it's an affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| Like, the homeless will always be with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| but what we are seeing right now is in large part an affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| And within that same vein, did you all look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| affordable housing has become this big blanket term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| and I look at it as government subsidized housing versus workforce unit also may be subsidized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| or is it affordable as it comes to marketplace, and there's probably five or six definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| Did you look at which of those areas are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| We are just looking at the cost of housing, not subsidized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| We are just looking at is this housing affordable for this group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| and that, like you said, comes in all different shapes and forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| You know, subsidized housing, workforce housing, we have a huge lack of workforce housing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| When you're looking at, you know, families making $75,000 a year with two working parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| they can't afford a house right now either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| So absolutely, subsidized housing is a wonderful thing for folks at the very bottom that need that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2397)|

| 0:40:15| I know that we have been using some of the hotels to assist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| and one thing that was reported at one of the last CAC meetings is that some of those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| and families have been displaced because of the lack of housing for the University of Tennessee students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2425)|

| 0:40:49| the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, the funding that we have been using to provide those hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| for those families, that money does run out at the end of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| However, the city of Knoxville had an extra $400,000 in some of their federal funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| and they've been able to transition that money into the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| You know, we started with their funding with hotels, and then their funding ran out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2469)|

| 0:41:23| What we didn't want to do was to put, and these people that are housed in hotels right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| that's our vulnerable population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2488)|

| 0:41:34| And what we didn't want to do was see that funding end in the coldest month of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221212-homelessness-report?start=2494)|
