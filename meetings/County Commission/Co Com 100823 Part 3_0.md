| 0:00:00| and the things necessary with the-and I know it's just a concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| but you don't have that even remotely in your drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6)|
| 0:00:11| You know, you've got on the neighborhood commercial, you've got 25-correct me if I'm wrong, Buzz-25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=11)|
| 0:00:15| building set back off the property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=15)|
| 0:00:18| Is that what neighborhood commercial is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=18)|
| 0:00:22| I'm sorry to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=22)|
| 0:00:24| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=24)|
| 0:00:25| As long as I can get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=25)|
| 0:00:38| The side yard setback where if it's a side yard and it abuts a residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| that building setback has to be not less than 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| And then it goes on to give some landscaping requirements for that setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=47)|
| 0:00:51| Is that a building setback or an asphalt setback for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| I believe it's a building setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| Now, if it's a rear yard, the rear yard adjacent to a residential agriculture district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| the building setback should not be less than 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=62)|
| 0:01:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| And I measured just on KGIS, I measured real quick the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| The intersection from Buffett-is it Buffett Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| Yes, the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| It's called Buffett Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| North Shore to Buffett Mill, the intersection is only 366 feet from Choteau Mill Lane to North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=80)|
| 0:01:30| And if you add another driveway in that 300 and we haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| I don't know what the site plan is for the Huber property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| We potentially have four driveway or three driveways in 300 feet offsets, all of them offsets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=98)|
| 0:01:47| And I think that creates a, although I think in my district there's another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| I looked it up on another thing on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| On a one acre lot, there's a beautiful autumn care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| senior living has built a beautiful place on a 1.1 acre and it's sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| And so, but they don't have the shrubbery and the things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| They didn't have to build that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| So, I mean, it's possible, but I'm concerned about the traffic as far as site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| and three driveways within 300 feet of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| You're going to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| If you submit the architectural plan to the MPC for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| then you don't have to worry about that building anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| It either gets reduced in size or moved and that's just a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| We're not here on a use and review today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| And the traffic, the traffic would only create two driveways on that side of the road, not three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| Well, I'm talking about Choteau Mills is an entry exit off Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| It's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| And then you're going to have yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| And then there will be another one between it and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| And then you're going to have one on the Huber side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| Well, their intention is to access from North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| That's why they're going to lower that hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| North Shore only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Do they have North Shore only access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| No, no, they said two accesses, two accesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| And I think they have 15 acres so they can go down and access beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Those are my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| You know, this one's a difficult one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| My treasurer actually lives on Choteau Road and one of my best friends, and she's actually against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=200)|
| 0:03:28| My question is what is going to happen with this lot if you don't get this approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| What could you put there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Because I drive by this lot all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| And when I see it, it doesn't look like a lot that you could put the level of housing that you see in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=219)|
| 0:03:48| I don't see another half million or million dollar home sitting on this lot because it's so close to North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| What will you do with this property if you don't get this zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| It was carved out specifically from the Buffett Mill group of residences because you can't put a house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| It's at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Once you develop the Huber property on the other side of Choteau Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| there's less likely a residential use for this property, so you can't use it for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| I mean, I hear what my colleagues are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| and I question whether there's enough room for a convenience store here and still putting the shrubbery in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=261)|
| 0:04:29| And I guess if it were my property, I would probably put a car wash in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| You've got a lot of subdivisions in the area with neighborhood restrictions where folks can't wash their car at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| But, you know, it's not my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| It's not for me to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| You could do a car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| You could do a barber shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| You could do a small daycare center, but it would have to be limited in the number of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| On that size lot, it would be pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| I mean, I see the concerns of the folks who are against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| And it's, you know, I mean, for somebody like me who is so strongly pro-property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| for me to really see why the other side is against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| and seeing that they have a valid and legitimate argument is pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| But on the other hand, I also see that I don't see much use for this property if you don't get this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| I mean, yeah, you could sell it under market and put a smaller, cheaper house there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=319)|
| 0:05:28| but I don't, that's, you probably have so much in this lot you couldn't afford to sell it cheaper like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| So I, you know, I'm not sure what to, how to vote on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| And this is very, very rare for me on a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| Usually it's pretty cut and dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| But you're saying that if you don't get this zoning that you're essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| your client is going to be forced to pay taxes on a piece of property that he has utterly no use of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| In essence, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| And what else could you do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| And that's why I think a CN zone is appropriate for a lot like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| That's why I'm arguing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| I think that's why they hired me to come argue here is because what else are you going to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| And not only that, if you put the conditions on it that require it to be compatible with the aesthetics of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| and the NC zone, you can get what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| You just can't do it willy-nilly without conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| And that's what I talked with the client about and they agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| Well, I mean, the other project across the road that I supported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| and I feel like I probably should support your project since I supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| What's good for the goose is good for the gander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| But the thing that made me more comfortable with that was this was a large piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| They had room to do the greenery and the little white picket fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| And they just had the space to make something that you're almost not going to notice as you drive by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=409)|
| 0:06:57| But if you live in those neighborhoods and you know that's where the Weigel store is at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| or you know that's where the hairdresser is at, then you're going to find those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| And that's what I'm struggling with is, you know, if you said you wanted to build a car wash, I can visualize a car wash there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| I can visualize it surrounded by trees there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| If you said you were going to put a pilot there, I just cannot visualize a pilot store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| And I like pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| I shop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| But I just can't visualize one on a lot that small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| And do you have a specific tenant in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| or were you going to get the rezoning and start shopping for a tenant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| The zoning kind of pretermits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| And what we're looking at is looking at the Huber property to see what's going there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| and to put something that's not repetitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| And there's only one commercial establishment that's going to go on the Huber property so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| So it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| And we're not here to talk about that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| And yet you can almost not talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| But we're here to talk about the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| If we can get the zone, we can find something that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| and make it compatible through the conditions and through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| And not a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| I mean, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Because what I don't want to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| and what I don't think anybody here wants to happen is in this very nice neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| to cover this whole lot with asphalt and have a convenience store sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| And is there any way that we could do this where we're not saying no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| and I'm asking the law director and the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Is there any way that we can do this without saying no, but where we say we want you to bring it back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| when you have a specific tenant and a specific plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Is there a motion that I can make that would do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| Because I am willing to make a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| but not a Katie, borrow the board, do whatever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| Is there a motion I could make that would require this to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| Do you want Jens one of them to handle that or do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| I'm ambivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Denying the zoning request would make them come back at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| Yeah, but it would be a year before they could come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| It will be well more than a year by the time the adjacent development gets underway, let alone built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=564)|
| 0:09:35| Can I make the motion to withdraw it so that he can bring it back in a month or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| or can only the client make the motion to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| No, he would have to withdraw his petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| He would have to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Sir, now take it for what it's worth because I have no legal degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| but if I were in your shoes based on my feel of this commission right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| because if I'm struggling with it, I know there's a lot of folks that are clearly on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| If I were your attorney, I would advise you to withdraw this right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| because then you have the option to bring it back at your leisure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| I am the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| I'm just saying I'm not an attorney and I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn select, but I can count to ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=618)|
| 0:10:27| Commissioner, he can withdraw the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| However, the one-year time, the one-year clock starts because MPC denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| He would still be subject to the one-year rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Well, it doesn't do any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| I appreciate your offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| I just, you know, want to make a statement on this, and I'm a lot like Commissioner Lambert is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| is that if it's a good place for development, I like to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| The thing that's unique about this piece of property, and particularly in relationship to the Huber property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| which we approved, is this is in a very upscale neighborhood of homes that are $500,000 to $800,000 and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=663)|
| 0:11:11| I supported, against a lot of opposition from my constituents, the Huber property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| But I did that because they did have enough land where they could put these businesses in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| They could put trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| They could put shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| They could use shared parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| And I still believe that when that project is finished, it will be something that will fit into the neighborhood very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| and actually add value to the homeowner's property because of some of the convenience for shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| I have to say I do have a lot of concerns about this particular piece of property fitting in with that type of neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=699)|
| 0:11:48| because you just don't have the same room and the same options that the Huber property did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| There's still a lot of uncertainty about what could even be put there and what it would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| And for that reason, at least on my part, and I'm speaking only for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| is that I'm going to vote to uphold the MPC's recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Buzz, I think you were trying to tell us something at the very beginning of what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| And I think what I heard you say is that we really can't do this because there's, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=741)|
| 0:12:31| because it's a sector plan issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Am I correct in what you were trying to tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| The option that you have to deal only with the rezoning is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| That's our option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| If you're only dealing with rezoning, but in this case you have a sector plan amendment that has to be dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| then that was denied at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| So that kicks into your second option of what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| That was my only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| I'm going to light some if we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| Motion on the floor is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| Deny the appeal, you must vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=791)|

| 0:16:27| So if there's, if there's no clear majority, then we revert back to discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=987)|

| 0:17:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Commissioner Markharmon votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Commissioner Strickland votes, I'm sorry, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Strickland passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Commissioner McKenzie passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| Pinbar, we sure got a lot of echoes in here on there, my eyes, to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1035)|
| 0:17:24| Now, Mr. Law Director, if I understand parliamentary procedure correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| and I probably watch C-SPAN a wee bit more than most folks, if these passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1048)|
| 0:17:37| don't vote, then this motion, you know, when you say, do the passes wish to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1057)|
| 0:17:44| they can make a stand one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| But if the passes don't choose to vote, then this thing dies for a lack of ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| positive votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Now, that's my understanding of Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| And then if someone wanted to discuss it, someone on the prevailing side, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1076)|
| 0:18:05| the way I count the votes now, the prevailing side would be those of us who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| against this, unless one of us wanted to bring the motion to reconsider, then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| dies for lack of a positive vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| Am I reading those correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| Unless Commissioner Finbar wants to take back his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| If I'm not mistaken, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| He's not announced his vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Can the maker of the motion withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| At this point, he can withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| I think the problem was, I don't know if the commission was aware that they're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| voting definitively on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| I'm just making that assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| So the maker of the motion could withdraw before the announcement of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Once you start, once you announce it, then your passes don't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| Well, then in the interest of making sure we discuss it, I'll withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| I thought surely everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Did the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Second will agree to the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Let's have debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| Now we are back on the regular floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| So now we need a motion to pass it so we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| We need a motion of one kind or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| I need a motion to approve, assuming we would have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| We have a motion and a second to approve discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| You're first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Somebody get a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| I got one on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| I was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| This is a difficult matter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| I see all the community support, but I also know that we are under a court order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| We can give the school board a set amount of money, but we can't tell them how to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| And, in fact, this is saying let's throw a fit and hold back some money to show our displeasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| I'm not sure that's in the spirit of good cooperation with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| I believe that we should have a new school, several new schools and a whole bunch of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| I've been fighting for schools the four years I've been on here, but it's such a frustrating experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| I said take the development corporation and the chamber of commerce off the public dole and put those millions to use for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1225)|
| 0:20:35| I lost that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| I said freeze the sheriff's department and start losing folks by attrition because we're over the deputies per thousand of many other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1237)|
| 0:20:45| communities, and I lost that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I said maybe we can make some cuts in vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| I partially won that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| We didn't save as much as I'd hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| I've been trying to save money and give it to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| It's been a four-year crusade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| But now we get to the point where my colleagues haven't agreed with me on how to save that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| and we've got a whole bunch of money going into a pension plan, and only Commissioner Luthold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| and I said that the voters voted for an eight-cent increase and we should pay it up front rather than borrow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| That's another big drag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| I wish that money were out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| I wish we weren't under court order so maybe we could sit down with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| But the schools have done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| I think your beef is with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| And so, therefore, I don't see how we can do anything other than give them the capital budget they have asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| and pray that improvements will be sufficient, even though I know we probably could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| and should do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1302)|
| 0:21:51| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| And, you know, I want to thank everyone from the Carter community that came out here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| This is what community involvement is supposed to be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| And I think that all of us have heard the message about the community wants a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| And I'm going to add some to what Commissioner Harmon said, and I'm talking about me personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| and I think about many people on this commission is that I really don't think there's one person on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| that does not want Carter to have a new school if the school board says that that's the way we should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| And if the school board sent us a request, this is not about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| This is not about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| If the children need a new school and the school board looks at that and they say they need a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| I'll be the first to stand up and vote for it and I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| The discussion tonight doesn't need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| and should not be whether we need a new school or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| It's are we doing it according to the county charter and according to the court law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| the court-ordered interpretation of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| And I'm going to read to you from the county charter, and this is Section 6.01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| and it says the Knox County Board of Education has exclusive management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| and control of the school system, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| There was a lawsuit in April of 2003, and I have it right here for anyone that wants to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| And this was an order of compromise from the Chancellery Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| and it was signed on April 21, 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| and under the agreement, and I'll read this to you again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| it says the Knox County Commission will not exercise oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| in regard to the expenditure of any funds previously appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| And I think that's really what this discussion tonight really should be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| It's not about whether the commission wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| or doesn't want Carter to have a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| It's not about whether we can afford it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| because if it's dealing with the children and their education, I think we'll approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| I think it would be close to being approved unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| I mean, this is the primary purpose of this Knox County government is the education of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1455)|
| 0:24:23| About two-thirds of our budget goes to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| and we could find money for something that the school board says needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| But the school board has looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| and the message that they're coming to us with is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| considering the whole school system, is that they're recommending the repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| rather than the placement of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| And I think that where this argument needs to be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| and where the decision and the discussion needs to take place is with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| And I don't want anyone out there to misinterpret why some of us are voting for or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| It's not against the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| It's the process, it's the law, and it's the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| And I hope that you'll understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| Because we do not have, it's very clear in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| and it's very clear from this order of compromise from Chancery Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| that we, and I'll repeat it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| will not exercise oversight in regard to the expenditure of any funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1515)|
| 0:25:25| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| I defer to Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| I agree 100% with what Dr. Briggs just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| And the operative word is previously appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| And what's before this body tonight is what are we going to appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| Nothing more, nothing less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| I'm not here to tell Dr. McIntyre what he's supposed to do or what he's not supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| But the real question is as I represent the people of the 8th District who have come to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| and said that they would like a chance to talk to this new school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| and there was four people on the new school board running under the auspices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| that they were in support of a new Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| This body at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1573)|
| 0:26:22| this body at least Commissioner Briggs has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| and I think that they would step up to the plate if the school board were to ever ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| and that's all we ask to build a new Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| and give this commission an opportunity to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| So we're not in violation of any agreed order from any court by voting this up or voting this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1601)|
| 0:26:51| The real risk of voting it up is that Carter community will no longer be able to have a dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| with the school board because it would be moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| I've been asked by some of the new school board people, not just one but more than one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| that this be deferred and let them deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1628)|
| 0:27:18| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| I would really like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| You just did and it's properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1644)|
| 0:27:37| Commissioner Armstrong, did you make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Yes, I did, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Not a motion, a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| And I would like to give the community and the new school board an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1664)|
| 0:27:53| and one of the other reasons I'm doing this is because I would like to give the school board an opportunity to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| to us with a quality recommendation without the bias toward me as a county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| and because of maybe getting in people's faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| There's been a request for a risk assessment that will help us do a better job in determining what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| and what we can't do with this particular facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| There's just a lot of unanswered questions that if I were going to be on county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| in another 30 days I would be more than willing to ask because this is the taxpayer's dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| It is my kids in the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| and I take those people in the 8th District very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| and Dr. McIntyre understands probably better than anybody in this room how seriously I do take these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| We've had a discussion over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| So it's not about me and Dr. McIntyre and it's not about me and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| It's about giving my community an opportunity to have dialogue with their new school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| They believe they have the votes to get a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| I don't know whether they do or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| It just takes five and I know that out of the five that just ran, four ran with that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| The fifth one got defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1750)|
| 0:29:19| So instead of voting on an up or down tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| I would request from my colleagues here to send this back to the new school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| as we have done many things that would impact the future of Knox County at this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| We have deferred many things to September the 1st County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| because we didn't think it was the right thing to do for this body including me to vote on your future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| and I would like for this body to give the new school board their request to deal with the Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| and let them vote on how they want to deal with their future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| and the future of my community and the Carter community here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| and I request that you would support my substitute motion at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1802)|
| 0:30:17| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| Miss Kincaid, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| I saw you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Can you come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| I just need to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1824)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| You know, I'm kind of, I want Carter to have a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| but I think commission is very close to overstepping their bounds with the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1844)|
| 0:30:51| With that being said, my question, and I've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| and I apologize for not calling you previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| but I just got back into town last night from a nine-day trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| My question to you is, if it's deferred, would you ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| and this is just an off-the-wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| this probably makes too much sense for government idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| would you ask the school board as their chairman to consider, chairperson, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| and I talked to Dr. McIntyre earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| We had a great discussion, but, and I know he's acting as an agent of the board because you are his boss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| in essence, and so would you ask the school board to consider when you bid out the Southwest School to include four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1893)|
| 0:31:46| we've got, I think, roughly $17 million for the Southwest School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| anywhere between $5 and $6 million for the Carter renovation project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| Would you ask them to send out a request for proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| a two-school package that a developer could put together and see if we can get those two schools built for the $22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1922)|
| 0:32:12| or $23 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1932)|
| 0:32:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Thanks, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| I think what the board, the sitting board, and what I expect the new board members will want to do is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1953)|
| 0:32:41| we've studied these issues and we always try to do the fiscally responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| and educationally sound thing to do, and what the evidence, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| and scrutiny and analysis has shown the board and Dr. McIntyre's additional scrutiny based on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| some of the questions raised in this room a month or two ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| showed that renovation was going to be, was going to solve the problems at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| and give them a high-quality facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Because like many of you have said, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| I think there's consensus that the current facility is not adequate and that we want to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| And the board has wanted to move forward with this since March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| You know, I think that we can ask the board and we can ask Dr. McIntyre to bid out any new projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| with those same parameters in mind, you know, fiscally responsible, prudent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| within our budget and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| I don't think at this point in time that if we think a $3 million renovation is going to get the job done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2023)|
| 0:33:53| in a high-quality way, then I don't know why we would take the path that you suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| Well, my concern is, and I've looked at the discussions we had last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| and we're not bringing the problem that, you know, Powell Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| me and Dr. McIntyre talked about, Powell Middle School, we virtually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| we renovated Powell Middle School, but we doubled it in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| And there's no, Powell Middle School was not old enough to have the problems that Carter Elementary has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| When I say that, I mean there was no, these classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| the classrooms are still not going to be up to standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| It's not, please, please, please, please, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| We can draw this out a long time with applause, and I don't think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| What I'm concerned about is we're going to do enough renovation to bring it up to minimal standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2076)|
| 0:34:44| when it's not, some of the classrooms are not going to be close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| They're not going to be size-wise, for teacher-wise, storage-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| We're not looking, you know, Knox County is known for not being 10-year focused, 20-year focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| We're not, the Carter Elementary School at a $3 million or $4 million renovation is not going to be sufficient in 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| And I just, I don't want to tell the school board what to do, but I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| And you all, I mean, you all know education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I don't know education as well as I wish I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| But we're not bringing the school up to the standard that we might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| In this economic time of building, I mean, builders are building for at cost or below because they want to keep their people employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| And now is the time to see if we can take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| You know, we've got 26 acres up there, and then we have an empty building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| I just, I would like to look at it before we make a final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Just, that's my only, I mean, if it bounces back to us next month with the same recommendation that you all have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| I'm voting to renovate Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| But I would like for us to look at the potential of building both for the, putting all the money in the pot and building them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2157)|
| 0:36:05| That's my only request of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| Next month, I think it's, I mean, I'm uneasy about bouncing it back and forth because we're not doing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2169)|
| 0:36:19| bouncing it back and forth is just a power play, and we need to have a better relationship than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| But I'd like for us to look for that out-of-the-box thought of maybe putting the money together and building two schools for that pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2184)|
| 0:36:33| Commissioner Andrews, I will certainly, and maybe Dr. McIntyre can address that particular question right now better than I am equipped to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2193)|
| 0:36:42| But I did want to just bring to your attention that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| you sort of implied that the renovation was going to be sort of a penny-wise, pound-foolish type of thing, a Band-Aid or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| But I think actually the renovation to preserve, you know, be good stewards of our existing facilities is the fiscally prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2213)|
| 0:37:02| And over a fifth of our buildings are as old or older than Carter Elementary School, including the one my own children attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2222)|
| 0:37:13| And we renovate, and we take care of them, and we make sure they're modern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| And, you know, we deal with any issues that older buildings have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| And we want to do the same thing at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| So I just, we want to preserve as much money as we can because we know we don't, you know, our resources are scarce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| Our top priority is educating our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| So we don't, we try to do our best to be fiscally prudent in everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| We don't have any option other than to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| But if you want Dr. McIntyre to try to address that question about the two, you know, what you said, I'd be happy to defer to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2260)|
| 0:37:49| Well, I mean, being that he had that, I mean, I know his feeling on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| And I'm asking you as the chairperson of the school board to, you know, it's not his, you all tell him what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| And so I'm, I can't ask him what to do nor ask you what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| But I'm asking you to put it before your board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I know his answer already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| And I would have asked you if I hadn't had time earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| But, you know, he's going to say what you all want him to say because he has to say that because you are his boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2290)|
| 0:38:18| What we ask the superintendent to do is not just be a yes man, but to do the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| He works for you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| I mean, he's going to do what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| And you all are going to, I mean, you all work as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| I'm just, and I didn't say that it wouldn't, you know, whoever the architect is, if there is a renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| whoever the architect is, is going to do a fabulous job or we won't accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| I'm not saying it's not going to be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| What I'm saying is in 10 years, I don't think it's going to be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| And I just am concerned that this is the market to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| And if we can come close to a two-for-one package, I think that's what we at least look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| I mean, nobody's even open to looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| That's what concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| I think Dr. McIntyre has looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2338)|
| 0:39:06| But I don't remember off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| So if you would speak to that, I'd appreciate it, because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Commissioner, we did have the conversation this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| My take on that at this point in time is we are, you know, I did a lot of homework this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| based on the conversation that we had, and wanted to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| And we had done a great deal of due diligence already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| But I wanted to go back and take another closer look based on some of the assertions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| and ideas that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| I think we gained a lot of insight and some additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| And so there are some things that I do want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| And there are some, I think you have a memorandum that I sent to the Board about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| And there are a couple of things that I do want to do that will be modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| I think we can save some money in a variety of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| One of the things that I've done is really specified more clearly what the renovation looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| and that we're going to do, you know, some of the things that came up last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| We're going to do the windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| We're going to do the painting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| We're going to do the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| All those things that we've talked about, we're going to do those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| And they're in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| And we've specified them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| We have looked at other modifications to that recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2414)|
| 0:40:23| include that the middle school gym be built with a pre-engineered metal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| And we think that will save about $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| That's the design of some of the schools that we've talked about in the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| that have been done fairly cost-effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| Paulette and Fairview Elementary School up in Anderson County and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| We think we can save some money there and then put that toward the renovation at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| And that will allow us to commit to doing the painting, the windows, the lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| and things of that nature in the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I think we've come to the conclusion that we can take a look at our program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| And, you know, we do things like for the new schools that we've built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| we do things like cubbies, a whole section of the classroom for cubbies, a teacher office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| You know, are those things that are necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Or if we built a classroom that had additional square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| but without those amenities, we could probably save some dollars there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| and still have a great educational space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| And then finally, and this goes more to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| when we look at the Southwest Elementary School, what I've recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| and the law director is reviewing whether this is appropriate for us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| but what I've recommended is that we do a design competition for the Southwest Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| because I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| In this economy, there are some savings to be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| And that we've budgeted or we've estimated $15.5 million for construction of the Southwest Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2506)|
| 0:41:55| That could come in a little bit less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| That could come in, particularly if we do a design competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| There may be some cost savings associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Do I think it would be, you know, do I think that we would be able to build two schools for $22 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| And we've done some analysis that's attached to my memorandum of what we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| even with some of those program modifications, we still think it will cost at least $8 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2536)|
| 0:42:24| to build a new Carter Elementary School with a total, that's construction cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| with a total cost of the project of $13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| So that's an additional $10 million over what we've been talking about in terms of a renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| And that's a huge amount of debt for the county and for Knox County Schools to take on at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| when we're, you know, we're fiscally challenged, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| So we're trying to be fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| We're trying to do things that are educationally appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| But I don't see us being able to garner the kind of savings that you envision by doing a bid for two at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2570)|
| 0:42:59| And furthermore, you know, my recommendation to the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| based on lots of school visits this summer into other schools in our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| talking with lots of contractors and architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| my recommendation is that we take what is a sound structure and renovate Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| to make it what will be a great school facility when this project is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Dr. McIntyre, I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| My name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| I'm the superintendent of schools, and I'm at 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| I'm going to speak on behalf of the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| You know, elections have consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| And we just had an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| And overwhelmingly, in those school board elections, folks won who said they were for a new Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2621)|
| 0:43:50| They won those elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| Now, yeah, we're sitting here now, and in a few hours, I'm not going to be sitting here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| I didn't run for re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Some of us that are sitting here now are going to be gone next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| We can strong arm it, and we can pass this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| And we can pass this the way that it's been sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| And those school board members who ran on the platform that they were in favor of a new Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| will never even get a chance to speak on behalf of that because it will already be settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2664)|
| 0:44:32| Now, we can be bullies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| We're a big government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| We have the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| We can be bullies, and we can pass this as it's sent to us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| Or we can postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| Now, I know I'm stubborn, and we've been fighting this battle a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| and we've been butting heads, and I'm as stubborn as anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| And I would challenge that folks on the other side of the aisle are just as stubborn as me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| I do have the decency to admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| And I'm ready to vote to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| I'm ready to vote to say, let's let some fresh new folks look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| Let's let them make the final decision, especially when the people of Knox County have overwhelmingly sent a message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2708)|
| 0:45:17| by electing folks that were in favor of building a new school rather than renovating an old school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2717)|
| 0:45:25| And so, you know, we can puff up, and we can pass this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| and not give these folks a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Or we can be mature and we can say, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| Air time is done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| A new day is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| We have a new commission, a new school board, a new mayor's office, a new government that hopefully will get along better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2742)|
| 0:45:52| than we've gotten along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| We can pass it for 30 days in the hopes that the next Knox County commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| and the next Knox County school board and the next Knox County mayor can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| and build a new Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| So that's why I'm voting to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2770)|
| 0:46:18| And if you want to vote, if you want to vote on this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| the question I ask you is, what are you afraid of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Why are you in such a hurry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| What are you afraid of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Well, I really just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| This probably is for Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| And this is just the structure of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| If the new school board comes on, can they reconsider the capital plan at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Maybe it's for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| I don't know how to direct a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| I'm just trying to get my arms around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| Okay, so we've given them this thing that they may or may not, that you all may or may not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| Can it be reconsidered by the board is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| Commissioner McKenzie, I mean, I think that if we put it on the agenda, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| But I'm not sure if I would want to put that on their very first agenda, their very first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2842)|
| 0:47:32| Well, but that sounds like that's what we would do by today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| And that's really kind of what Commissioner Briggs was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| And I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| It's really, regardless of how you fall on the issue, I want us to get back in our lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| I mean, the school board has a function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| County Commission has a function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Right now, we're playing in you all's, you know, sandbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| And that's just, that's not the structure of local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| So I would prefer for, you know, as we voted, as Commissioner Lambert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| I mean, there's going to be a bunch of new school board members that's going to take office shortly after September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2888)|
| 0:48:16| I would rather one of them bring it to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| And again, you all debate that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| And if you all come back to us and say, no, we want to change the capital plan by X amount of million dollars in order to build a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2902)|
| 0:48:31| then, you know, I think we would hopefully have no problems pushing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| I would just like to, just to comment that the board had no intention of trying to rush this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| We voted on it originally back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| It was a unanimous 9-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| It was not an issue that was a big deal in most of the school board races at that time at all, as far as I was aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2927)|
| 0:48:56| And things obviously changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| It became a higher visibility issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| But when we did vote on it in March, there were people who were pleased that we were finally moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| And there is a sense that the board has a sense of urgency because we want to fix the problems at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| It's not that, you know, and delay does delay that once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| So that is one of the reasons that we wanted to continue moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| But there was no motive on the board to try to push this through to prevent the new board members from doing it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| No, I wasn't implying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| I just didn't know from a mechanics standpoint, if we vote this, you know, down today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| are they restricted from bringing it back up in October, November, some other time doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| I'm not sure about the parliamentary procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| We had an 8-1 vote, whatever, two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| And, you know, the one no vote is no longer going to be a member of the board by September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=2993)|
| 0:50:01| So the prevailing party, there will be some, you know, I'd have to review the parliamentary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| If the law director has some guidance on that, he can tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| You know, and then the second piece of this, and I guess I'm saying this because I have the mic in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| and that's Commissioner Harmon touched on it, but I just want to kind of just say it outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| And we've heard it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| We have the lowest tax rate of any urban area in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| We've decreased the size of county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| The Sheriff's Department is running more streamlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| We have really plateaued the growth within the education part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3045)|
| 0:50:53| We're going to have to make some serious decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| And I know we have a new mayor coming in, and he's made some strong statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| but we're pretty lean right now, you know, in terms of county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| There was fat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| We've trimmed a lot of that away is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| We're going to have to make some big girl, big boy decisions on how we want to go forward as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| And that's folks in the audience, folks listening as well, about our tax structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| We need to have a serious conversation about what we want to do to fund these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| We can't, you know, continue to slash and slash and slash, and our facilities and our structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| and our educators go without year after year without, you know, the proper progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| So, you know, I'm taking this as a, you know, as a charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| I'm throwing the gauntlet down and saying the big nasty T word, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| but we're going to have to look at how, what our tax structure looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| I mean, you know, it's great not to have raised it since, I guess, 2001 and all that, or 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| but, you know, we are charged with trying to deliver a product for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3114)|
| 0:52:02| trying to manage these dollars wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| And we'll continue to show due diligence, and we're going to cut where cutting's due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| but at some point, you know, we are a growing county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| We have aging facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| So, you know, I guess that's a charge to the community to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| hey, we're going to have to get behind this at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| We're going to have to have a strong, serious conversation about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| because this is, you know, this is tough to talk about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| whether to replace the school that's been here a long time or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| but, you know, that's the balance that we're charged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Dr. Rohl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| I wanted to thank Commissioner Harmon for what he said, because it's absolutely the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| There have been many opportunities that we've had to cut funding in other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| and dedicated to education, and as a commission, we've chosen not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| And then when a community comes to us and wants us to build them a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| and we want to do it, there's not the money to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| So, I hope that we will take note of that moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| and also pay attention to what Commissioner McKenzie has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| I see people out in the audience who really want us to spend money on a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| but when we start talking about taxes, you start shaking your heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| There's really, at some point, we have to have, we have to raise the revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| If we're going to have brand new facilities, we have to be able to pay for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| and we pay for those out of tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| So, we are going to have to have this discussion at some point, and it's going to have to happen soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| I am in favor of, I know that I have been concerned all summer that the school board wanted this in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| If we had approved it at the appropriate time, a lot of this work could be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| Right now, those students are back at school at Carter in a facility that's not up to standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| And we could have gone far, I think, before school started to get some of that work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| I would like to know from Ms. Kincannon and from Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| what, and you spoke about this a little bit, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| that since you went back and looked at things again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| what specifically are, you've said, made changes to lighting, to paint, to those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3276)|
| 0:54:44| And I'm wondering, what is it that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3284)|
| 0:54:52| I understand that the school, or that the community really, really, really wants this new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| and they just don't think that the renovations are going to be adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| And I'm just, I'm having a real hard time understanding, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| I guess what I'm saying is that I feel like Dr. McIntyre and the school board have done your due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| and that you would not be recommending this if you didn't think that this was the best way to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| for Carter, for the entire county, for our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| And I guess I just want to hear from each side what has not yet been addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3327)|
| 0:55:37| or why are these renovations just simply not sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| I mean, I understand that you all believe that they're sufficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| and I certainly, based on the track record that the county school board has had on doing renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| because we don't generally build new schools, we renovate what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| My own children go to a school that's older than Carter, and that's had several renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| I live in a house, actually, that's older than Carter, that still needs some renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| But this is what our school has a record of doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| not of building new schools and communities, but of renovating existing structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| They have a very, very good record of doing it, of creating renovations that the community's proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| that meet our standards, that come in on budget, on time, with the exception, I think, of one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| Although I've been told, and perhaps you all would like to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| that the reason they come in on time and on budget is because certain parts of plans have been jettisoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| and the full renovations have not been done to make them come in on time and on budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| Is there any truth to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3415)|
| 0:57:03| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| Of course, I've only been here two years, but my understanding is that we have a very strong track record on renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| We just did a school visit at Powell Middle School just a few days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| and it's a magnificent facility, and it's not a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| It's a renovation, and did a fabulous job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| I think Halston Middle School is an example of a major renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| where we made a very large investment, and it's a beautiful facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| one that you can be very proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| So my understanding is that our track record on renovations is very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| that we generally do come in on budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| unless there is a change that is driven by the school board in terms of program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| I think there's been a couple instances, or maybe just one or two instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| where the school board has changed the scope of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| and therefore the total cost of the project has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| But generally speaking, my understanding is that we have a very good track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| in terms of coming in on budget with major renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| Elementary was built a few years before Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| and we're doing a major renovation, a major investment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| And again, from everything that I've learned in this business, it is cost-effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| If you have a solid structure, it's cost-effective to be able to renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| and sometimes add to that structure, rather than start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| It's a more efficient and fiscally sound use of taxpayer resources to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| And again, our goal, Ms. Kincannon said it, our goal is the same as everyone's goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| and that is to have a safe, healthy, inviting learning environment for all of our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| everywhere across the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| And we may disagree on how we get there, but that's our goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| and we believe we can accomplish that with this renovation for Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| So the rumor that the only reason you guys come in on budget and on schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| is because you chop parts of the original renovation off to be able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3542)|
| 0:59:09| is that true or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| That's not my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| I mean, in any project, and Mr. Dillingham is here, who's our facilities supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| and he can speak to this better than I can, but my understanding is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| sometimes there are situations where Ball Camp is actually an example where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| we had to look at the scope of the project when bids came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| to make sure that we could fit within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| But were there major pieces of it cut out? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| You know, it's just making sure, and that's pretty routine in the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| of doing construction and doing renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| that you look at the value you're getting and making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| what you have resources for, you can accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| So, no, I wouldn't say that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| I think we have a very strong track record on accomplishing what we set to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| within our budget on renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| I've also heard concerns that the renovations that you have proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| are not adequate when it comes to the problems with the sewer system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| and with the previous mold problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| And what I hear from the Carter community and from leadership in the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| is very, very different from what I hear you all saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| So can you address that for me, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| And I think part of what the commission, individual commissioners asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| and I think this is the fifth time we've talked about this capital improvement this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| I think it is, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| But part of what was requested was more specificity on what the renovation looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| And I think the memorandum that I provided to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| and then subsequently to the commission really speaks to the specifics of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| So we, in terms of windows, in terms of painting, in terms of lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| in terms of HVAC, in terms of plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| And I have said publicly, and I will commit to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| if there are environmental issues that we identify as part of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| we'll address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| We think that the HVAC, which is going to be really a new HVAC system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| is going to take care of any moisture or air quality issues that might exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| We're going to abate the asbestos tile that's in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| We're going to do some major renovations to the restrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| and put in sinks in some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| So we're going to do some plumbing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| I'm told that the plumbing, while it did stop up one time, is sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| And if we need to replace the main sewer, we'll replace the main sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| But we don't think, we don't anticipate that we're going to need to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| because we think it's in fine working order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| And so, but what I've heard from leadership in the 8th District is that they disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| So do we have documentation of studies that have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| on the existing sewer system that make you think it's okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| Or existing documentation from you guys that shows why you think it's not okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| Or is any of this documented on either side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| No, we, I mean, we had, we did have a backup at one point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| And it came up, you know, sewage came up, got stopped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| Sewage came up through the piping and into a water fountain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| which is really unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| But we replaced the water fountain, we replaced that piping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| The main sewer line, to the best of the expertise that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| from folks in our facilities and maintenance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| who work on these things all day long, every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| is that that main sewer line is in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| Now, if we find that to not be the case, we'll replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| But we anticipate that we won't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| We believe it's in good working order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| And you guys obviously think differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| And what's the evidence that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Well, Commissioner, we've had testimony from people who've lived in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| who have experienced it firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| The thing that bothers me most of all about Dr. McIntyre's particular approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| to your questions right now is, as he just flat told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| he has no documentation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| We have got people who have lived in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| been with that building and know that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| And I've had prior commissioners tell me about their experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| in standing there when sewer not only flows up through the fountains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| but into the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| But you don't have any documentation of that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Yes, I can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| I'll have to call and get it done because we have the repair bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| You ought to have the repair bills of what's happened at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| since it's been repaired, since your facility and Mr. Dillingham's over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| But I have people who have witnessed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| people who were called down there to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| who can come and testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| But the real issue here is this and what concerns me even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| And my whole issue about this school was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| we're spending so much money to repair an old school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| and what I'm hearing from my superintendent here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| is that don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| We'll fix it as we discover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| We're not sure whether we need to or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| but we'll come back for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| And by the time it's said and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| I have $13 million into Carter Elementary School when I only need $8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| Well, my understanding...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| When we're coming to county commission and we're asking for money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| this is basic elementary stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| You do a risk assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| You do a cost-benefit analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| You do a cost-utility analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| You do a comparative and alternative analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| You do an environmental assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| You look at an alternative assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| You look at whether you're going to do a no-action alternative or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| Those are just basic elementary things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| Those documents should be in our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| We haven't seen anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| I don't know what's going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| It's not my place to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| But it is my place to make a fiduciary decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| whether I'm going to spend $5 million as we go along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| or whether we're going to have a solid, fact-based, driven request for this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| with fiduciary responsibility to fund those requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| I haven't seen any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| When our board member requested this, I'm not going to say who went ballistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| but he got eaten alive over the request of a risk assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| That is basic elementary, first-step stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| when you're going to look whether you're going to build a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| whether you're going to renovate a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| whether you're not even going to build a new school or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| but you're just going to renovate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| I still got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| I was answering your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| I know. I know. I'm trying to just move it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| I understand that and appreciate it, but I also have to balance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| on what the history of Knox County Schools is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| They have done, up until now, I believe, 147 renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| And they, in my opinion, having seen their renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| and experienced how they go through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| they do a good job and they do know what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| and they do know what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| And 25% of the schools in Knox County are as old or older than Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| Carter's not the only school that's had various environmental problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| I'm certain there are others that have had issues that have had to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| we've dealt with abatement and with repairs and with renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| And I understand the desire to have a brand new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| And I don't believe that once these renovations get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| that it's going to turn into a money pit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| I think that our school system has a better grasp on the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| and a better understanding of the issues involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| and a very excellent track record when it comes to doing these sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| And also I agree, also very much so with Dr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| and his concern that this is not, we are playing in somebody else's sandbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| It's not up to us to tell them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| They decide for themselves and they've been trying to get this done since March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| And we keep gumming up the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| We could have had some of this done so that the kids at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| would be in a better environment right this minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| And we've kept that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| And I'm not happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| This has gone, I guess, about what I would call my limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| We need to focus for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| The thing that I have problems with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| is the fact that I have just scurried around on three or four pieces of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| and I have a completely disorganized view of what's taking place at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4073)|
| 1:08:02| First, let me say I thank Dr. Briggs for having the copies of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| not what I'll call the lawsuit, but what he called the order of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4089)|
| 1:08:16| And then I'd also like to use his words again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4096)|
| 1:08:26| money that has been previously appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| I think that when I asked this question the very first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| when I stood around over here or sat here and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| wait just a second, where are we at, what are we doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| we were on the capital plan and it took me a moment to get to where we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| to ask a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| What's proposed and how much is it going to cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| And I think since those two questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| the entire exercise has doubled up with questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| Every time we get one, we get two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| And we've continued to go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| And I see more questions coming out of what we're doing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| On the one hand, we're saying we're holding up progress at Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| when this is a two-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| It's $2 million in this capital year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| It's $3 million in the next capital year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| There are no drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| There's no bid out for people to come and respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| to what needs to be done at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| The kids are in school out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I was there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| The real reason that I was there today is I need to jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| to what I consider to be a new next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| It has to do with drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| We're going to have a stormwater hearing next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| One of the things that's proposed in the current verbiage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| is that east and south of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| we're going to do a swale, whatever that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4202)|
| 1:10:10| to help with the water running around the corner of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| When the original building was built on the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| it was four classrooms, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| And out of the middle and the back of it, it was teed off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| And the property run downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| And we build on in 55, in 60-something, in 70-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| We just kept building straight away from the T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| And we blocked up natural drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| And I believe, that's just my unprofessional opinion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| that's where we've run into problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| We've backed up normal drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| We've collected it for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| And it has caused what some people to perceive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| as being a health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| One of the ladies at one of the recent school board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| stood up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| it's a good thing Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| and I may be paraphrasing, but it's on the tape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| it's a good thing Knox County allowed me to move my two kids to Sunnyview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| And I assume from that, it could have been litigious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| if she was still at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| I'm way off my rundown of things that have been said here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| We talked about the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| We talked about Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| I really appreciate what you said a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| And that in these economic times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| we need to be building school buildings square, steel, and brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| And I believe that was really the starting point for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| And where do we go, and what do we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| about how much money is spent on school buildings in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| I say that only to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| Ms. Chairman of School Board saying just a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| I expect the new school board, and then I sort of wandered off into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| I expect new school board to do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| I would think that we could allow new school board to do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| It's new school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| I was there at the last two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| I know that the issue of Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| was not the discussion two nights in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| I know that the discussion at the last two school board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| the work session and the regular session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| was about how to declare this an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| and get it considered by the sitting, still in place right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| today, school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| I don't know why, but that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| Somewhere in there I got the next words, which were high quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| I'm going to skip that for a moment because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| the one that I wrote down right after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| was a $3 million renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| Now I go back to where I started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Is the renovation at Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| $2.1 of the $5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| Or is it now $3 million of a $5 million figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| You'll notice that I say $5 million in all these sentences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| because it seems as though the bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| the thing that we had to back out of, that's the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| When you know the answer, you can always come up with what's above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| It looks to me like the bottom line has always been $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| And at that, I think I've heard us say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| that we're going to still end up with a renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| which is below standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| I don't know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| Does that mean we don't have enough square feet in the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| Does it mean that we're overcrowded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| when we get through polishing the wood floors up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| I do not really understand how we can have high quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| and meet standard when there's no way of doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| with the walls that we've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| And I'm not going to say anything about those little red doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| that you throw the kids out when the building's on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| Something else that really strikes my fancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| about what's taking place tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| is that when we try to direct the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| toward Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| which is what school board brought us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| I'm, uh, Ms. Broyles, I'm not picking on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| but you mentioned to us Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| No, you mentioned to me Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| So I've driven by Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| I've been to Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| I've been to Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| These are some that will come up here in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| I know that we're proposing a new school out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| The question's been asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| no, the comment's been made somewhere along here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| in the comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| We've elevated Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| to do it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| to $13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| But I thought in that same sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| $15 million was the number that was used out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| Something in that math falls apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| because how many seats are being provided for $13 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| and how many seats are being provided for $15 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| If I go back and look in the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| back three or four months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| was it 750 or 1,000 or 1,200 that's out west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| It's costing more per seat to build a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| elementary school east than it's costing per seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| to build a new elementary school out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| I'm not vouching for these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| I'm just saying that we've been taped and I made notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| I think I'm raising questions which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| eventually we're going to have to identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| We don't have the money to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| being Ms. Kincannon's statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| But we don't have money to do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| We don't have drawings nor bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| It's a sound structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| I ask at Powell, and I'm asking a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| that may open a can of worms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| at Powell or Holston or Cedar Bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| I don't remember walking on any earth crawlspace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| covered by wooden floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Now, they may exist in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| but the reason I don't want to bring those to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| is because what's been brought to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| is Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| If it were not for the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| bringing us Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| I wouldn't be talking about it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| I'm not talking tonight about Chilhowee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| I'm not talking tonight about some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| major renovation that's taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| over the next three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| like Carter Elementary's taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| over the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Chilhowee and someone's taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| over the next three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| I'm trying to help us focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| what we've identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| and where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| and what we need to take as a next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| As I say, I'll say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| well, no, I need to back up and say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| While I was at Carter Elementary today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4651)|
| 1:17:39| I got back on Highway 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| and was up almost to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| turning left on Straw Plains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| and I remembered Dr. Bratton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| making a comment about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| are we reusing the transformers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| And I turned around and I went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| to look and see where the transformers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| I don't know if I'm in the right place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| with transformers or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| but I believe they're sitting outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| the middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| toward the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| and they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| in the middle of the gym floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| And is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| just following up on Mr. Bratton's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| is that $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| or is that $600,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| We don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| or at least I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| I think that I've asked the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| about what do we propose to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| and how much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| are we going to spend to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| and I believe we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| all kinds of things added to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| I'm happy with the list as it's growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| because it means more things are going to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| for sure, for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| being added into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| adding into the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| And are we doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| without asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| what's the cost benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| what's some of those technical terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| that Commissioner Armstrong put on us just a second ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| You'll notice I took notes from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| I really think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| we're at a point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| that we're not facing an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| that we are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| questions about funding in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| and that I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| if I stand alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| I'm still asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| what can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| for Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| and the further we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| the more convinced I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| that we can't make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| back there in that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| We're blocking drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| You remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| said we proposed to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| four new classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| and from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| the plan has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| I said that kind of tongue-in-cheek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| I thought you might snicker a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| because it does say in the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| proposed four new classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| Now four new classrooms are added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| But we've got to take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| the boiler room. Somewhere along in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| that was added in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| There are just so many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| that make it an unacceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| project for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| continue to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| questions and move us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| along at trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| to remain focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| because that's the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| that's been brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| What's the motion that's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| Substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| to revert back to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| And I defer the rest of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| time to Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| We're moving on. We don't have any more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| Well I was going to let Mr. Hammond have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Thank you Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| He woke up there on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| as you all know this is my last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| commission meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| my two number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| priorities pretty much all my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| has been children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| and our senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| I've built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| a house before and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| and I can tell you that when an amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| is brought to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| you're thinking I can do this and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| and you find out when you get into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| they forgot this, they forgot that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| they did this wrong, this had to be redone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| and guess whose expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| it was? Ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| So I keep hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| all this and I'm very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| with the Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| and that area as my mother had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| a business there my whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| life until about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| ten years ago so I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| a lot of Carter High grads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| this number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| just doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| make sense to me because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| there's too many things if you get in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| with the environmental we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| call in people to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| X amount of dollars on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| I'm even concerned if they've even got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| when all that is done that there's enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| money to even do what they said they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| going to do at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| And I feel like it's just a real band-aid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| and approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| I wish we could build new schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| for everywhere. I mean 7th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| we need a school at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| Adrian Burnett in a desperate way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| Mr. Smith and I will continue working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| on that. We're helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| out our 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| colleagues right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| just feel that the parents here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| have a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| legitimate concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| being with my husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4973)|

| 1:23:03| sick from mold and mildew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4983)|

| 1:23:07| with the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| and maintenance there of trying to keep things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| I tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| right now I could not let my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4993)|

| 1:23:19| reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| there's no telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| what a child could come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| contact with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| and this being a whole two year thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| it's not anything that could have been taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| right now before school started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| even if we decided this in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| I'm ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| really let these new school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| I'm not trying I know what the law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| but I am responsible to the 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| District and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| allotting the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| that gets spent and what it gets spent for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| and I really want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| some new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| ideals, new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| because there seems to be problem after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| problem coming up and there's this and there's this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| and there's that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| and by no means do I think we ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| hurry up and do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| without taking a step back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| I will totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| support our school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| and Mr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| you all have my full support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| but I have just so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| concerns at emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| and phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| and the people that I know in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| that don't feel like they're being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| I guess taken seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| or that maybe they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| as important as some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| in the west area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| of our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| I represent all of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| and I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| be able to allow the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| school board members who ran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| and told the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| 8th District people that they were for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| helping them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| I didn't say getting them a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| but to help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| to give them the opportunity to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| and that's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| I'm here, I have to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| and try to get the best for all of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| that's our future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| and to think that they don't have adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| lighting absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| disgusts me that we're sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| our kids to school and they may not even have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| adequate lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| so I just want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| I'm here to support the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| I'm absolutely here to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| our school board, I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| our new members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| on school board to get the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| to voice their opinions because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| they're going to be the ones representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| for the next four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| Commissioner Lutho| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| I'm going to defer to Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| I saw his light on before mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| so I know that you might not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| I did, so Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| if you'd like to and then if I could have the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| after that I'm free to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| Sure, thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| I'm not interested in a confrontation with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| India Kincaid and I like Thomas Deakins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| I like Karen Carson, I'm not so sure they like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| me, but I like them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| I have a lot of respect for what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| I think Jim McIntyre is an excellent school superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| I'm not interested in a confrontation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| I'm also not interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| overstepping my bounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| I'm not concerned about a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| because I do believe that as the funding body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| of Knox County that we have a responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| to come in and look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| how money is being spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| I will wholeheartedly agree that once that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| has been transferred to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| that's their prerogative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| they've got 100% carte blanche to do whatever they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| to do, but until that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| I believe that we can provide some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| I am in favor of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| new Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| I was before it before the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| I am before it after the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| and here's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| it's not because I'm trying to play to an audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| it's not really because I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| do anything other than what I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| is in the best interest of those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| I have toured Carter Elementary when the students were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Dr. McIntyre was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| the deficiencies have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| well documented, I don't need to do that again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| I have talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| to a number of parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| been to their meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| it's interesting that I have not had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| one, not one parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| or resident of the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| contact me or tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| I don't need a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| go ahead and renovate it, I'll be happy with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| not one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| so that tells me that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| widespread support that the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| there support the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| for this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| so why am I in favor of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| I've tried to do my due diligence here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| and I've tried to, as I said, I've attended the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| and I've also talked to people who build schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| I have tried to talk with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| who are into renovation and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| and I have to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| go back on my history on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| and I've been here six years and I appreciate the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| that I'll have an opportunity to be here for another four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| I remember well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| the debate on Hardin Valley High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| we were going to build a school for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| 1,100-1,200 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| there was great debate and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| then as to whether or not we should go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| and build it for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| we were looking at $40 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| we ended up spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| $50 million, somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| we found $10 million for Hardin Valley High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| my kids went to Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| before it was renovated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| and yes, they didn't have a cafeteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| they didn't have some of the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| but hey, it was a good school, good teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| they had a great experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| but from a structural standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| they were attending a rather old school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| but when we began to renovate Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| we were going to renovate a certain part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| but then the community came back and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| wait a minute, the people are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| the crews are here, let's build out Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| let's spend another million or so dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| then we go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| this new school which is in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| which is in Needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| the new elementary school in the Southwest Sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| and we've looked at different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| and we've looked at different opportunities there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| and we have come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| and we have found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| $18 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| for a new elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| in the Southwest Sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| now in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| my students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| two of my children went to Bearden High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| this was before the addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| renovation. I think they've done a really good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| there. I have no problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| with the renovations at Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| and the other renovations that have been mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| because I think that's quality work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| I would be in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| of renovation at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| if we didn't have 26 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| sitting out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| you see, a few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| ago the school board made the determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| that a Carter Elementary School was needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| that one needed to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| and they felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| so strongly about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| that they bought 26 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| so 26 acres of land is sitting out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| waiting for a school to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| it has been waiting and waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| and waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| the MPC did a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| I don't know if you've seen the study or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| I didn't know it existed until some people showed it to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| the MPC did a study and found out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| structurally speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| the only school in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| was Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| I asked the question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| disabilities and parents with special needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| and was told that if a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| brought a child to Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| here to four before any renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| where does that kid go to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| they can't go to Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| because it's not ADA compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| as we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| do we want to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| four or five million dollars to renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| it all gets back to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| to me this is the bottom line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| when the voters voted on a wheel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| and I was a part of that debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| and remember it well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| the residents of our community I believe were told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| that the money was going to go for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| this year in our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| I believe it's one and a half million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| of the wheel tax actually went to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| if all of the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| that was promised to our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| from the wheel tax went to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| we would have enough money to bill Carter Elementary today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| I really look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| when we talk about taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| and we look at how our monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| are being spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| I think we also need to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| what we have told our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| that we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| now having said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| I know that in eight days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| our world changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| we have new school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| new way of thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| there's going to be a new way of doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| we have new school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| we go to an 11 member body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| that's eight days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| I would like the opportunity to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| with the new mayor and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| and find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| where eight million dollars is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| can we find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| eight, nine million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| for this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| we found it for Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| we found it for the new elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| in the southwest sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| I believe that just maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| there may be a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| that we could find an extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| eight to nine million dollars for Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| not to say that other schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| in Knox County do not deserve attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| they do and I agree with my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| I want to have this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| I can't wait to have this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| on where we're going in education in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| we've got to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| and it will be painful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| but it is a discussion that needs to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| so I guess my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| colleagues I would just say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| that I'm going to vote in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| of waiting not because I want a confrontation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| not because I enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| the conflict that we have over this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| because out of the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| 100 items that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| been, that the school board has given us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| we've passed 99 of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| this is the only one that we're having any discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| over but I think it's a good discussion to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| I think we need to have this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| but I think that we are in a rare opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| to take Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| from worst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| to first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| so let's see if we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| by sitting down with the new administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| with the new folks that are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| and seeing if we can do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| if we can't do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| then I think that this is a whole different discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| and I'm not for prolonging this another three, six or eight months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| I'm ready to go ahead and have some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| decision here within the next 30 days or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| but I would like that opportunity to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| and thank you Mr. Chairman for allowing me to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| and I'll hush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| I agree a lot with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Commissioner Hayman said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| I do want to correct something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| when we voted on the will tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| it was going towards schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| it was going towards Hardin Valley High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| which the county side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| is paying for instead of the school side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| indirectly or directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| how you want to take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| we are paying for a school facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| that money really isn't available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| to give to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| out of the will tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| so I would say that out of that will tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| at least a third if not more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| is probably paying the bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| on Hardin Valley High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| when you start looking at the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| and you only see a million and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| of the will tax designated to the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| that's true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| but without that will tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| we would not have been able to borrow the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| to build Hardin Valley High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| and that doesn't show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| within the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| just a side note there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| Commissioner Hayman is right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| to the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| and right now there's only three of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| sitting on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| that were here when we settled the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| the lawsuit started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| when my father was on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| won on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| the major points of the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| it was the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| that decided to appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| Chancellor Bell's ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| when I was campaigning in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| 2002| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| it became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| very clear that the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| wanted this lawsuit settled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| one of the first things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| happened when we came on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| if you remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| we settled that lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| and part of that lawsuit settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| was just as Dr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| is that once we give the money to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| it's theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| they could stand here before us tonight and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| they'd build us a new school out there in Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| and tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| could change their mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| I don't think they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| but they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| I mean that's just the way it's set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| but I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| he's a man of his word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| I have complete faith in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| that she would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| whatever she said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| so they're not going to stand here and say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| on the other hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| we do need to give the new mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| the new school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| a chance to take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| see if there are some efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| within not just the school's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| but within the county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| that maybe we can find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| to take care of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| and I'm going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| voting in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5826)|
| 1:37:14| Seeing no other lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| we have several people that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| signed up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| I'd appreciate it at the lateness of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| that you would make your comments short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| Connelly Underwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5850)|
| 1:37:42| Name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5862)|

| 1:37:46| 1107 Cooper Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Starry Plains, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| Thank you Chairman Strickland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| and ladies and gentlemen of the Moss County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| for the opportunity to speak to you on this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| on behalf of the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Over the past three months you've heard from many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| experts in the construction industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| and now tonight you'll hear from four members of the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| all saying the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| The proposed renovation will not fix the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| of Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| and a new school is the best, most cost effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| and most viable long term solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| to this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| For some reason our pleas, statistics, arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| and sentences for the last eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| have fallen on deaf ears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| in the Andrew Johnson building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| I'm encouraged to come to you once again tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| at the dog and pony show two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| There's no need to rehash while we are here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| Dr. McIntyre has made his proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| and he's standing behind it no matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| Tonight here's the community's response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| We would rather have nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| than a half done repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| which is what's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| We would rather wait and work with the New Noss County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| to find the funding for a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| than be stuck with a patch job for the next 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| Why is the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| so adamant about a repair instead of a new school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| Why are some members of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| so close minded when it comes to a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| at Carter Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| I could not answer these questions until Wednesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| but at least now I have an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| After the emergency action was declared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| after our 8th district representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| was laughed at in front of 250 of his constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| and after the wishes of those constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| were ignored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| the oppression in the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| and the 8th district in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| is not as important to the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| as the rest of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| We'll be told that is not true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| but actions speak much louder than words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| The Carter community has been told on numerous occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| that we want the same things as the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| A clean, safe, healthy learning environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| for our kids to succeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| With all due respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| the Carter community also wants these actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| or these items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| We need a school in which the sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| does not back up into the cafeteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| water fountains and kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| All the latest and greatest fixtures in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| are useless if when you push the handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| the sewage does not leave the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| By the school system's own admission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| last Wednesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| sewer replacement is not included in the repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| it is a will-have-to-look-at-it item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| which begs the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| is the renovation being done to repair the bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| and other multitudes of issues to make it safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| or is it being done to make the school ADA compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| to lower lawsuit exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| We need a school that doesn't have to have mold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| cleaned out of the kitchen twice in the first week of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| If you want to see the mold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| I've got some items in a garbage bag in my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| We want a school that when the air conditioner goes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| in one part of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| we don't have to call a retired maintenance employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| to find out where the breaker panel is three days later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| We need a school where the PTO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| can rent blow-up toys for our AR carnival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| and set them up without having to unplug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| half of the items in the downstairs part of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| to get enough amperage to run these blowers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| We'd really like to send our kids to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| without feeling like we've got a cinema water bottle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| to drink throughout the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| We need to be able to send our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| to school for more than a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| before they go back on allergy medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| after they've been off of them since school was out in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| We need our kids to be able to go to a playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| play in a gym| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| that is clean and modern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| not one that was closed down 30 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| by the Noss County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| We need to have a school building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| that is equal to the staff and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| of Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| We are the number one rated elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| in East Tennessee and number five in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| Ms. Thompson and her staff are being asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| to travel the country and talk about what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| at Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| What more could they do with a full NASCAR-style toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| not a worn-out craftsman starter set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| handed down from their great-grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| We need a school that is at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| close to the program standards of Noss County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| The majority of classrooms in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| after repair is complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| will still be 700 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| There is one simple question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| When the repair is complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| will the entire school meet Noss County standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| Again, by the system's own admission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| the answer is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| Most of all, we need a new Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| How can we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| The majority of you say you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| the appropriate solution is a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| The incoming mayor thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| we need to look at all avenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| and see if we can find a way to build a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| I know there are jurisdictional concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| but there has got to be a way to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| these things for the good of the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| After all, the bottom line is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| the kids and teachers in the audience here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| are the ones suffering while the adults are arguing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| I spoke to the school board last Wednesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| It felt like I was back in the old USSR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| speaking to the Politburo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| Here's what the community heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| We know what's best for your kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| and your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| and you're going to love it when we're done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| Listen to the community tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| and listen to what the community is going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| to their representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| Our kids and staff deserve the same as every other child in Noss County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| We don't deserve a more than adequate facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| We deserve a new Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| So tonight I ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| on behalf of the faculty, staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| parents, community, students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| and future students of Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| to defer action on the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| presented by the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| Let's find a way to work together as Noss County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| to do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| in replacing a school building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| that is more than to serve its purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| After all, if we build it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| the awards we're winning will keep coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6188)|

| 1:43:50| I know it's been a long day for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| I will be as brief as I possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| the environmental concerns at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| I know other schools have environmental concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| but I don't know of any school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| that has the environmental concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| that Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| that exist at Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| and I do believe it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| very very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| through renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| to get rid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| all of those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| I believe Mr. Armstrong mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| that there had been a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| risk management assessment study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| includes something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| 12 or 13 items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| and several people have mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| that the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| that we have a new mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| a new board of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| and a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| board of commissioners coming on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| board after September the 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| for you to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| postpone this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| or delay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| until that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| could be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| that assessment study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| could be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| I think it probably is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| could be done within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| 30 days, 30 or 45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| If you would do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| I believe that we would all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| come out winners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part3?start=6332)|
