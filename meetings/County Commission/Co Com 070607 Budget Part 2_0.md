| 0:00:00| That's an increase of 59.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| That gets our staffing for the New South Knox Senior Center staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3)|
| 0:00:09| The Health Department has reworked their budget and gone back and reprioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=9)|
| 0:00:16| They wanted to carry some money forward from this year, and that would total $382,212.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=16)|
| 0:00:25| And there's a lot of just changes within the Health Department's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=25)|
| 0:00:29| We've worked closely with Mark Jones and the Board of Health on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=29)|
| 0:00:34| Miscellaneous, you'll see, is a reduction of $695,000 to help do some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=34)|
| 0:00:41| Register of Deeds, an increase of $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=41)|
| 0:00:47| We got several –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| The Register of Deeds cut theirs 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=48)|
| 0:00:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| We're moving money from their operating to their capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=54)|
| 0:00:58| They've got two different departments, one's operations and one's capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| So we're taking it out of operations and putting it in capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=62)|
| 0:01:06| And they're also increasing their fees $17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=66)|
| 0:01:09| So for the Register of Deeds, we're 12 to the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| We cut the $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=71)|
| 0:01:13| It actually came out of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| The rest of it came out of the DEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| And I'm just being reminded that 100% of what's in their capital is raised by fees from their office, which is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=79)|
| 0:01:28| Sheriff's Department, the biggest piece is going to be increase the courthouse security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| and also opening up the new pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| We're adding – we cut most of our line items back to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| And so when we cut the sheriff's utility budget back to last year, that didn't provide money for a new pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| So, John, is all that coming out of 69 – is that coming out of $69.50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| It's coming out of $69.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| We're reducing the $69.50 and increasing the sheriff's budget $250,000 for utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| And then we're also –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Let me stop you right there for just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| Because the other day I was talking about some of those same questions came up that we were going to give to the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| coming out of $99.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| Because we have $861,797, and they told me that $380,000 was going to the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=136)|
| 0:02:23| Yeah, that's the same money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Well, is it $69.50 or $99.50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| The department is $69.50 in line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| The one line item that we call other is a big piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| And it's all within that whole group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| I call it $69.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| But $99.50 is a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| Let me just go right through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Maybe you need to explain that to me because I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| What is $69.50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| $69.50 is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Is that an account unit or department number or what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| It's comparable to a department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Okay, what's the $99.50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| $99.50 would be a line item within that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| So it's a department of miscellaneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| So do you have a list there that you're reading from that we're going to take this $99.50, $69.50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=194)|
| 0:03:26| whatever account it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| And reduce it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Reduce it by –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Okay, so we need – are we going to roll it into the sheriff's budget, into all these people's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| So you'll have that for us before –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Yeah, it was provided at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| But we'll provide it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| We'll provide it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| I'm glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| And that was part of the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| I mean, part of the intent at the onset is we knew that we cut budgets a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| And we knew that when it came to the county commission, people would make appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| and we tried to make at least some provision so that when an appeal was granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| I just can't make it on this budget, that we'd be able to grant some of those requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| And that's exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| So if you revise it, we're going to see different numbers for each officeholder now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| The list isn't that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| I think they're really based on the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| We tried to address as many of those issues as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Fire prevention, a little bit more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| Public defender is going to bring in some of their own revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| and we wanted the budget to appropriately reflect their revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| And the public library, an additional $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| So it gets them just slightly more than last year's budget on their materials, but a little bit more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=289)|
| 0:04:57| So, yes, we have provided all these, and we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| These are line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| And so this would be, you know, we have the original budget proposal from the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| and these are amendments to the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| And so that's what we're asking the county commission to consider is the mayor's amended budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| So out of the $861 whatever, how much is left after you totaled all that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=316)|
| 0:05:25| Of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| Of the $99.50 account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Oh, okay, yeah, the $69.50, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| It would be $853,000, $853,809, and that's, you know, a comparable number of $726,000 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=331)|
| 0:05:39| So $40,000, $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| Yeah, $130,000 greater than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| No, out of $86,000, $861,000, how much is left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| $853,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| That's what you're spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| The departmental total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| You're just looking at one line item within that budget, but I'm looking at departmental total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| How much do you say is left in the whole department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Yeah, I'm just giving you whole department numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| After you take all that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| After we take all that out, it would be $853,000, and that would be the whole department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| And who is the department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| I mean, where do I go to the miscellaneous department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| I mean, what room are they in so I can find them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| Yeah, I mean, you know, it's listed as a line item, and that's just where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| I mean, it's comparable to last year, slightly up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| But if I need to go talk to them, who do I talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| You know, in that, I mean, part of that is, you know, we put in there $6,000 for each commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| and that's part of what's left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| Well, that's money that we're going to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| So out of the $853,000 that's left, is it all spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| Or have we got some left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| I think we're perilously close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Things happen during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| I mean, when you consider that we have over a $600 million budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| and we're $853,000 of which much is already committed to, that doesn't leave very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=432)|
| 0:07:20| How much is it committed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Out of the $853,000, how much is committed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| I couldn't give you a good number right now, but we'll spell it out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| We'll get a nice sheet for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| And does that take into account, I guess, is it $91,000, $92,000, dealing with salaries in a miscellaneous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| That takes all that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| It puts all of that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| I would just as soon consider that all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| One large piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| But we don't know how much is left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| Well, what I'm saying is, I feel like that as things come up during the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| you know, transfers out of miscellaneous have to be approved by the finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| and they go to finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| And this is a tight budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| But if you need money, why wouldn't you just put it as something on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| and say we need to appropriate this amount of money to cover this expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| That's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| What I don't like to do is I think it's smart financially to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| and say that we've got some money set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| and that we do a transfer so that we're not raising the whole budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| because I think when we go back and increase the total budget, once we start the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| that sends a bad signal to the financial markets that we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| once you set a budget, to live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Let me ask you one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Then I'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| In the overall budget, how much do we have, like you said, for unexpected stuff happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=523)|
| 0:08:54| How much do we have in this budget that we're going to approve that goes to nowhere right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| unless something happens or a department needs money or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| How much just money sitting around are we going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| I wouldn't characterize that as money sitting around in any respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| It's got to be sitting around if we're going to use it in case an air conditioner goes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| or something happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| I mean, how much money do we have in case something bad happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| Yeah, because I think that's a much better characterization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| because things do happen, like air conditioners go out, there's a leak in the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| or, you know, pipes burst in the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Things like that happen every single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| And it's only prudent to have some amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| I know we're getting to the how much of that money do we have sitting around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=577)|
| 0:09:44| So I think that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| If I come in and said I want to buy 20 new cars for a department, how much money do we have sitting around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=589)|
| 0:10:03| Yeah, we'll spell that out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| It's something less than that 853, and I think that's something smaller than what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=605)|
| 0:10:13| In the whole county, in everybody's budget, we've got, we don't know, it's going to be less than 853,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=613)|
| 0:10:22| Right, because some of the 853,000 is already committed, and we'll spell that out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| I think it's low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| We'd like to have a little bit more elbow room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| I think things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| I think John's made the one point that we try to get as much in this budget without having a tax increase as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| If you were doing a budget at home, you'd have a contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| And we had a contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| But as more and more requests were made by commission, we went in that contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| But I think every department, I know this, you know, I'm not, I'll use the sheriff's department as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| I think every department has a contingency built in somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| And our budget at home would not be done like this, Mr. Orms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| I'd be broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Borrowing $102 million with no revenue, no revenue stream to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| How do we pay $102 million back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| Get back to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| This 9950 account, John, is that how we're funding the 9370?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=685)|
| 0:11:35| By 9370, what do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Employee travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| You only have $40,000 there in that account, and that won't cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| Yeah, and the rest is coming out of the salary line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| It's coming out of the miscellaneous, this 9950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| It's coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| How are you funding this 9370 account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=714)|
| 0:12:07| It seems like we're not well prepared or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| Yeah, we are prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| It seems like we have to ask four or five times to try to get to an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=734)|
| 0:12:21| The question is, again, ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| The question is 9370, which is the employee travel account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| You've got an amount at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| My figure is the travel account is a lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| So are you taking this money out of the 9950 to fund this travel account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| It would be coming out of salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| I don't know where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| This 9950 is a miscellaneous account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| On 9370, you've got employee travel at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| The figures we've been given are more than $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| How are you funding the difference out of the 9950 account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| Is that where you're picking up this money to fund that travel allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| You're talking about the mayor's travel allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| I guess that's yours, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| That's the part now where I think Commissioner Moore asked that that be shown under compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| Well, no, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| I didn't ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Wait just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Let's go back to this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| First of all, this money was taken under false pretenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| Now, you took this money from the taxpayers of Knox County as a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| Was it in a line item as a travel allowance when you took it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| I'm not sure where it was located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Well, anyway, you took pay then as a travel allowance, $12,000 a year, I believe yours was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| Mine was under compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Well, it was in the travel allowance account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| How do we arrive at these figures as compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| The mayor is getting a $20,000 car allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| We pay him and county commission has to approve his salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| Is this a way to get around raising salaries without us doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| Who gave you the authority to take this money and say it's a compensation for salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| Now, I said up here the last time on this meeting up here, and we went from a travel allowance in less than five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=882)|
| 0:14:53| from a travel allowance to compensation to salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| So it may change to something else now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| But I want to know how an employee or the mayor or anybody, if we're furnishing them a car and a gas card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=902)|
| 0:15:12| how they're entitled to a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| And that's the way it came up in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| It was a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Now, you can change it again every time we catch you with something like that, but I feel like this is done wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| And I'm not trying to speak for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| I think he spoke last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| And I know he can't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| And he said he will address this head on with your next workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| And I think he admitted that possibly that was a non-trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=935)|
| 0:15:45| It was maybe it was more transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| It wasn't as transparent as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| And he would address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| And I'm not trying to defend one way or another today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| So what you're saying right now, though, is it's a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| Salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| And I think that's what the mayor said he would call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Then that means the mayor's is a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| I'm not going to address the mayor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| Well, I mean, that's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| You're saying these travel allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| I mean, all of a sudden they're a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| You're saying they're not travel allowances anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| But according to the Tennessee TC824-102, the county's mayor's compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=977)|
| 0:16:26| should be at least five percent higher than the salary paid to any other county constitutional officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| The salary, well, I'm going to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| But, anyway, we are to vote for any raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| The only raise that that mayor was entitled to, according to this code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| is a minimum of $2,335 unless county commission approves more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:49| So either if yours is salary, I can't say yours isn't, but the mayor's taking this illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| Or somebody is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| I mean, we've got to make up our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Is it travel allowance or salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Now, Commissioner, I would not make a statement if the mayor was taking anything out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| I'm not saying you all got it in line wrong to where it looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| But this has been a process that has been in place, according to my meeting with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| because I had the same curiosity that you had, meeting with John Troyer and John Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| This process has been in place over many, many administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| But if you have a recommendation about how you would like to have it changed so we can be prepared for the budget to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| approved when it comes before this commission, then we are standing here ready for any kind of recommendations you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| My recommendation would be there would be a line item right there showing us just exactly what you people make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| We will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Ms. Finch, you've made a comment that I guess the practice has been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| I mean, are you talking about other administrations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| According to what I have been able to find out for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| it's my understanding that those practices have been in place as it relates to other administrations regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| this particular line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Now, if it needs to be changed, that's what we're asking for direction from this commission to make those changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| and we appreciate Commissioner Pinkson's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| It's in your pay every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Mr. Schumpert says that he was allowed some kind of an expense account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| Expense account, travel line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| But it wasn't in his pay every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| He turned receipts in and had a separate check cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| It may be $800 a month, but he couldn't go over, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| I can't remember what he said, $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| But do we buy things on credit cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| I mean, things that would be considered an expense account for the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| You're talking about expenses for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Like if you all have credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| If you go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| I'm talking about if you want to go eat lunch, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| You know, that should be part of the expense account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Now, if you're getting $20,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| and you're spending another $15,000 or $20,000 eating out and everything on a credit card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| from what the previous administration probably had, you're saying it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| Well, I think that you have, Commissioner Pinkson and you, Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| have given this administration some direction as it relates to how we should go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| So those particular recommendations that Commissioner Pinkson has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| and Commissioner Moore has made, I think that we could take those, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| and put those in a process so that we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| What kind of, I mean, what kind of direction did we give you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| You have, Commissioner Pinkson has made a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| on how you would like to see it in the budget for this upcoming budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| Well, I'm speaking for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| We go back to these charge cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| Are we paying for these employees to eat every day on the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| Oh, I would think not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| If there are charges on charge cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Ms. Finch, I just went back through last month and cross-referenced everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| We've got some people that have these charge cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| they're eating two and three times a day and charging it to the county here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| not while they're out of town, in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| Well, there are occasions when administrative people will take staff to lunch on a business lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1220)|
| 0:20:29| and there might be some other persons with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| And there is a process in place where you're supposed to put your name on the lunch, the dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| and the name of the persons that participated in that particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| Well, you know, occasionally we take our staff to lunch too, but I pay for it out of my pocket, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| Well, you know, it seems funny to me that you go to Chick-fil-A, the Pizza Hut for $19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:57| Smoothie King for $7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| You know, these things, they run up a red flag to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| I'm not an accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Every one of them could be legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| But we've got charges on Sundays, you know, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| And things could happen on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| If you go to a conference, it might go from Thursday to Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Would anything happen at the Apple House?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| The Apple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Apple House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Apple Store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Apple Store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Anything happen there on Sundays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| I spent some time going through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| I just went through one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Maybe we need to go through all the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| But we're talking up here about cutting people's budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| The film company that you're, Commissioner Lambert, involved with, $20,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| And it looks to me like that just with one month, if we go back several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| we're going to be talking about several, maybe even $100,000 that we're feeding some of these employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| Now, I do not think that any employee in Knox County should be eating on a credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1315)|
| 0:22:04| I don't think you should take your people out and eat on it while you're here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| unless we open it up to every employee here that's in this city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| But I'm concerned about some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| And I'm new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| But I'm going to tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| I'm learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| We both are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| I'm going to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| This applies to every department up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| I'm chairman of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| I'm expecting a letter from every line item transfer why you need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| and why you're short before I'm going to make a recommendation to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| We've got to take charge of our government and turn it back to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Now, I really feel good about these appointments that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| We took a lot of heat from the press and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| But you see what's come out already in the county court clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| We took heat from Billy Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| And Billy's a Democrat and replaced a Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| So you can't say that's partisan politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| And then these other things are coming out here that we've been snookered on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| And I've only been here three years, not quite three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| This is my third budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| The first we voted on it a month, I think, after I got appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| So I didn't have any change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| We need to be a little bit more precise and be transparent on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| And I'm really catching a lot of heat from people in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| wanting something explained about these travel allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| I don't know whether anybody else is or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| But this nepotism, people haven't been calling me about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| but they're certainly calling me about these travel allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Now, Ms. Finch, I want to tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| I done a little check, and you're not furnished a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| so I'm not on you about travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| I think you're entitled to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| And also I've done some checking that you do a lot of running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| I'm not just talking about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| I haven't just picked this out of the clear blue sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| I've tried to put a little into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| But we've got to do something here, and I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| But on this miscellaneous account, I'm going to make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| that anything that's transferred out of that over $2,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| has to come before the commission and us approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Because, I mean, I don't know where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Right now it looks like some of it's coming out there into the travel allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| because the travel allowance sure doesn't meet this figure that you've given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| And I'm not on you, Ms. Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| I certainly think you do a great job, and I've told you that many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| And the people in South Knoxville have commented on how you run your meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| when you come over there, and you do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| June the 12th, June the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| But, Mr. Arms, would you mind coming to the podium just a moment, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| I see here you take a lot of out-of-town trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| Your job is a deputy mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| I believe you're the first deputy mayor that we've ever had here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| I don't know the whole history of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Well, I don't know that Tommy Shepard had one, did he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Could anybody here that was here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Mr. Frank Lutho, you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Maybe you can tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| He had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| He had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Mr. Horns, did you know whether or not he was here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| You were one of the older ones here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| I don't believe that that mayor, it was County Executive Shepard, had a chief official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:40| He had a chief of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Kathy Hamilton was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| You're talking about a deputy mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Kathy Hamilton was the chief fiscal officer, the chief financial officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| By the end of her tenure here, she was called chief of staff, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| I think that's my official title, chief of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| Chief of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| You do an awful lot of running out of town, I notice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| You stay on the road an awful lot going places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Is all of that conducting county business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| It certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| You certainly eat well, stay at some of the finer hotels, too, I notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| Would you mind telling me, in California here, let's see here if I can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| This is sort of out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| You stayed in one place out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| It's $917.58 at Hilton and Beverly Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| According to this, you checked in 4-2507.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| What was that meeting for out there, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| That's the milking conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| and we went with probably seven or eight people from our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| And the Cornerstone Foundation paid the majority of the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| and that's where the TAP program, the workshops on the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| You saw the folks lining up and talking about the teacher assessment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| That's part of the milking program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| You're saying we were reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| I'm not saying we were reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| I know we were reimbursed pieces of it, and I can find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| I'm not saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| How long were you there, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| We were there three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| Three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| I beg your pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| Ms. Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| We can hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| You know, I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| It just seemed to me like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| That was where Lisa Light won her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| It seems to me like, you know, your drug county commission in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| saying that's really what's got me teed off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| I don't think I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Dwight Vandervate drug us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| He said, you know, that we get this travel allowance like that and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| Well, now, let me tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| I get $150 every pay period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| I believe you get $471 and Dwight gets $471.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| I'll accept your statement as correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| I'm all right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| On mine, I take and go to these meetings that I'm required to attend to in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| I go out, and if people have a complaint and they've got a problem they want me to come and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| I use that, and I furnish my own car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Now, I don't have a credit card or a PR card, as you all call them, but they're still credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| You are furnished a car, and you're going to say, well, we're going to change that in another account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| But you are furnished a car and a charge card to charge your gas with, and so is Dwight Vandervate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Several other people in the office up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Why did you all run this through as a travel allowance if you weren't trying to hide something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1732)|
| 0:29:00| Why did you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| John Warner came in, and he told me that you had a criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| and you all were $30,000 in the market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| And he said your pay is based on this, this, and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| Well, on your education, if you all met those requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| why would you have to put it in a travel allowance to get it if you met that criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| I'm not sure of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| What I'm saying is he said your salaries are based on your educational and your expertise in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Let's take you, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Now, what's your salary, sir, $148,000 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| I think it's $136,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| It's $136,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| What did the travel allowance run it up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Well, $1,000 travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| I believe that's $148,000, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| If you were entitled to that $148,000 on your expertise and your experience in education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| why wouldn't you just gave that raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| Now, I was looking here also, and I probably voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| I don't know whether these things are lying out of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Mr. Troy may need to be up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Last year we had a 3% increase and a step raise for all county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| The mayor got over a 16% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| He was making $127,000 in October of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| I think the mayor's increase was based on Tennessee County Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| Just let me add, putting out a statement on what mayors in population zones should make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:49| And this mayor hadn't taken that salary, which is recommended by CTAS every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| They sent it out to the 95 county mayors and saying, based on your size, this is what this mayor should make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| This mayor turned it down three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| And then some judges, you know, the mayor has to be the highest paid elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:12| So in order to give some judges raises, this mayor accepted that pay level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| So he's making $1 more than judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| But I think that, and, John, you may help me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Pardon me for interrupting you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| There's something in the charter that says the mayor has to be the highest paid elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| That's in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| That's in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| 5% more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| So we have some judges who are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| It's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| It's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| It's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| The mayor's compensation is set by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| And it shall be, let's see, it shall be greater than the compensation paid any other elected county official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:56| Which includes our judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Judges are excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| That would be under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| The reference to that would be the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| The law director is tied to the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| The law director's salary is the same as that provided to the judges, to the circuit court and chancery court judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| And so the mayor then being the highest paid would make more than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:25| And I'm not here trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| But according to this right here, fiscal year 2006-2007, population of 400,000 and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:39| The statutory salary for the mayor of Knox County would be $112,114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| I can get the CTAS recommendation we had sent us last year for the pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| I mean for the pay level, not pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| You know, I'm not here to argue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| But, you know, as leaders, as leaders, we need to look after the people that are doing the work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| And if we're asking these people to bite bullets on their increases, we should take one on ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| Now, you may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| The people out there probably don't know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I think they think we make big bucks here on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| But did you know that your car allowance alone, even though you're getting a car furnished, is more than 60% of my salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:28| And I'm probably overpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| I just want to make it clear that we need to take care of these poor people out here that are doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| It makes me sick to look here at some of these people making $25,000 a year, and they're going to get a 2% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:47| You know, I think, and I don't know whether we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| I'm going to ask the law director this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| I think that there should be some way that we put a cap on some of these salaries of these people that are appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2034)|
| 0:34:03| that we control, have some control over it, because, you know, this 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| boy, when you're making $148,000 a year, of course, I take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| It's only $136,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| The travel allowance is $12,000 of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| You know, that's a mighty big raise for a man like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| when people out here are working for $20,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| But I would recommend to you and the mayor, since you're representing the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| that all credit cards be pulled immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| that everybody in that office be put on per diem just like county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| that all hotels and motel bills be prepaid like county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| or else you bring a ticket back where you paid for it and be reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| But I think all of those things need to stop because it looks to me like we're running a little bit rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| And I'm not blaming the mayor because he can't keep up with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| And he doesn't know what you're doing with your credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| He doesn't know what your name is, because I didn't find anything on you, on Cynthia or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:19| And he doesn't check them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| And we just need to control knowing how these taxpayers' money is being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| Now, I'm going to tell you, if you worked for me, some of you would be fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| because I feel like you've misused these credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| Now, they may be legit, but I want to see that they're legit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| So I'm going to make a recommendation they be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| I don't know whether it's Mike or Cynthia, but who in county government has credit cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:57| General Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| We can get you the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Hugh has the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| We can get that official list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| I know some people have turned them in within the last two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| or turned them back in and said, I'll just go with Perdena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| I know that the school system, all of them have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| I've checked them, all the highway department, everything has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| But now the mayor's office is the only place I've seen where food was charged here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| Well, I think John can probably, John Troyer can answer these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| I think credit cards that most employees have would only let them charge, like, supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| I think you, I don't know, is it the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| I mean, I think you all have executive cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| where your cards are taken anywhere for gas, food, bubble gum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| I don't think they're taken anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| I think there's categories like restaurants, gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| There's other employees that got cards, could not charge food or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Oh, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| The one we have has certain categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| You just can't use it for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| So how many people in county government have executive cards, I guess, if that's what they're called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| We can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Come on up here to the heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| Mike Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| I'm a purchasing agent for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| How many cards? Approximately 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| Most of the cards are set up for what we call general purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| which is a merchandise category code that the merchant has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| There's different merchandise category codes that each merchant would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| General purchases would be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| T&E would be travel and entertainment, which would incorporate food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| Another one would be FE, which is fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| And then the last one is UN, which is unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| I would say that you're asked the question about executive cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| What you're referring to are cards that have open purchase limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| They have most of those cards, well, all of those cards have a maximum of $4,999 monthly limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:25| with a single transaction limit of $49.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| We've got about 13 cards in the county that have that, those privileges, what they're called open cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:38| I may tell you that every card that we have that has privileges other than GP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| which is general purchases, supplies, things like that, have to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| There's an approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| It has to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| The recommendation has to be made by the department head of that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| The department head makes that recommendation to, in writing, to purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| And it has to be addressed to the senior director of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| And it's up to his discretion based upon the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| why the request is needed as to whether it's granted or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Let me stop you right there because I don't think there's a problem with the general purpose cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| I think they might be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Now, who's got the 13 open accounts with the $5,000, $49.99 limit a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:36| The mayor's office has those privileges, all of the staff under the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| which would include the people that fall under the employee of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:54| And there's two other cards, I believe, out there that are in the public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| and engineering department that was a special request to the supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:08| And also, I missed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| I missed another department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| The other request was for the great schools partnership under the direction of Ms. Kershaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:21| Those constitute the 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| Is the one to the great school, is that covered within the $6.5 million budget or is that extra revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| I don't speak to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| I can't speak to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| I speak to the request of what the request was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| That request was made by, once again, by the director of the great schools partnership, Ms. Kershaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| And it was made directly to Mr. Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| It's up to Mr. Warner to decide whether that is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:57| What is the accountability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| What is the flow from the purchase back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| Is that approved by the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Are you a comptroller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Each department has the accountability of the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| We have a procurement card manual in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| It has been audited by Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| I think Mr. Walls could speak to the accountability of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| But, basically, there is a reconciliation each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| Each department receives each cardholder, if they make a purchase, receives a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| And what they do, they take all those statements and reconcile them into one with a reconciliation statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| They submit that statement to the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| The finance department checks off those purchases because they get the master statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| monthly master statement from SunTrust Bank, who is the holder of the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| That's the accountability to the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| It's up to the individual department to administer the accountability to the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2514)|
| 0:42:03| It's up to the purchasing department to make sure that they are using the cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| that we are assigning the cards based upon the need and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| Now, when you say over 300 cards, and I believe the question to you was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:22| how many cards in the great Knox County government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Does that include schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Yes, sir, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| There are cards that are for the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| and that's under the administration of Roger Underwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| who is basically the overseer of the cards from the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| The request, once again, is the need for the, based upon the scope of the work of the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| the employee is up to the director or the department head of that department within the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| or whatever to make a recommendation of why they need a credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| And based upon that, then it's a process that the credit card request is made to Mr. Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:08| If you're speaking of the schools, it's made to Mr. Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| They submit a form to purchasing, and at that point in time, once I get that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| what I do then is contact that particular employee or that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| and I arrange a training class for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| Every employee that has a credit card has been trained, bar none, including the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:35| Not one person has a credit card that hasn't been trained of the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| They get a manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| They know what the accountabilities are of that card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| I read them the right act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| Now, let me slow you down just a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| I'm mainly trying to get at between, and I don't know, Lee, does the sheriff's department, do you fall under that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2635)|
| 0:44:03| Do you all have credit cards and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Yeah, we have credit cards to make airline reservations, hotel reservations, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| But not to, our employees don't have cards to go eat lunch on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| You're not paying your Comcast bill and your Waste Connections bill off your credit card then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| I'm just trying to get a handle on who has credit cards for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| Does that include, is any department separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| I mean, it's like the sheriff is standalone or the health department is standalone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| I mean, does the 350 include the sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| This one has a $2 million line of credit, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| Let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| I checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| The school's got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| The sheriff's department's got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Most all of these departments have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| But my question is, does it flow back to this guy that has come up here or to the accounting department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| All the departments flow back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Ron, how many credit cards do you all have in your 15, 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| You don't have to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:20| Commissioner, I'm not sure they're telling me 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| We could go back and check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| But they are subject to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| Mr. Rees is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| He's pretty stringent on what's an acceptable use of those cards and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| And those are reconciled each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| They are sent to the county finance department and they're verified over there and handled in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:47| But we can check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| I'm not sure what the exact number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| They're telling me 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Well, I don't want to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| But if you have us over here to the small assembly room and you furnished in or forced, does it come out of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| There's no employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| There are restrictions, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| And, Mike, you may have to help me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| But there are restrictions or limitations as to those purchases that, you know, you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| that the employee conceivably, if they tried to make a purchase, it would not be allowed, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| There are limitations on those cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Well, I want to tell you, I checked schools, too, and I didn't see anything out of line on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| I checked the highway department, the sheriff's department, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| I didn't see anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| The only thing I can say is that I saw a lot of things out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| You know, you're getting a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| I saw some gasoline charges on them credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| I mean, we can't have it both ways is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| I saw nothing at all wrong with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| But I just checked for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| I want everybody to know that was just last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| I'm going to yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Might as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| I mean, I just got this stuff today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| And I'll tell you, I am very, very concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| We have a film commissioner that doesn't have a travel budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| yet I'm seeing $917.58 worth of lodging in Hollywood, California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:21| where film commissions should actually be operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| You know, a lot of people talk about the big charges, but what about the small charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| the charges that are too small to be anything to do with county government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| Here's where an employee charged $7.67 at Smoothie King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| Now, I've stopped at Smoothie King, and that's about two milkshakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| That doesn't sound like you're getting smoothies for some sort of a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| Another thing that I have concern here is Mr. Pinkston, you actually said Apple Bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| and this is actually the Apple Store that something was charged at on a Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2873)|
| 0:48:00| Now, the Apple Store is a Macintosh computer store in Westtown Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| and they charged $54.63, looks like $49 and something in some tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:14| That doesn't sound like a piece of software you'd buy to run county government with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| That sounds like headphones or an iPod case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| It doesn't look like the sort of charge that you would think would be a government charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2902)|
| 0:48:30| It looks more like a charge that one might see on a person's personal credit card statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| Another one of my concerns is that I see in the mayor's office a lot of folks are getting company cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| nice new company cars, when our beer inspector is driving around in a nine-year-old car with 140,000 miles on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:52| and Mr. Trimmel tells me that there's a lot of our Knox County officers who are out there risking their lives in similar type vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2932)|
| 0:49:01| And then on top of the nice new company car, we have these very high travel allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:12| I mean, it sounds like you're giving folks a car and then you're paying them to drive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| And again, in some cases, paying folks more in travel allowance than some of their working poor citizens make in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:26| And I'm just saying that this is, I'm very concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| We've got a tight budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| We're not giving the library enough money to buy library books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| Yet it seems like from the looks of these credit card statements that some folks aren't exactly living lean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| Now, I just got this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| And that's why I'm not mentioning any names, because I'm going to contact some of these folks personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| There may be a legitimate explanation for it, but it just don't look good from where I'm sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| You know, Commissioner Lambert, that item at the Apple store down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| I thought we were tax exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| You'll notice they paid $3 and something tax on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| And, like I said, based on the price of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| There are several of these in here that we paid tax on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| I mean, that's and I went in the Apple store, looked at what they had that was around $50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| and, you know, an iPod case, iPod headphones, maybe a mouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| I mean, not software that you'd use to run a county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Mr. Walz, I've asked for some information from the mayor's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Have we received anything on that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| Not as of today, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| And, Mr. Law Director, is there a purchasing code that we have to go by when you have these credit cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| I mean, I take people out to lunch, and you can, you know, I'm not underfed, but, you know, I pay it out of my pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| I take people out to lunch, you know, as my position as a chief at the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| I mean, dignitaries visiting, I mean, I pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| The sheriff doesn't, or taxpayers don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| I don't get reimbursed from the sheriff for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| Are there procurement codes that could have been violated for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| Well, I don't know about violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Where does the money come from to pay these credit cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| What line item is that in in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| I don't know, but I want to tell you one thing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| I want to fess up this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| I didn't know it until a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Commissioner Arms bought my lunch one day at the Riverside Tavern, and he paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| But I didn't know he was paying for it on an accounting credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| He just informed me that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| But he did pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| He said, I'm paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| I just took for granted he was paying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| Another thing, this may sound chancy, but I want every commissioner up here to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| that your main job up here is what you're elected for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| You're to be the steward of the citizens of Knox County's tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| and to see that they're used properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| That is your number one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| These other things that we do, we just do through goodness of our heart, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| But that's our number one priority is take care of the tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| And if a poor little old nut like me can find some things that look wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| I don't know what a good accountant would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| Back to my question to Mr. Owings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| Is there a procurement code that we have to follow when we're buying lunch for people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| And we have pretty extensive regulations that apply to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:43| And I just got this today, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Do you see, have you looked at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| I have not seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| You know, I guess I need to do this at the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| but I definitely want somebody to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| I mean, there's charges for waste management and Comcast cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| Somebody's paying their cable bill and their trash pickup with a county credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3181)|
| 0:53:12| What page is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Commissioner Ivan Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| I guess this is for John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| John, at the last commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| John Warner more or less said that it was your responsibility to put their travel pay in the right position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| Did you make a mistake and put it in the wrong category in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:39| You don't want to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| It's okay if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| I just felt like John should be here, John Warner should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| But we appreciate what you've done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| I know you took a lot of heat, but I do appreciate the efforts you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| I think we can talk about where it should be and when it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| We've been here since five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| We've been here three and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| But, Mr. Arms, and we're not getting on anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| we appreciate what everybody does for the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| We just want to be, I think new commissioners want to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| and make sure they vote on a budget that they feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| So, I mean, you're wanting this thing passed next Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| You know, I would maybe look at what we need to do for a continuation budget for 30 days, even into July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3261)|
| 0:54:32| So, I mean, I want you all to be prepared for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| So if we don't have any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| Just a quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| I know the mayor's office has called each commissioner individually and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| have you got any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| But what I want to say, I think the mayor said he couldn't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3290)|

| 0:55:01| I don't think we're trying not to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Sometimes it's just difficult to get at this spot and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| how many credit cards you have and know all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| I mean, it's a lot of material to keep in the back of your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| And so any questions you have, I know, Commissioner, you asked about the paving budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| I looked into that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| So any specific questions, and I'm not trying to rush you at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| What I'm saying is if you have specific questions, get them to us in writing, e-mail them or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| Well, we've had some to you, Mike, since May 24th, and we still don't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| You get that to us for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Mr. Troyer knows what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| If it's expensive, I know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| We had to go over to Sears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| I think you asked for them four or five years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| No, we didn't ask for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| We literally had to go to the Sears warehouse to pull some of these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| Well, that's after the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| There will be plenty of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Well, let me ask Mr. Walz what we asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| I mean, how much time do you think it would take to pull what we asked for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| We asked for, I think, six current employees and one former employee, payroll records, credit card information and expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:19| And when did we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| May 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| And the day is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Two weeks for six people stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| And, you know, I don't think all that would be at the Sears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| No, I'm not trying to be defensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| I'm just making a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| If you have other questions about paving the budget, I was trying to be positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| If you've got other specific questions, give them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| We'll try to get them answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| But I think at the same time, you know, John's working yeoman's duty, just like he's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| I mean, a lot of our people are working long hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| We're not trying to hide anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| We're trying to be responsive and get you the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| It was just this morning that you asked a question about the paving budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| And I talked to Bruce and I can talk to you about our paving budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| We didn't even get to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| But I'll talk to you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| We'll talk on the phone tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| I got your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| I just want everybody to know, too, that the sheriff did supply the drinks tonight, but that was out of his pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| He paid for that out of his pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Maybe this is to John or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Commissioner Lambert just talked on it real quickly about the beer inspector needing a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| We'd like to see that in the budget, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| He's got 160,000 miles on his car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| And we may be able to find something in surplus with less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Or not in surplus, but something with less than that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| We'll look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Are we going home, Mr. Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| I think if we don't have any other questions, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| We thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart2?start=3475)|
