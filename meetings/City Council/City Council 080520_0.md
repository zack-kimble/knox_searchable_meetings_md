| 0:00:00| I'd like to go ahead and call the meeting to order, the May 20th meeting of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=0)|
| 0:00:25| Before we get started, I think all of you know, or most of you have heard, we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=25)|
| 0:00:29| an officer shooting involving one of our officers, Norman Rickman, who I think everybody on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=29)|
| 0:00:35| remembers has been head of the Police Benevolent Association, and you're not supposed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=35)|
| 0:00:39| favorites in this job, but Norman's one of the good guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=39)|
| 0:00:44| He is out of surgery now, and he's out of surgery but not out of the woods, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=44)|
| 0:00:49| we'll just put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| If you don't mind, I will ask the invocation for us tonight, if you'd please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=52)|
| 0:00:59| Father, we thank you for people like Norman who are willing to rush into dangerous situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=59)|
| 0:01:09| and we pray right now for him specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| We pray for your protection, we pray for your healing, that you would stop the bleeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=72)|
| 0:01:19| We pray that just for wisdom for the doctors, and for comfort for his family, and we thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=79)|
| 0:01:27| you again for Norman specifically, but more importantly, or I guess beyond that, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| for all the people who do what he does in order to have us have a safe city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| We also pray for this meeting tonight that you would give us wisdom and clarity as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| go about this business, and we thank you for the good gifts that you give to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| And, Vice Mayor Brown, if you'd lead us in the pledge, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=120)|
| 0:02:09| While I have the mic, if you'd like to, one way to help Officer Rick is, he has lost a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=129)|
| 0:02:18| lot of blood and will be in need of a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| If you want to go down any time in the next week and donate to MEDIC, that's always a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| In this case, it's specifically helpful, and if you would mention him, he won't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| pay for all the blood that he is going to need, so if you would specifically mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| Officer Rickman, you can go to MEDIC or one of the other places where you can give blood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| I know that he would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=158)|

| 0:03:17| First, I'd like to move item 10-C as in Charlie to postpone that for two weeks, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=197)|

| 0:03:42| Let me go ahead and vote on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=222)|

| 0:03:49| So it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| I want to make sure I say it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=230)|

| 0:03:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=235)|

| 0:03:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Second thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| There's something up on later on in the agenda that ultimately you're going to want to refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| it back to MPC 12-E rather than making the applicant sit around for something that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| applicant is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Or the attorney for the applicant is agreeing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| I'm asking everyone's indulgence to go ahead and request to move that up, to send that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| That's 12-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Mr. Daniels, I think, is the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Do you want to make a comment on that or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| No, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| If we could just move it to help the lady out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| There's no need in her paying me to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| And thank...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Mayor, I want to say thank you for being at the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| You know my background in law enforcement and it's great to see you and the Chief supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| the officers like you've supported them today with your thoughts, your prayers, and being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| there with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| I need a second to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Could we clarify that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| We're sending it back to MPC to consider C-1 for that particular parcel of property because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| the record does not reflect that C-1 was considered earlier and so that's the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| in sending it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| And the second accepts that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Anything else to deal with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Is it necessary to formally make motions to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| I move that we postpone item 9A, item 9B, 9C, and 9F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=332)|
| 0:05:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| A, B, and C are dealing with the budget and then the new salary structure and then 9...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| That's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Why don't we just vote on that separately and then we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| So let's vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Was there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| And then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| I move we postpone item 9F as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| That is, I think, about to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| 9F is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| And was that for two weeks or how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| I had been asked before to have it postponed for four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| I think I'm more comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| If we need...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| That would be for four weeks, 9F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Actually, there's a request in the fall to postpone until June 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=384)|

| 0:06:36| That's fine, for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| I guess somebody should point out that if you postpone it a few more weeks, it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| actually break the record for the longest postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| We're shooting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=401)|

| 0:09:03| The applicant in this cause, my address is 800 South Gay Street, Suite 1650.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| Are you familiar with the situation the Murphy family is having with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Oops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| The Murphy family has registered objection to probably everybody on city council about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=559)|
| 0:09:27| the use of the name, their family name, considering it's located on the street, and they had requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| Mr. Jernigan to try to come up with a different name, and he hadn't, Kevin Murphy, hadn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| gotten any response back from Mr. Jernigan, and that was as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=581)|
| 0:09:49| Mr. Jernigan and Mr. Murphy's in Boston on previously arranged business, and he was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| to ask for a two-week postponement, first to give your client the opportunity to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| Is our understanding, or my understanding through Mr. Murphy, that your client thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| there was another similar name that would prevent him from calling it Victor's, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=604)|
| 0:10:13| it ends up it's Vic's, which Mr. Jernigan also owns, and there is a legal difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| between Vic and Victor's, so he could call it Victor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| The Vic's package store is owned by his son, Garrett, and that may, the ABC may have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| problem with that if they're supposed to be distinct and separate entities if one is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| by the, I understand what you're saying, if one's going by the trade name of Vic's and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| one's going by the trade name of Victor's, and they happen to be related, that may cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| us a problem in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| I haven't talked to Mr. Jernigan about his intent for a possible name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| That's news to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| But the store's not ready to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| No, the store, the anticipated opening date for the store is October, and we anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=664)|
| 0:11:12| getting, being on the ABC agenda in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Of course, you have 90 days to become operational after the ABC approves, that puts us into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| September, and then you can get one 30-day extension, so that's what, that's the timetable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| I don't know, respectfully, Mr. Frost, I don't know if the statute that spells out the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=686)|
| 0:11:34| for certificate of compliance, if those have been met, despite the fact that some landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| has a problem with the use of a name, I don't know if legally the council can deny the certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| of compliance if we've met all the other requirements, and I would submit to this body that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| satisfied all the requirements, and we would ask that you, we would respectfully ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| you go ahead and approve the certificate of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| Mr. Swanson, is it within our power to postpone for two weeks, even if they've allegedly met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| the requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Well, if there's some things you need to investigate with regard to this, you can postpone for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| That doesn't necessarily mean you can deny the certificate of compliance, but you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| I'll move to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| I see other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| Discussion on this, is this on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Yeah, Mayor, I tried to call Victor today and yesterday, and I guess he's out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| And it was hard to get hold of his, who he had left to get in contact with, and I hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Nobody has any rights to any name Murphy or, you know, whatever the name is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| And so, and we are here to act on what has been put before us, and considering that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=766)|
| 0:12:56| not going to open up until October, you know, I think Victor probably would want to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| And I'm sure, in my representation of him, he's always been amenable to, I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| know what would have to happen if we passed it and then went back and had a name change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| And I would say, respectfully, that probably the best way to handle this, knowing Victor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| that if we postponed it, then we could get with the Murphys, because the Murphys probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| think that this is being named after their, I don't even know the history with their family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=804)|
| 0:13:32| but I assume that they think it's being named after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| So, I'm sure there's something we can work out, and I think I'm going to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| postponement, but I do understand what I'm here to decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| I was going to say, I've asked Mr. Swanson to find out directly, if possible, from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| ABC about the possibility of a Vic and a Victor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| I just want you to know where I'm coming from on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Mr. Becker, and then I'll come to you, Mr. Beal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| I guess, just real quick, we would be postponing this until June 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Is that before the ABC meeting you've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| You said it was in June, and I'm assuming, you know, that that's not June 1st or 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| ABC typically meets on the fourth Thursday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| So it sounds like there's time in all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=861)|

| 0:14:23| Well, my reason for supporting the postponement and inquiring about it earlier this week is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| simply that the Murphy family is happy to be doing business with Mr. Jernigan, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| understand that there is a different connotation to having one's name on the liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| And because of the name of the road, the name of the location, the family's prominence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| the appearance is that it would be their store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| And I think they're very sensitive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| And I know Mr. Jernigan well enough to know that I feel, too, that he would like very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| much to try to resolve this with the Murphys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| So the whole idea here is to give Mr. Jernigan and the Murphys an opportunity to work this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| out before we have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| And if I could just make one comment, Mayor, and I'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| I agree with the council persons that have spoke concerning my client and his willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| to resolve this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| Worst-case scenario, just so I can give him feedback, worst-case scenario, if he comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| to me and says, we're not going to change this because I know there's another Murphys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| Road partnership that he's involved in under the name of Murphys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| He comes to me and says, I'm not going to change the name, and you tell him on June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| 3rd, I'm not going to change the name, where does that put us then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| Or should I wait until June 3rd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| Wait until June 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| That's an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| And that's what we want to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| For the two parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| I think that's probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| All those in favor of a two-week postponement, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=969)|

| 0:16:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Real quick on Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| First I'm pleased to announce, I think a lot of you all know him, but that we have a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| neighborhood coordinator, David Massey, and David is here, and I'll ask him to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| maybe just so we can put a name with a face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| David has over 25 years' experience as a neighborhood leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| I think a lot of you all know him already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| He's been the executive director of Cornet, which is now Discovery T. He served on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1010)|
| 0:16:58| Better Building Board for us for three years as well, and he's already hit the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| I think we've only been paying him for about a week, but he's been around longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| I know meeting with a lot of different city departments and neighborhood leaders, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| David, we're very glad to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Anything you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Well, just that I'm really thrilled to have the opportunity to work again in neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| work and to help neighborhoods understand city government and help city government understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| where neighborhoods are coming from and working hard to help organize unorganized neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| and provide capacity building for the neighborhood organizations that do exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| It's a fantastic opportunity for me, and I think we'll go a long way toward helping build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| these wonderful neighborhoods for the good of the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1058)|

| 0:17:46| 45 years ago, David's wife was my next-door neighbor and babysitter, in the interest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| full disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Thanks, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Tomorrow, May 21st at 5.30, you can participate in Smart Trips Month by taking an afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| walk along Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| It's a great way to see a little bit of the past and also see what's in store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| There's a lot happening in what we call the downtown north area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| Bob Wetzel, our director of redevelopment, and Jack Neely, who I think everybody knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| is a Metropolis writer and local historian, will be leading the walk, and there'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| I think it'll be a really fun occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| It's a chance to get out tomorrow, 5.30, beginning ... Bill, do you know where they begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1103)|
| 0:18:32| On North Central?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| It's at the intersection of Summit Hill Drive and Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| That's what Bob's email said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| We're going to meet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Just meet there, and then I guess they walk down to Central and walk through the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| and go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| That's what I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| That could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| That's all I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| You know more than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| That could be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| It was in Bob's email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| That's all I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Until further notice of that, but I bet it'll be on the website as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| It already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| It already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| So, check there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| But I do think it'll be a fun late afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Also, just you might have noticed, there's lots and lots of smart, younger people around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| We have about 1,000 people here for the Destination Imagination Convention at the Global Finals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| at the Convention Center and other locations in conjunction with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| So, that's obviously both a great convention for the city and bringing a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| but it also is a great way to introduce people to Knoxville, and it's been a very successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| We're very thankful that they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| I don't want to put Councilman Woodhull on the spot, but yesterday he and I went over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| to the corner of Sutherland and Hollywood with the Pond Gap Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| and they spent about three years working with engineering to try to put a little, to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| some barriers up to allow for kids to cross the street and for the street-crossing lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| to have an area to buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| They took a lot of pride in what they did, and we went over and had a meeting, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| gave us a plaque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| We were supposed to present the plaque to you, Mayor, tonight, but we'll give it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| No, actually, I think that was to Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Who had done the real work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Mayor, you don't get a plaque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Thank you all for going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Mr. Becker, I'll just work my way around the circle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| I guess one announcement, assuming Mr. Frost will have the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| Just to announce publicly, next Thursday, the 29th at 5 o'clock, is the public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| We've done those every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| This year it is in the middle of our budget hearing, so it's a good time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| And then the legislative meetings are also open to the public, and I think that schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| is posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Well, I was just going to comment on another school, which is actually not in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| I guess I have to give you credit for this, but I'm going to sing their song.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| West High School is going to the state soccer tournament in Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| There's only one problem with that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| My grandson's high school soccer team, on which he is supposed to be their big scorer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| is going to be playing against them tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| So I have very divided loyalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| I just don't know how that will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| I thought I'd mention it tonight, because we may not want to talk about it, you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| if my grandson prevails, two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| But congratulations to West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Heck, they defeated my alma mater at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| So I have had very mixed feelings about this tournament in Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| We West High School parents have no divided loyalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| We call it Super Six District for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| I understand it, but I take such good care of your school, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1323)|

| 0:22:06| Monday is Honor Fountain City Day, Fountain City Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| This year the service is going to be conducted by former Channel 10 anchor Bill Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| This will be the first year in over two decades that Congressman Jimmy Duncan isn't going to be going over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| When I got the call from Michael Caine out of Fountain City Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| he said he had a serious question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| He said, who should replace Jimmy Duncan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| I was like, are you kidding me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| He's literally been there all the time, but the congressman is going to be out of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| But nevertheless, it's always a fun, family-friendly event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| a great showcase of the Fountain City community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| good food, good refreshments, good beverages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| and I would like to invite the public to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| Along with Councilman Becker's announcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| we also have our legislative budget hearing set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| just to clarify that for next Thursday and Friday, the 29th and 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| They will be here in the large assembly room beginning that morning, I think approximately 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| The public is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| While there's not a public participation piece as a part of the legislative hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| we'll have that at 5 o'clock there on the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| but I do invite you to come by and sit and listen to your elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| talk with the administration about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Councilman Hookless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1412)|

| 0:23:41| there will be a trail building school at William Hastie Natural Area in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| And I don't remember the names of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| It's a husband and wife team that travel the country doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| mountain bikers, building, teaching people how to build mountain bike trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| And they will be doing this school, teaching people hands-on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| They'll actually be building trails in the city's park, the William Hastie Natural Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| from 9 until I believe about noon or a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| But they'll be meeting at Lake Forest Presbyterian Church and going from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1459)|

| 0:25:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Yeah, I know we talked a fair amount about this at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| This feels like very much an extension of industrial into a residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| and I think this is a bad mistake to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| It's a long way between this property and the next nearest industrial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| and it's a residential zone, and I think this council is better than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| So I'm going to be voting against this, and I would urge everybody to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| I may be wrong in this, but I think there's a piece of property right beside it that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Yes, but other than that, there's no property anywhere near it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| And, I mean, it was a spot zoning years ago, and Mom always – I'm talking out of turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| I'm sorry, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1595)|

| 0:27:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Briefly, Friday after work I went out and met on site with Mr. Ballinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| I certainly can understand the unfortunate situation they were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| I feel it was an honest measuring mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| They're building what is going to be a real nice house and their garage is encroaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1693)|
| 0:28:21| on the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| The lot is definitely a challenging lot and we talked about how fill in the past had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| used to be placed on that lot and they had to find a place on the lot where they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| get the compaction, they could get the foundation put in, and they could avoid a KUB easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| and this allows them to do it and, you know, just like I said, unfortunately their garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| has gone astray a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| Their garage has gone astray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Ms. Peeble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| We could have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| That worries you that garages can do that, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Well, I have to concur with Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| I sat through this hearing with EZA and at the time felt that it was just an unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| situation that he finds himself in and I'm going to support this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Well, I guess, you know, I may be the oddball again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| I was surprised there, but part of the problem as I understand it is this happened because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| this guy started building a house before he got a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| And that's a problem when people do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| And it's part of why BZA denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| And I think the unfortunate part is this is a builder who started before he got a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| permit and then measured wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| And maybe they were both honest mistakes, but they were both mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| And I think if we approve this appeal, we're saying, oh, well, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| You really didn't mean it when somebody did something significantly wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| And I kind of have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| I don't see the option of saying, well, the house has to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| But it feels like saying, you know, all is forgiven is not the way to go on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| It's an unfortunate problem, but it's still a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| And I don't want to encourage people to build buildings without building permits in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Maybe I should have further prefaced my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Mr. Ballinger and I have talked about and he's welcome to explain the situation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| what seemed to be a very reasonable, logical explanation of how someone got to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| because of time freed up and were able to get started early and ended up not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| But before we go to him, Mr. Hook, let's just lay out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Would you like to go first or hear from him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Sir, if you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| I'm Mike Ballinger, 4308 Royal View Road, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| The explanation on the building permit is the basement is a modular wall system designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| to be set in a few hours with a crane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| They called and they had an opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| It was going to be about another month before they could get back out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| So I intended to go that day to get the permit and got busy and did not make it down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| and started down there the following day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| And the inspector called and they'd been by and said, we need to talk about this, went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| So they called us and let me finish for that day and then we got all the approvals in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| going forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Now, Mr. Hucklestein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Well, the other thing that I noticed that Charlotte Davis, I believe, from Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1882)|
| 0:31:31| City Town Hall was in opposition, I believe, representing Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| And I don't see her here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| I don't know if anyone's here representing Town Hall or anyone's here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| I was just curious about that, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Mr. Frost, have you talked with the folks from Town Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Last Thursday we had the meeting concerning the proposed cell phone tower and this topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| came up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| You know, they, the way it was characterized to me was they didn't really want to oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| it, but that they, you know, they didn't want this to go, people started thinking this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| precedent setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| So they, you know, they almost hated to show up at MPC, but they, you know, didn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| that to get used against them in the future, I think, would be a fair way to characterize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| And they're, you know, they're not pushing to kill it or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| Well, could I just comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Well, let me go to Mr. Becker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Mr. Becker, she said, go ahead, Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Well, no, I was just going to comment and, of course, you were there also, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| But I think at that, at the VZA meeting, Charlotte did comment, you know, this is not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| we really don't want the house torn down, but that she was very concerned about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| fact that it would be a precedent setting situation, which Mr. Becker spoke well to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| And it's a very difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| And normally, I would just be pretty hard-nosed about this, but this seems like a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| where it's very unfortunate for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| So that's why I decided to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Yeah, I guess the other concern I've got is I understand the getting the foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| in and you were a day late on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| And, you know, that one, I don't think you should be, you know, is not much of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| The other thing I see here from a list, I got this from Ms. Cash, about the timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| that on 10-23, you were working without the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| You got a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| I guess you submitted that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| So that was all dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| But on that day, you were cautioned that you had problems with your setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| And then, you know, you got your building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| You resumed construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| My concern is that you were told, while it was still basically a hole in the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| that there were problems with your setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| And then we've got a whole house to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| And just want to know sort of what happened in that interim of why, when you were told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| you had problems with your setbacks, you didn't deal with it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Mr. Lowe called me, the inspector, and suggested I measure that he'd gotten a call from someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| So I did measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| The original survey layout that I have shows pavement, and then it says 25-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| So I went out and measured from the curb, thinking that's where my 25 feet was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| Called him back and told him that I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| He said, good, you've measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| It was probably a few weeks later he called and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| I've gotten another call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| You need to go measure again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Is this your first house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| No, we've built other houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| One in Anderson County and a couple in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Me and my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Have you ever built in the city before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| No, my father's built in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Okay, ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| I should have said before you vote, hopefully, everybody read in their packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| we'd forgotten to say that that was in consideration with 11K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| so I don't think that's going to change anybody's vote, but apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| Moved to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| Moved to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| 10B, an appeal by Michael Jordan of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| to deny the request for variance to allow vehicular access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| to a self-storage facility by a local school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| Vehicular access to a self-storage facility by a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| Knoxville City Code Appendix B, Article 5, Section 3F7A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| has per site plan to construct a self-storage facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| in a C6 General Commercial Park District property located at 2750 Luz Creek Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| BZA denied 3-0 to be considered with 11L, a resolution approving the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2139)|
| 0:35:50| Mr. Frost, I see the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| I'm not sure here to speak, but I've conversed with Mr. Swanson and Mrs. Poplin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| about the situation, and it appears that this isn't even something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| that council can consider based on the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Do you care to elaborate, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| Only to the extent that I would concur with the findings of the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| that what they are requesting a variance for is not a variable issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2174)|
| 0:36:22| Yes, there are two variances they ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| One is not variable, and one is, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| So the 25-foot setback we could consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| That's variable, but the other is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| The access issue is not a variable issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| And the only way to address the non-variable issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| is to rewrite part of the zoning order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Well, or change the designation of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| Ms. Poplin, do you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| The code requires that access for self-storage facilities be via a collector street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| and their variance is requesting access through a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| That's not a dimensional and area variation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| that the Board of Zoning Appeals had authority to grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| So that's a legislative function that would require an actual zoning amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| to provide access through a collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| is it the code requires a collector and this is a local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| or does the code require a major collector and this is a minor collector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| The actual request says it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I was thinking it was a major-minor collector, but you could be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| You're the expert, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Well, their request is for local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| and the code requires collector, whether it's major or minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| Local. You're right. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Mr. Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| So they were approved for the setback, but not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| They were denied for the access question, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| They denied it. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| I thought the BCA denied both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| That's not reflected here, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Not on the face of this, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Under the background, the Board of Zoning Appeals denied both variances requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| Mr. Swanson, what, if anything, can the Council do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| I guess the question is, can we bifurcate the variance request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| and deal with the one that is proper before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Yes, I think that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| I think that you can deal with the setback issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| but I do not believe that you have authority to deal with the access issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| Mr. Holquist, is that a lighter? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Would you... I see you standing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Would you all... Anything you'd like to say to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Michael Jordan. I'm with Byrd and Cooper Architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| at 5421 Fountain Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| We applied for two variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| Both were denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| The variance for the setback change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| was denied because BCA said it does not constitute a hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| and we have decided to just drop that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| The variance that we're going for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| is for access to our site from a local street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| as opposed to a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| And that's what everyone is telling us is non-variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| I think that sounds like a consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| both from Council's attorney as well as the City Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| And that means...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| Council is unable to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| That would be my opinion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Council doesn't have the authority to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| to grant a variance that is being requested at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| if they've dropped the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| So there's no reason for a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| There's no reason for a motion. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| Okay, right now that's going to die for lack of a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| unless I see something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Mr. Jordan, do you want to say something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| Well, I notice we're on the agenda here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| for resolutions continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| Does that mean this is impossible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| to get this access to our site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| It doesn't mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| It means you have to go back and do a zoning code amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| What does that entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Or have a different proposed use for the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| File an application with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| Can I say a couple of things on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| We applied for rezoning from a C3 to a C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| based on MPC's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| for this particular facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| It's a prime area for a self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| There's very limited traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| People I've spoken with at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| have all agreed that this is a great use for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| And it has been done in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| where a self-storage facility has been granted access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| from a minor collector or a local street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| which actually abuts a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| I don't know exactly the circumstances for its approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| but it was allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| I simply can't advise Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| I don't know whether that's true or whether that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| I certainly accept your word that it is true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| and I advise Council that they can do something illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| because something illegal happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| Well, I don't think it was an illegal or illegal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| It was allowed by...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| I forget exactly what arm of government allowed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| but it went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| I could get more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Would you like to say something, Ray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| This is a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| I'm Ray Pinkstaff, the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| and this is a project that we've been working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| that we think is an excellent use for the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| The piece of property is bounded by a railroad track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| on the north side, the mall on the east and west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| and the Food City grocery store right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| And the property now is used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| as kind of a party site on the weekends for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| There's dumping of mattresses and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| This would clean the property up, put it on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| We've had all our approvals from most everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| and I guess what we're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| is the solution to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| We do know it was done in 2005 for the Cheshire property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| off of Cheshire Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| And I guess, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| if this is not proper for council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| what steps do we need to take now to maybe go forward with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Put this property back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| Seeking an amendment to the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| that would allow access from the type of street that is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| which currently the code does not permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| If I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| Let me... I will come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Mr. Hoekstra, are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| What I would actually do, not to disagree with Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| is I talk about how streets get designated certain ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| and find out how that decision is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| I mean, this is part of Love's Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| which I'm sure is a collector very nearby this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Yes, sir. Right on the other side it is a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| It's 700 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| I don't want to actually ask a question about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| but it might be worth you asking to find out how that process happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| because I don't know that we would want to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| that particular part of the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| that Mr. Swanson is suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| I'm not suggesting that you change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| He asked for how it could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| In following up that comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| what I was wanting to say anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| is I think it would be risky to assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| that the zoning code would change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| in a particular application or need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| because there's a reason for that in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| Personally, as a council member, I'd be very cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| about changing the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| Mr. Becker's got a point there may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| and I don't know if this is a reality or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| and Mr. King may or may not be able to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| or Mr. Donaldson, maybe more appropriately Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| I don't know who takes the lead on designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| or redesignation of the street might be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| I don't know. Mr. Wooten, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| The Metropolitan Planning Commission is charged with the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| of adopting and approving a Knox County major thoroughfare plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| which does in fact designate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| the various classifications to the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Loves Creek south of Millartown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| and the intersection with Rutledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| is classified as a major collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| and the area north had been at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| until it was disconnected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| from I believe Mill Street or Mildred Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| So we could consider amending the thoroughfare plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Obviously, you know, it's a rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| It's too bad it had to get to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| before these folks had to spend their time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| I know Mr. Pinkstaff had called me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| and I called him back saying I was real busy at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| and in the meantime I talked to Mrs. Boplin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| and Mr. Swanson in emails and found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| that there was nothing that council can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| I just regret that it's taken this long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| to make that final determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Well you know it was mentioned about the Cheshire Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| storage units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| and sitting here I can think of two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| that are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| in the same type of area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| and it is a shame to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| that some of these developments can get approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| and just slip through with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| consideration and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| something like this reaches this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| because the fairness aspect of it really troubles me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| and as you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| the Cheshire Drive is a heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| well it's heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| what do I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| it's heavily residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| it's actually multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| it puzzles me and we just recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| two recently approved one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| at the entrance to Crestwood Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| so that is quite in my memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| and I really don't know how we get to these situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| which don't seem to me to be equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| and I understand Mr. Swanson's ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| and all the comments tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| but on the other hand I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| I feel that these folks here probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| anticipated the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| ability to move this through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| so we have problems somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| Right now we're going to move on for lack of a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| because I have no other choice of anything to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| An appeal by T. Scott Jones, Ed Navarro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| to deny the rezoning of property located on the southeast side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| of East Magnolia Avenue southwest of Spruce Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| from C3 General Commercial District to C4 Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| and Arterial Commercial District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| NPC denied 9-4 to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| with 12-D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| which is a resolution to approve the rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| There is no motions on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| but there is someone to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| I think Mr. Jones is here to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Mr. Jones, if you'd like to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| T. Scott Jones, Law Practice 318 North K Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| This is a business that I own with Mr. Navarro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| Many of you may know it as Hubert's Car Wash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| We bought it about three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| It's been around for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| The city, the county, the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| and most of the government contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| One of the things we've done to try to expand the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| and offer basically more job opportunities to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| was utilizing a rental truck business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| U-Haul-like, it's not U-Haul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| It was budget trucks, trailers and things of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| It was brought to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| We needed to come in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| The next day after Ms. Cash brought it to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| I went down and we filed to move from C3 to C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| I have no intention of operating a car lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| but C4 is the only one that has the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| or had that for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| What we had proposed on our appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| was that we continue to enjoy the benefits of the C3 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| with everything excised out of C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| We also talked about the ability to rent trucks and trailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| I think we've discussed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| I sent out a package and I hope everybody got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| with some photographs of our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| and what we've got going on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| If anybody has any questions, I'd be glad to answer those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| but we would certainly like to have that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| It is certainly something that will help our business remain viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| and hopefully remain a part of the community out in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| I've had several conversations with Mr. Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| and also with our counsel Mr. Swanson regarding this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| He just spoke to one of the ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| in talking with him and Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| that I think we can make this a doable situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| and that's with regards to limiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| He has agreed to limit himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| to all the C3 rights that he has currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| but also to just being able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| the truck sale rental and the trailer rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| not any car rentals or anything of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Additionally, Mr. Jones and I talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| the future of Magnolia Avenue with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| the potential of form-based code coming on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| possibly in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| We have a Magnolia Avenue corridor study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| and I was speaking to him with regards to the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| of one of the concerns that I heard was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| of putting up fencing in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| which may be in conflict with that particular situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| He and I have discussed that and he has agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| that form-based code does come on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| and one of the things that happens with regards to the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| and everything being flush and setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| that if he is in a position to try to put up some sort of fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| that he would comply with any appropriate setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| to put it back flush with the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| That's correct. We have no problem in doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| complying with anything with regards to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| It was something that the business has been there 42 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| and never been fenced. There is a fence along the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| that was with it when we got the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Linden Avenue is the road back behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| and then there is an alleyway behind those houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| and then it steps down. It's about an 8 to 10 foot drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| There is a difference in elevation between the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| There is a center block wall that goes along the entire back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| and then there is a fence up above that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| and that was there when we got the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| As far as any fencing, we don't have any intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| unless we are requested to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| we will do whatever we are requested to come in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| I know there is another light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| I am going to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| that in order to get to where we need to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| to where I would like to get with this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| I will have to make a motion first to approve the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| and hopefully get a second to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| then I am going to do an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| so we get in the record what we are trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| The other thing I spoke to Mr. Jones about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| is a concern of this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| is when we have C4 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| which in the future someone could come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| As a matter of fact, I had my car washed there a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| prior to knowing this was coming along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| and they are doing a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| and he has beautified the area that is working with the school kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| and the schools are helping to raise money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| I think he is being a good responsible businessman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| and I want to make sure we do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| and I am glad he has agreed to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| I will make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Then I am going to make an amendment to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| I guess I have a quick procedural question for Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| This is an appeal of a zoning thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| so if we approve the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| that sort of becomes in effect a passage on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| so it still would come back in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| because this is a zoning change, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| It is a zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| So there would be a second reading on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| I agree with Mr. Brown's thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| about agreeing to do what the new Magnolia code is going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| I want to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| the folks up in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| Comprehensive Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Mike Carberry and Mike Reynolds are working on the Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| the new zone for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| I wanted to ask you to get one of those out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| and meet with them on site in the next two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| to have some concrete sense about what they are going to be talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| what they suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| to make sure we are on the same page about what we are agreeing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| I think this is a good solution and it is going to work well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| I want to get a little more concreteness in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| if that fits with Mr. Brown's thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| I am sure Mr. Jones would be willing to meet with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| Tell me who exactly I am supposed to meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Mr. Donaldson is right there on the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| Who you need to speak to are the individuals and the phone numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3298)|
| 0:55:06| If this is a way of getting us there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| where we are trying to head anyway with the form based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| I think I am okay with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| but I want to point out that there is no C4 anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| anywhere around that on Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| the only other zoning that is anywhere in that general vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| along Magnolia is 01| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| There is no C4 now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| so without this being heavily conditioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| to actually make it reflect where we are trying to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| with the form based code, I would not support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| but I want to see us get there with the form based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| so if that is where we are headed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| and the conditions are reflective of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| then when it comes to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| this is an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| It is an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| You grant the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| then you approve the ordinance on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| I am okay with the condition on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| Seeing no other lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| I move to amend the ordinance granting the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3369)|

| 1:03:24| This is a very tangential item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| I think this is fine. The contract makes sense. I'm always a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| worried about the public perception of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| through KCDC processes to do things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| brings for some people a certain connotation. I think it makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| sense in this case, but I just want to say publicly we should try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| and limit doing that when it's possible. That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Thank you. I just wanted to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Mr. Hill is not here because he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3828)|

| 1:04:03| questions? I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3843)|

| 1:04:12| and I think they'll do fine on this. This is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| parks. Waterfront parks is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| their strength. I mean, their landscape architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| do a great job on everything waterfront related overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| but this is where they really shine, so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| they'll do well. Thank you. Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3867)|

| 1:05:58| Vice Mayor Brown. I was just going to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| one of the things we hear about no matter where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| live geographically is that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| educators are underpaid sometimes and even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| underappreciated and it also holds true of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| folk who in this situation prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| to 1987, you know, worked for our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| and I think this is a way to put an equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| balance in this process. My understanding is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| Pension Board has talked about this. I see Mr. Gilbert in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| who's ready to address it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| the Pension Board has recommended it. I do want to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| I made the motion. I'm in favor of it and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| just sitting here thinking and it may actually affect my mother-in-law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| because she's been working at the city for a long time and still is working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| so if she ever retires, you know, it might affect her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| but I want to just put that out there as a public disclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| but I think it is high time that we balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| this situation so that those pensions of those folk who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| worked a long time ago, they make even the kind of money that folk are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| today or making today kind of get bought on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| even keel here and I think it's what we need to do. We must also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| always take care of, you know, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| as I've said before, our unsung heroes and educators fall right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| in that definition. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| I'd like to hear from Mr. Gilbert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| or someone on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| because it was originally the Pension Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| when this first came up in 2000 did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| think it was a good idea and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| they think it is and I'd like to get an idea of what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| changed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| My name is Bud Gilbert. I'm with Kennerly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| Montgomery and Finley were General Counsel of the City of Knoxville Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| Councilman, in 2000 the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Pension Board did not think it was a good idea that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| sunset this provision so when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| was voted on in 2006 the Pension Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| actually recommended that the sunset provision be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| As you may recall, the voters chose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| not in their wisdom to approve that amendment in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| so the issue is up before you again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| in 2008. The Pension Board did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| actually recommend it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| Some of the Pension Board members sit with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| They could probably speak more eloquently to that. I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| probably in deference to the voters but that does not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| mean that the Pension Board's reasoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| two years ago has changed. We felt it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| poor plan designed to have any pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| benefit sunset. That creates an equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| issue with other pensioners and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| why they chose not to recommend it this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| I think was probably just out of deference to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| A quick I guess question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| Mr. Gilbert and then for actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| anybody who knows the second one. This has got an annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| cost of $163,000, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| That is according to the actuary's report in May of this year, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| And I guess I just have a question about what ends up on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| you know in reading what's in here that number is not on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| and does anybody know does that number my recollection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| is these numbers end up on the ballot and is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| everybody else's sense as well? Yes that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| and our charter is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| Thank you. Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| There's really no cost to the taxpayer, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| Well no there is. In a roundabout way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| but isn't it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| Well there could be because currently the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| section is overfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| and this according to the actuary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| would cause that system to be underfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| which would cause an annual cost of the number that was quoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| and that would have to be made up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| by the city of Knoxville in its annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| I mean the actuary tells us that this is the real number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| that will cost that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| $163,000. Now as you may know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| from year to year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| investment performance can change the size of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| assets can go up and so that number can change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| if we have a wonderful investment year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| it may not be, I mean the number is relatively small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| so therefore it can be highly profitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| depending on the performance of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| We've had a great year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| in the last actuarial year that closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| in June 30, 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| but this year the performance hasn't been as good. The year is not over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| So we just have to look at that each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| according to the actuarial study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| Thank you. Councilman Becker again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| Quick question on that. Was the study done at a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| where the situation was good or bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| and does that, I'm not an expert on this, does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| make a difference? Was it done at a point where this is sort of the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| number it's going to be because the market was bad or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| a gut sense on that? My guess would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| that the actuary would have based his numbers on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| June 30, 2007 actuarial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| report which was a relatively good report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| because of the good year that had just concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| The numbers that we talked about even at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| mid-year budget in terms of the pension costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| probably have been, have inched up a little since then because of that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| but to Bud's point, if you take a, this is the one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| you need to have a video of, not a snapshot because any snapshot is going to be a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| Anything else? Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| I'm a little sideways here on this one because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| the way it was presented to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| and I didn't do all my homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| it's not the same way I'm hearing it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| and I'd really like to have a little bit of time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| go back and talk through this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| This is first reading. I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| I don't like to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| that path normally but anyway, I guess I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| I'll just go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| and vote on it tonight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| in the next two weeks I can do my homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Okay, thank you. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Okay, all those in favor, aye. Aye. Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Okay, motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| 12B, an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| Chapter 5, Article 6, concerning dangerous dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| I thought that was going to get put down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| It's not the ordinance that you want to see before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| is it, Councilman? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| 12C, an ordinance to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| and adopt the 2009-2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| Knoxville Capital Improvements Program and Budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| Move approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| Mr. Becker. Just a quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| I mentioned this to Deputy Mayor Martin and I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| I'd like to get a little time at the budget hearings to talk a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| about this. I think this is probably a good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| We're finally, the first year we did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| the numbers for the current year were not the same as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| as the budget we had and we've got that worked out. But to think a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| about what is our plan for the next year, it's interesting to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| that the plan actually has a significant increase in our capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| budget next year and I'd love to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| that that's true rather than just sort of a nice idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| But to take a little more time at the budget hearings to talk about those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| and I want to get that out to everybody now. I think that's probably fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| I think it's probably safe to say that we do a lot more work on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| near-term capital budgets than we do in the outgoing ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| and they're probably subject to a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| what's the word I'm looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Being skeptical of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Skepticism, there's a word I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| Yes, sir. Right now, this is exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| I don't know if people noticed this, but you all know Dennis Hancock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| You've all been to his house. My understanding is that we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| have down to fix that problem in 2012 right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| which is kind of exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| Only nine years after he raised it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| we actually have it on the plan to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| We're waiting until you're out of that district. I know, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| It didn't work out that way. Can't have any credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| We appreciate that too, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| That was teasing about that. Okay, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| All those in favor, aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4474)|
| 1:14:45| 12F, an emergency ordinance of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| appropriating the sum of $250 from the Community Improvement Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| and donating SANG to the Emerald Youth Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| to be utilized for general program support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| Questions here? I would note that I'm on that board, but I'm not voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| Well, I would note that that is one of the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| wonderful experiences that one can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| in a year. We have eight people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| If we go four-four, then you'd have to vote. Then I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| Okay. All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| There being no one signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080520?start=4521)|
