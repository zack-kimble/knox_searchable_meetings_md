| 2:34:37| and 170 new jobs here to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9277)|
| 2:34:40| And it was really great to see Mayor O'Hara out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| as a part of that announcement with the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| with Commissioner Randy Boyd, and with the other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| from TVA and the state and the national lab, all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| really working together for a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9291)|
| 2:34:56| I had not planned to do this, but it's very timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| This email came through the office this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| And we currently have about 57 projects in our pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9302)|
| 2:35:07| that we are working and chasing and trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| to make something happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9309)|
| 2:35:12| A little more than 72% of those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9312)|
| 2:35:16| are manufacturing, which is an increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| as we have continued to see increase in manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| Then you have a breakdown with the rest of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| in distribution and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| And the majority of those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| are still near recruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| So we continue to see great activity at our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9331)|
| 2:35:34| and we will continue, as Doug Lawyer and I work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| to market that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| But this is just a highlight of some of the activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| that we have had going on this week, if you'll allow me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:46| We have a major manufacturing site visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| which required coordination of various schedules of partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| in the region, including helicopters, security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9351)|
| 2:35:54| clearance, collaboration with regional partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| and presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9356)|
| 2:35:57| We've also had folks in for our competitive airfare partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9357)|
| 2:36:02| and looking at a low-cost airfare carrier, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| are still here, have had a number of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9365)|
| 2:36:08| with those folks this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9368)|
| 2:36:09| We have another major site visit by a manufacturing prospect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| this afternoon, another project who is verified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| they are coming in on June 8th, a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| that we thought was dead, which happens from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9378)|
| 2:36:22| has arisen and is back in the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9382)|
| 2:36:26| We've had an offer on a piece of property on a 525-job project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| that we've been working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| We did an existing industry with one of our headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| here in Knoxville that's a great corporate citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| and continue to work with them growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| We've got more than 20-plus teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9398)|
| 2:36:41| signed up for the Educators in the Workplace program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| That is, our teachers go into different businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| throughout the summer to learn what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9407)|
| 2:36:48| skills are going to be needed for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| as they come out into the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9410)|
| 2:36:53| Our Mentor-Protege program is about to launch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9413)|
| 2:36:57| its third class of 15 different Mentor-Protege pairings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| This will be a total of 45 companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| that we have going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| And we continue to see activity going along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| We have, I think you guys would be pleased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| you have a great team of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| in economic development working for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| And we have a great product here to work with in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9437)|
| 2:37:21| And we're going to continue to see what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| can do to make success happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| I'd be happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| Just curious, you probably can't say without killing us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| but are you seeing any, what, growth or potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9452)|
| 2:37:37| to get auto parts folks moving to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9457)|
| 2:37:41| as part of a regional supply team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9461)|
| 2:37:44| Oh, thank you for asking, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9464)|
| 2:37:49| You'll notice on the stakeholders update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| that Krusty is passing out, one company in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9473)|
| 2:37:56| that located in the city of Knoxville is Hicks Plastics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| Hicks is an automotive supplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| They were here with Doug, the lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| They were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9483)|
| 2:38:03| And so that's a good example of automotive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9483)|
| 2:38:06| We do continue to see tier two automotive suppliers looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| at this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| It's probably one of the most popular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| popular's not the right word, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| one of the business sectors that we see a lot of activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| in for manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9500)|
| 2:38:21| And the other question was, do you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9501)|
| 2:38:25| see a potential with 3D manufacturing moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9505)|
| 2:38:29| building things back to obviously this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| but also this region in terms of maybe cutting costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| and design work and development work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| so that we're competitive with shipping everything overseas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| and we can start doing it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| I think what you're saying is we see a lot of activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| in advanced manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| And what you'll see is that the quality of the products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9529)|
| 2:38:53| that companies are getting is a much better quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| And very competitive because their suppliers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| they want the quality, not sloppy work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| And so having the lab, having the manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9541)|
| 2:39:04| demonstration facility here is a huge asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9544)|
| 2:39:06| for helping us recruit those types of companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| I'll just ask one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9551)|
| 2:39:12| Is there one thing or is there one thing or two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9552)|
| 2:39:15| that we can do that we should be on the alert for that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9555)|
| 2:39:20| is a reoccurring reason why someone doesn't relocate here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9560)|
| 2:39:25| Is there a reoccurring reason why someone might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| come to Knoxville that we might be able to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9567)|
| 2:39:30| or should be addressing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| You have a couple of things probably, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| We have to have product, as we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| And we live in a beautiful part of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| but it's not exactly flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| And so there are certain types of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9582)|
| 2:39:43| that are just not going to be suitable anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| in East Tennessee or anywhere that has that type of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| So we have to make hay with what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| And we have to be creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| We have to be aggressive and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| to really take advantage of the resources that we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| and really work hard to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9598)|
| 2:40:02| For some of the larger projects, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| mentioned the competitive airfare program, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9604)|
| 2:40:07| the city is very supportive of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| Airfare and cost of that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| that does impact businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| And we hear it, not from just new recruits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| but from our existing industries as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| So we're going to continue to work with the airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| authority and folks here in our region in working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| I think we're making some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9625)|
| 2:40:29| Councilman Stegert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9629)|
| 2:40:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9630)|
| 2:40:31| That's what I was going to ask, is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| a report on the low fare air carrier project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| and how that's going and what you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| may happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| As I mentioned, Councilman, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| had the consultants and the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| in that we're working with in this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| They did meet with Mayor Rojero and give an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9646)|
| 2:40:49| What we're working on is really, it's not just a pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9649)|
| 2:40:54| You have to show the business value for what an air carrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| would want to be in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| We think we've got some great opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| but we also think we have some work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| So there's going to be some continuing effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9664)|
| 2:41:06| over the next several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9666)|
| 2:41:07| And I think you'll see more and more details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| as that comes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9669)|
| 2:41:13| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:14| I don't see any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9676)|
| 2:41:21| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9681)|
| 2:41:24| This will be a barn burner, won't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9684)|
| 2:41:30| Councilman Wallace is anticipating a barn burner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| It's going to be a barn burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| My name is Charles Swanson, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| proud to represent the law department, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| the Office of Risk Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| If you look at the budget, our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| stayed pretty much what it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9705)|
| 2:41:48| We're going to continue with the same number of lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| that we've had for the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| And so there's not a lot exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| to talk about in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9715)|
| 2:41:56| So I would like to take a couple of minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| if you're willing to let me, to talk about a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| that we do in the law department that you don't see very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| much of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| And as our board of directors, you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| ought to know about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| You just heard from the Office of Redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9730)|
| 2:42:13| about all the wonderful things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| are going on in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| in terms of redevelopment in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9737)|
| 2:42:22| You know and I know when we go downtown now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| as opposed to when we used to go downtown 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| it's just a different place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9748)|
| 2:42:29| And it's different because so many things are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9749)|
| 2:42:32| So many projects are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| Well, we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| We're excited about the projects that are going on in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9757)|
| 2:42:41| We're excited about what's going on in Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| We're excited about the Marble City development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| We're excited about the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| are going on in the old city and out on Sixth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| And all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| But let me tell you, those things don't just happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9773)|
| 2:42:56| And you don't realize, I think, to a certain extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9776)|
| 2:43:00| how much the law department gets involved in those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| Because every one of those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| typically starts off with we hire some experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9786)|
| 2:43:10| to look at our situation and decide or help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9790)|
| 2:43:13| us decide where is the best place to spend our resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| how to make it work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| So we hire experts to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| You do it with a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9802)|
| 2:43:23| And primarily it's Lisa Hatfield in our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9803)|
| 2:43:26| who will put together that contract for those experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| to come in and consult with us and give us some ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| about how to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| And then they come in and they give us the ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| And you all look at those ideas and you kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| decide which way you want to go forward with those ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| along with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| And then we have to hire another group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9823)|
| 2:43:47| to come in and design a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| And that happens with a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| And typically Lisa Hatfield prepares that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9833)|
| 2:43:58| And it's not always a very simple contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| And so that's got to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| Meantime, while you're designing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| if you're going forward with this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| you've got to acquire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| You've got to acquire construction easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| You've got to acquire drainage easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9850)|
| 2:44:13| You've got to acquire a whole lot of property interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9853)|
| 2:44:16| And Lisa Hatfield does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9856)|
| 2:44:20| She prepares the design contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| She prepares the easement documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| And she helps them to negotiate those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| And she works with the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| in a great way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| And let me tell you, working with the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| department, we have a fabulous engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| that does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| But as a lawyer working with engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| you know that for engineers, everything's black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| There's always a yes or no answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| to every question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| For engineers, that's just how they're built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| And so sometimes when we have businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| who want us to work with them in a little ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| sometimes the initial reaction from the engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| is this is a black and white issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| And the answer is no, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9898)|
| 2:45:01| We have found that Lisa is very adept at trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9901)|
| 2:45:06| to work out solutions so that the answer is yes instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9906)|
| 2:45:09| of no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9909)|
| 2:45:09| We try to make the answer yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| Sometimes the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| That's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| Sometimes there are federal regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9914)|
| 2:45:16| Sometimes there are reasons why we have to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9916)|
| 2:45:19| But we try to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| We try to work with developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| We try to work with contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| And Lisa has, I think, a special skill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| at being able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| So then after you do that, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9931)|
| 2:45:34| got to build the project itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9934)|
| 2:45:35| So you've got to have a construction contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| And in the construction contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9937)|
| 2:45:40| that's a really complicated contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9940)|
| 2:45:42| A lot of times, and more often than not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| either Lisa Hatfield or Allison Ebertine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9945)|
| 2:45:48| will be working on that construction contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| So you all don't really see those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| except when they come to you for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| And it tends to be not a very in-depth thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| But you don't really realize how much the law is involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9959)|
| 2:46:05| and how much the law department is involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| in making these things happen that happen on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| And we're really proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| And we're really proud of the effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| that our lawyers, Lisa, Allison, all of our lawyers up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9973)|
| 2:46:16| put into these types of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| So that's one thing that you don't see very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9979)|
| 2:46:22| Another thing that you may not think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9982)|
| 2:46:26| Gary Easties comes to me from risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9986)|
| 2:46:29| And we've got about 1,000, 1,500 vehicles or so out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9989)|
| 2:46:36| running up and down the streets all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| every day, doing work that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| But in the course of things, those vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| are going to be involved in collisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10004)|
| 2:46:47| That's just the way the world works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| And frankly, and gratefully, most of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| it's not our fault when we have collisions with our vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| And what has been happening in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10018)|
| 2:46:59| and Gary has pointed out to me, Gary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| does a great job with our safety for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10022)|
| 2:47:06| and with managing our insurance and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| He's, first and foremost, safety conscious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10030)|
| 2:47:14| And we have done a great job in reducing workers' comp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| and all those kinds of things because of the emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| that we have on safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| But he's also concerned about saving us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10042)|
| 2:47:25| And what has been happening in the past, to a certain extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10045)|
| 2:47:29| is we get in a wreck and we have damage to our vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| not our fault. We typically send our vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| to fleet management if we can, and fleet management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10056)|
| 2:47:38| fixes it up and gets it back out on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10058)|
| 2:47:40| because that's how we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| But we ought to get paid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10062)|
| 2:47:43| We ought to be compensated by whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| it was who caused the wreck in a subrogation suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10065)|
| 2:47:49| And typically, what has sort of happened in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| is we'll file a claim against whoever it was that is at fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10072)|
| 2:47:57| and they'll just kind of ignore us and it kind of goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| We have not emphasized that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| And with Gary's help, we are now emphasizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| those subrogation cases, and we are pursuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| those subrogation cases a little more vigorously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| I think, than we ever have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| And it's showing results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| For example, in the last year, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10097)|
| 2:48:18| have recovered right at $20,000 or over $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10098)|
| 2:48:22| in subrogation expenses owed to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10102)|
| 2:48:26| And that's money that we weren't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| recovering before, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| And that's just the start because, as you all well know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| the law is not necessarily the fastest operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10114)|
| 2:48:38| instrumentality in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10118)|
| 2:48:39| And so we've just got this program started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10119)|
| 2:48:42| and we anticipate that it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| to bring back great returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| And I hope you're going to put that in the law department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| budget in the following years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| So having done all that about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10130)|
| 2:48:53| that you don't see very much, are there questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10133)|
| 2:48:56| Mr. Delvopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| Just curious, there's been a lot of talk lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10141)|
| 2:49:04| in neighborhood meetings about corridor overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10144)|
| 2:49:08| especially on Washington Pike, but other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| And if my memory serves me correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| that was yanked because there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| concerns from the administration, maybe law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| as to how that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10157)|
| 2:49:18| And should the MPC director, for example, be the appeal body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10158)|
| 2:49:22| Is there any progress on corridor overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10162)|
| 2:49:24| Where are we going with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10164)|
| 2:49:26| We are very interested in corridor overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| And we have Krista Cuccaro, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10168)|
| 2:49:31| doing a lot of our land use things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| And you all have some experience with Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| She does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10175)|
| 2:49:38| They are doing the research and putting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10178)|
| 2:49:43| the ideas behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10183)|
| 2:49:44| And we came with a corridor overlay process early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10184)|
| 2:49:50| but we felt like there needed to be some refining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10190)|
| 2:49:54| and some revision of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| And we're about to get a new MPC director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10196)|
| 2:49:58| and we'd like to have the benefit of the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10198)|
| 2:50:01| of the new MPC director and that leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10201)|
| 2:50:05| And looking at that with us and coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| with the corridor overlay system that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| really going to work best for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| So no, we haven't forgotten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10212)|
| 2:50:13| Yes, we are working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10213)|
| 2:50:14| And it's going to be a little while before it comes to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| but I think it is coming to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10217)|
| 2:50:18| It is, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| I was just going to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10219)|
| 2:50:20| That's the first thing on my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10220)|
| 2:50:21| We've talked about it several times, of course, at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| I know Councilman Wallace is very interested as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10223)|
| 2:50:26| It's the first thing on my list to sit down and discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10226)|
| 2:50:28| with the MPC director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10228)|
| 2:50:30| Our law director, Mr. Swanson, is correct in that Krista| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| has developed a really good framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| for this kind of overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10235)|
| 2:50:40| but we did want to make some changes to that last draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10240)|
| 2:50:44| And so we'll work through those and get that before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10244)|
| 2:50:47| And there was some concerns, I remember originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| about is it going to displace things like the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10249)|
| 2:50:53| or something else with its own standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| And so we had to be sure that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| going to work well with the system we had in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10257)|
| 2:50:59| Well, keep in mind, it's just a framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| And so when it does get voted in for a certain location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10261)|
| 2:51:06| you can put whatever you want to in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10266)|
| 2:51:08| We're establishing the framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10268)|
| 2:51:09| and then each one of those corridor overlay districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| may have different dictates depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| on what's wanted by that particular group that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| votes it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10275)|
| 2:51:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10276)|
| 2:51:17| They're going to be kind of adapted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10277)|
| 2:51:18| to a particular site or area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10280)|
| 2:51:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10283)|
| 2:51:24| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| OK, for the fire department budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10288)|
| 2:51:31| is that where we're going next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10291)|
| 2:51:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10294)|
| 2:51:35| OK, it's pages 14 and 15 in the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| And then also in your capital printout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10298)|
| 2:51:41| if you'll turn to page 12, you'll have the history for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10301)|
| 2:51:44| Well, let me ask, Mr. Swanson, did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| want Gary to say anything, or just yours was encompassing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10306)|
| 2:51:55| I tried to say enough good things about Gary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10315)|
| 2:51:57| that he didn't feel the need to be immodest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| and come and talk to you himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10320)|
| 2:52:01| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| He was just on the agenda, just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| It's page 12 in the capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| In the capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10329)|
| 2:52:16| Chief, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10336)|
| 2:52:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10339)|
| 2:52:22| Vice Mayor Pavlis and members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10342)|
| 2:52:24| we want to thank you for this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| to talk about our budget for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10346)|
| 2:52:30| As leaders of this department, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| understand the need to be good stewards of our funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| and we're constantly assessing and reassessing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| But we still obviously look at providing the best service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| that we can to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10361)|
| 2:52:44| As you'll see, our proposed operating budget for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10364)|
| 2:52:47| is $43.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10367)|
| 2:52:50| That is an increase of $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| Most of that is, as you've probably already seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10373)|
| 2:52:57| is in salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| There's some increases in fleet charges, equipment replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10380)|
| 2:53:04| fund, and then KUB hydrant charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10384)|
| 2:53:08| Those make up the vast majority of the increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10388)|
| 2:53:11| And as usual, salaries and benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10391)|
| 2:53:14| account for 70% of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10394)|
| 2:53:16| All other expenses are equal the amount to the other 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10396)|
| 2:53:22| So in light of these anticipated increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| we didn't request other additional operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10405)|
| 2:53:27| funds for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| But I'll be glad to take any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| on those specific items if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10411)|
| 2:53:35| I do have, though, I'm not quite finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| I do have one of our capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10418)|
| 2:53:41| that's kind of a unique item that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10421)|
| 2:53:45| want to go over if you don't have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| about the operating part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10427)|
| 2:53:53| Just a quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10433)|
| 2:53:54| I had asked Jim York this, but maybe you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| can give me your view on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| There was a lot of overtime in the police and fire budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| And I don't know whether they are partly placeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10441)|
| 2:54:04| because overtime happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| You get a big fire and guys work 12, 15 hour shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| or whatever, or whether you expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| to actually spend that much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| I didn't know why it was all overtime as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| to straight time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10455)|
| 2:54:16| There are a lot of extra expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| The main portion of our overtime is in our firefighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10458)|
| 2:54:22| division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10462)|
| 2:54:23| We obviously have to staff a certain minimum number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| of people on the apparatus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10466)|
| 2:54:29| And a lot of that comes from our numbers right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10469)|
| 2:54:34| We're down several numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| We are normally we're at 327.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10476)|
| 2:54:40| The last count, we were at 306.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10480)|
| 2:54:44| So we're down in the firefighting division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| So because of that, yes, we are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10486)|
| 2:54:50| in the process of preparing for our next class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| It should start within the next month anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10493)|
| 2:54:57| And we're looking at 30 plus firefighters in that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10497)|
| 2:55:03| So once we get those numbers in, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10503)|
| 2:55:04| will make a huge difference in our firefighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| Now, that's the main portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10506)|
| 2:55:09| There are obviously, though, other costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| associated with unexpected fires where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10511)|
| 2:55:14| we have to deal with overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10514)|
| 2:55:18| Do you get any grant money to offset overtime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| Or is that mostly the police guys that have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| That's the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10522)|
| 2:55:23| They're the fortunate ones on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| I don't know of any grant money for overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| in the firefighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10528)|
| 2:55:29| Talk to our lobbyist, Tony Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10529)|
| 2:55:31| Yeah, that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10533)|
| 2:55:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10534)|
| 2:55:34| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10534)|
| 2:55:35| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| Christy mentioned this earlier, the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| of folks eligible for retirement in the coming whatever time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| period, relatively short time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10546)|
| 2:55:49| How do you all stack up in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| I can't give you those exact numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| but I'll give you some generalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| Starting in 1988, before that, the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10556)|
| 2:56:01| did not hire anyone for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10561)|
| 2:56:04| Starting in 88, we started having a class almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10564)|
| 2:56:07| every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| In the uniformed services, you can retire at age 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| with 25 years of service, as you're familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| So now we are starting to see some of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10575)|
| 2:56:20| get their 25 years in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| And we're seeing it's probably a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10582)|
| 2:56:25| than a trickle of them starting to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10585)|
| 2:56:29| We're probably going to have five or six per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10589)|
| 2:56:32| something like that would be my best guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10592)|
| 2:56:34| But each year, as they hit their 25th anniversary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10594)|
| 2:56:39| we're having some start to sign up on the drop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| Now, many of them will stay and put in their 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| but we are having some that are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| signing up after they're 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10606)|
| 2:56:50| So it's not a flood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10610)|
| 2:56:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10611)|
| 2:56:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| Further questions of the chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10615)|
| 2:56:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10619)|
| 2:56:59| You do want to talk about the capital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| There's one I really want to highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| If you'll, Chief Morris has a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10625)|
| 2:57:32| While he's handing those out to 30 guys in the class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10652)|
| 2:57:34| do you get 30 trainees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10654)|
| 2:57:37| I mean, at the end of the tunnel, or you'll get 20 or 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10657)|
| 2:57:40| No, we don't have a really high fail out rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10660)|
| 2:57:45| There's usually one or two that don't make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| through the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10668)|
| 2:57:49| And actually, we're above 30 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10669)|
| 2:57:52| Actually, we're up to 38 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10672)|
| 2:57:54| So we're not quite there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| But we're going to have to wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10676)|
| 2:57:57| We're going to have to wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| We're going to have to wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10679)|
| 2:58:00| Actually, we're up to 38 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| You might graduate 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10684)|
| 2:58:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| This capital request is about the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10688)|
| 2:58:12| of mechanical CPR devices, or mechanical chest compression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10692)|
| 2:58:16| devices, I guess, to be more accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10696)|
| 2:58:20| The American Heart Association emphasizes really high quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10700)|
| 2:58:24| chest compressions for a better chance of survival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| after cardiac arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10706)|
| 2:58:29| These type of devices that you see there in that brochure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| provide those high quality chest compressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10711)|
| 2:58:35| Basically, what they do is they provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| consistent, accurate compressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10716)|
| 2:58:40| They give compressions at the right depth, at the right rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10720)|
| 2:58:44| They don't get tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| They free up a person to do other duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10726)|
| 2:58:51| Some other advantages, they also can, one thing we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| is back injuries, sometimes back strains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10734)|
| 2:58:57| and things like that, from doing chest compressions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| over a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10739)|
| 2:59:00| So this can help in injury prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10740)|
| 2:59:04| Also, these devices, once they're strapped on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10744)|
| 2:59:07| they provide continuous chest compressions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| until they're taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10749)|
| 2:59:10| And normally, that would be at the ER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10750)|
| 2:59:13| or sometimes even in the cath lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| So you can put these devices on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10756)|
| 2:59:18| They continue to do chest compressions, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| as I said before, is so important in CPR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| and getting a pulse back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10765)|
| 2:59:30| And then you can move the individual around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10770)|
| 2:59:33| The chest compressions are still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| Move them up and down stairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10775)|
| 2:59:36| Put them on the gurney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| Take them to the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10778)|
| 2:59:39| Still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| On the way to the hospital, normally what we have to do now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| one of our firefighters rides in the back of the ambulance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| doing chest compressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| And sometimes it's as awkward as you're holding on with one hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10789)|
| 2:59:53| and doing your best to do chest compressions with the other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| which obviously, you're not able to do ideal chest compressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10795)|
| 2:59:59| Plus, there's always a chance of an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10799)|
| 3:00:01| We could have an injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10801)|
| 3:00:02| With these devices, they'll still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| need one of our firefighters to ride along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| But he can be buckled up while they're in the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| We've had a couple of these devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| the one that's in the brochure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| says the Lucas devices, on loan from Rural Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10815)|
| 3:00:20| for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10820)|
| 3:00:21| And we've had really good results out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10821)|
| 3:00:24| So we're not requesting these blindly without already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10824)|
| 3:00:29| having some data to back it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| We're getting much better results in our CPR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10831)|
| 3:00:37| with these devices versus our normal mechanical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10837)|
| 3:00:42| I mean, without the mechanical device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| Just a little bit of stats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| These are in all of Knox County in 2013, with traditional CPR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10846)|
| 3:00:55| there was a 12% return of spontaneous circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10855)|
| 3:01:01| Well, with these devices, we had 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| So the firefighters that have actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10865)|
| 3:01:09| I've talked with several of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10869)|
| 3:01:10| And one of the things they ask, because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10870)|
| 3:01:13| are on loan from Rural Metro, is please don't ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| take these away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10876)|
| 3:01:17| And we've seen such good results with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10877)|
| 3:01:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10881)|
| 3:01:21| You may have seen one of the TV channels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10881)|
| 3:01:25| had one of our firefighters who's used this device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| And he did a little demonstration of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10887)|
| 3:01:30| I guess I can't say for sure, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10890)|
| 3:01:32| can tell you that we've had a lot of good results with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10892)|
| 3:01:35| And he did a little demonstration of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10895)|
| 3:01:38| I guess I could have brought that in and done a demo here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| But honestly, frankly, I didn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| to take it off one of the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| And we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| But anyway, I'll be glad to take any questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10906)|
| 3:01:49| So what we'll be able to do is we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10909)|
| 3:01:50| be able to purchase 20 of these devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10910)|
| 3:01:52| They are very expensive, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10912)|
| 3:01:54| There's two companies that make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| The way they make these is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| Those two devices are quite different from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| So we'll have to evaluate which road we want to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10923)|
| 3:02:06| But the cost is about the same on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10926)|
| 3:02:08| They have an expected life cycle of about 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10928)|
| 3:02:12| And we're looking at purchasing 20 of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10932)|
| 3:02:16| and putting them on each one of our engines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| so that they'll be on all of the first responder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| calls with our engines respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10945)|
| 3:02:26| I just wanted to thank the chief and his men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10946)|
| 3:02:29| I think more of the public knows about the first responder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10949)|
| 3:02:34| program than anything else you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10954)|
| 3:02:36| Obviously, putting out fires is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| But you hear that siren coming down the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10958)|
| 3:02:41| and you think someone's life might be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10961)|
| 3:02:43| And that's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10963)|
| 3:02:44| And obviously, this is a tool that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10964)|
| 3:02:45| going to help you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10965)|
| 3:02:46| So I commend you and your guys for the work you do on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| What's the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10970)|
| 3:02:51| How much do they cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| They are approximately, I guess they suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10973)|
| 3:02:57| retail price is around $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| Obviously, we should get a better rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10980)|
| 3:03:02| for buying 20 of them, which they'll have to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10982)|
| 3:03:05| to bid at that price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10985)|
| 3:03:10| There was one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| Yes, I don't know if you're going to talk separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| about the million and a half sprinkler and alarm fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| station thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10996)|
| 3:03:17| But that's a pretty big item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| So what's the deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=10999)|
| 3:03:20| Yeah, I'll be glad to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| What we're requesting there is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| want to install sprinklers and sprinkler monitoring systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11005)|
| 3:03:29| at all of our fire stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11009)|
| 3:03:30| Three of them have it right now, the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11010)|
| 3:03:34| that are either new or have been renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11014)|
| 3:03:37| And sprinklers, I mean, I know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| know some about the importance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| They save buildings, and they save lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11021)|
| 3:03:44| They use a whole lot less water because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11024)|
| 3:03:47| get to the fire quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11027)|
| 3:03:48| And usually, one sprinkler head can put the fire out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11028)|
| 3:03:52| or at least keep it at bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11032)|
| 3:03:53| Actually, what we're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| that's the cost of the entire project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| All we're requesting is a 10% matching funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11037)|
| 3:04:01| We're requesting $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| Big money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11043)|
| 3:04:04| It's federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11044)|
| 3:04:06| Again, it's not guaranteed, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| going to apply to the AFG, the Firefighters Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11048)|
| 3:04:12| This has been one thing that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| have emphasized over the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| is fire station renovations, especially with alarm systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| and sprinkler systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11060)|
| 3:04:21| So we think we have a decent chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11061)|
| 3:04:23| of being able to get this grant and get sprinklers installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11063)|
| 3:04:28| for $150,000 of our monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11068)|
| 3:04:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11075)|
| 3:04:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11075)|
| 3:04:37| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11077)|
| 3:04:38| Chief, speaking of grants, are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| grants available for what you were just speaking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11080)|
| 3:04:46| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| There are some fire grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11089)|
| 3:04:50| There's nowhere near as many fire grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| as there are police grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| There's a general fire grant that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11094)|
| 3:04:55| provides funding for some fire apparatus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11095)|
| 3:05:01| And there's a fire grant that provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| some funding for education, public fire education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| But I do not know of any grant for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11107)|
| 3:05:11| But we will obviously keep pursuing grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11111)|
| 3:05:14| for things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| And Chief Roush has kindly let us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| use, as an expert, a couple of his people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11119)|
| 3:05:24| of his grant writers, to help us with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| because they have the real expertise in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11126)|
| 3:05:29| They seem to have the water of which to find that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11129)|
| 3:05:32| That would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11132)|
| 3:05:35| So can you comment on the training academy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11135)|
| 3:05:40| What's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:41| $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11141)|
| 3:05:42| What's the money for there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11142)|
| 3:05:43| And what was the $200,000 for last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| So I can answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11146)|
| 3:05:48| So the training academy for KPD was at Moses Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11148)|
| 3:05:52| So they need to get a new training academy open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11152)|
| 3:05:55| before they get re-inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11155)|
| 3:05:57| Fire department has had issues where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11157)|
| 3:06:00| they're training for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11160)|
| 3:06:01| Prosser Road, because of the movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11161)|
| 3:06:04| that occurs on that site, and because of just the lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11164)|
| 3:06:07| of facilities that are there, they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11167)|
| 3:06:10| haven't been in need of a training facility for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11170)|
| 3:06:12| So the thought is that we would create a dual training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11172)|
| 3:06:17| facility for both KPD and KFD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11177)|
| 3:06:19| And we've been working towards that probably the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11179)|
| 3:06:22| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11182)|
| 3:06:23| And we've identified a site that is near Cement Plant Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| where the current KPD facility is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11187)|
| 3:06:30| that could work and be the right kind of size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| for supporting both the KPD and KFD training facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11192)|
| 3:06:36| And the objective is, of course, if we have a combined facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11196)|
| 3:06:40| we get great economies of scale for our training areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11200)|
| 3:06:45| our rooms, bathrooms, common areas, locker rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11205)|
| 3:06:48| all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| And both the chiefs are very supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11210)|
| 3:06:52| of this dual facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11212)|
| 3:06:54| But the allocation of funds from both KPD and KFD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11214)|
| 3:06:58| are just accumulating funds in hopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11218)|
| 3:07:01| of acquiring that property and then building the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| We've done some preliminary programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11224)|
| 3:07:07| through an architect to help determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| what size of facility we need and the support services that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11229)|
| 3:07:12| are required there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| And we think we have a site identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| And we came to a verbal agreement on the purchase price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11236)|
| 3:07:19| last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11239)|
| 3:07:20| So now we have to do all those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| that Charles Swanson was talking about earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11242)|
| 3:07:24| and get it down in writing in a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11244)|
| 3:07:27| And then once we do that, we'll come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11247)|
| 3:07:29| and we'll be able to tell you more about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11249)|
| 3:07:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11253)|
| 3:07:34| $10 million wonder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11254)|
| 3:07:35| What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11257)|
| 3:07:38| $10 million project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11258)|
| 3:07:39| No, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| And truthfully, KPD needs it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11261)|
| 3:07:44| I mean, KFD has a site right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11264)|
| 3:07:45| If you guys have been out there, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11265)|
| 3:07:47| which I recommend you do, as I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| they definitely need some help, KFD does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11270)|
| 3:07:53| But KPD has to have it because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11273)|
| 3:07:56| will have their recertification within the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11276)|
| 3:07:59| And as you guys know, they moved out of Moses Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11279)|
| 3:08:01| so they had to get a new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11281)|
| 3:08:03| In the interim, they're using the training facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11283)|
| 3:08:05| out at Cement Plant Road, where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| have multipurpose rooms and some other rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11287)|
| 3:08:09| that kind of fill in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11289)|
| 3:08:10| But long term, they have to have a training facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11290)|
| 3:08:13| for their accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11293)|
| 3:08:14| So no, it will not be a $10 million facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11294)|
| 3:08:17| But our programming, we're working with an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11297)|
| 3:08:20| as I said before, just to program that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11300)|
| 3:08:22| We'll come back with a better estimate before too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11302)|
| 3:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11307)|
| 3:08:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11310)|
| 3:08:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11313)|
| 3:08:33| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11313)|
| 3:08:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| Civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| OK, for civil service, in the handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| it's the top of page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11321)|
| 3:08:46| My new best friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| We've gotten to spend a lot of time together lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11329)|
| 3:08:52| Seems like we were just here talking about salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11332)|
| 3:08:55| but we're now on our regular time schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11335)|
| 3:08:58| So we wrapped up our in-house salary survey in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| and I sent all of you guys the results of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| And I just wanted to briefly summarize those results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11345)|
| 3:09:08| tie them to the ordinance that I have before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11348)|
| 3:09:12| right now with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| Really, in my opinion, we've really met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| our goals on salary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| If you look at our ranges in general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11360)|
| 3:09:24| anything within 5% high or low would be considered acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11364)|
| 3:09:29| So if you look at the differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11369)|
| 3:09:32| between our actual midpoints, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| what the range is built from, and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11374)|
| 3:09:37| that we found in the survey, you'll see that we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11377)|
| 3:09:39| well on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| Most of those that were not on target were high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11382)|
| 3:09:45| So in my opinion, our salary structures look great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11385)|
| 3:09:48| In general government, we're right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11388)|
| 3:09:51| In almost all of our ranges, our higher pay grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11391)|
| 3:09:55| have actually moved a little bit above market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| In fire, fire is a little more mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| Fire, we have, you kind of start off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11403)|
| 3:10:06| we're a little high in our lower ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11406)|
| 3:10:09| And as you move to the higher ranks, we level off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11409)|
| 3:10:12| And in police, we're pretty much on target, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11412)|
| 3:10:16| all the way through police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| You see a couple of differences in the PO ranks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11417)|
| 3:10:21| but part of that is just a product of matching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| We have five ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11423)|
| 3:10:24| Very few municipalities have that many ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11424)|
| 3:10:27| So we do get some awkward matching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11427)|
| 3:10:30| So it sort of throws those salaries a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11430)|
| 3:10:32| but when you look at them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11432)|
| 3:10:34| I think they're very well on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11434)|
| 3:10:36| So because our salary structures, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| look really healthy right now, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11439)|
| 3:10:42| are no changes to the salary structure before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| The only changes I recommended are just some new job classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| that individual departments need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| some reallocations to match up with some of the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11452)|
| 3:10:55| that we did back in February, and a couple of retitles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| just to adjust some titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11458)|
| 3:11:00| The only other thing I wanted to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11460)|
| 3:11:02| is I did do an analysis of actual average salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11462)|
| 3:11:06| because we don't typically use the salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11466)|
| 3:11:08| survey to address actual pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11468)|
| 3:11:10| It's usually just to address the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11470)|
| 3:11:12| and I bring structure recommendations to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11472)|
| 3:11:15| But because of what we started back in 2007 with Mercer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11475)|
| 3:11:19| at that time, we found we were about 30% below market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11479)|
| 3:11:24| And since then, we've made several efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11484)|
| 3:11:26| with what we did through Mercer, and then again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11486)|
| 3:11:29| with the Siegel study to just continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11489)|
| 3:11:31| to move those actual salaries more toward a market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11491)|
| 3:11:35| I wanted to give you a sense of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11495)|
| 3:11:37| we are now that we've completed all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| And we are very close to market on actual pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11500)|
| 3:11:44| Right now, on average, we're 4% below market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11504)|
| 3:11:48| which I think is a tremendous improvement over where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11508)|
| 3:11:52| we were in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11512)|
| 3:11:54| We still have a little room to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11514)|
| 3:11:56| but I think it's very attainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| We're very close to actually having both our structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11518)|
| 3:12:01| and our actual pay at market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11521)|
| 3:12:04| I'd be happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11527)|
| 3:12:08| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11528)|
| 3:12:10| Vicky, we heard this morning, I guess before you got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| that as we have people retiring, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| looking at job structures and seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11537)|
| 3:12:21| with changed technology and how we do things differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11541)|
| 3:12:24| we might rework positions or duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11544)|
| 3:12:29| Could you talk about that briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11549)|
| 3:12:30| In other words, how your department gets involved in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11550)|
| 3:12:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11553)|
| 3:12:33| And I've actually seen a lot of that happening recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11553)|
| 3:12:37| We have had retirements in several departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| that have used those opportunities to reorganize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11561)|
| 3:12:45| Sometimes that results in downsizing of positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11565)|
| 3:12:50| I've seen several departments that have actually combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11570)|
| 3:12:53| Public service did quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| They really reworked some of their higher level positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| when they had quite a number of retirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| And in many of those cases, they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| combined jobs rather than filling two jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11583)|
| 3:13:06| that they had previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11586)|
| 3:13:07| They combined them into one job because new technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11587)|
| 3:13:11| new ways of doing things, new way that they're operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11591)|
| 3:13:14| allowed them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11594)|
| 3:13:16| We have some similar changes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11596)|
| 3:13:18| have been going on in inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11598)|
| 3:13:20| They've really been improving the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11600)|
| 3:13:22| that they're organized and structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11602)|
| 3:13:24| And they're using some retirements to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11604)|
| 3:13:26| and address that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| So we're just working with the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| to find out what position they had, what positions they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11610)|
| 3:13:35| In most cases, they're actually ending up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| with fewer positions that do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| So I'm seeing them become a lot more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| We're just helping them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| Does your group, in other words, make it fit the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11625)|
| 3:13:48| Or do you take an active role in redesigning activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11628)|
| 3:13:52| In other words, we work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11632)|
| 3:13:53| First, they tell us what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| They'll come to me and say, OK, this is the position I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11635)|
| 3:13:58| This is the position I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11638)|
| 3:14:00| When you see me bring an ordinance sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| that says new job class being created, actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11642)|
| 3:14:05| several of the ones that you see on this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11645)|
| 3:14:08| I've brought before you at the last meeting are just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11648)|
| 3:14:11| We look at the position they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11651)|
| 3:14:14| I find out what they actually need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11654)|
| 3:14:17| Sometimes we can rework the existing position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| and continue to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| Same title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11661)|
| 3:14:21| We just sort of adjust the duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11661)|
| 3:14:23| Sometimes it's a completely new position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| We eliminate the old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| We may combine one or two into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| new with a brand new title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| Then my group goes out and actually does the job analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11671)|
| 3:14:35| to create the position for them and create the testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11675)|
| 3:14:38| process and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11678)|
| 3:14:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11680)|
| 3:14:41| If I could just add, Vicki's been incredibly helpful too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11681)|
| 3:14:44| in helping us figure out how to do that the easiest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11684)|
| 3:14:47| way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11687)|
| 3:14:48| So I appreciate her and her staff helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11688)|
| 3:14:52| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11692)|
| 3:14:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11693)|
| 3:14:54| I have a comment or question, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11694)|
| 3:14:57| concerning what we're paying as a minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11697)|
| 3:15:00| I think it's about $10 per hour for our lowest paid employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11700)|
| 3:15:07| which is really not much when you think in terms of a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11707)|
| 3:15:13| It is above what is the federal or state minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11713)|
| 3:15:17| But I'd really like to see that $10 increased if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11717)|
| 3:15:23| Now you have Mr. Jim York there, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| know he would say that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11725)|
| 3:15:27| a great expense for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11727)|
| 3:15:29| But I think we really need to look at increasing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| I mean, one of the things that we do, and we have entry level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11734)|
| 3:15:39| and again, I'm not quite sure what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| It's a little over 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11741)|
| 3:15:42| But we have a pretty fast movement upwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11742)|
| 3:15:47| in our lowest paid PS worker ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11747)|
| 3:15:51| But we've done some things to speed up that process so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11751)|
| 3:15:56| that they can move up the ladder fairly quickly and bump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11756)|
| 3:16:01| above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11761)|
| 3:16:02| And again, I know that's one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11762)|
| 3:16:04| that services wanted to do, and we've tried to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11764)|
| 3:16:08| So I know I'm cheap, but sometimes I think I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11768)|
| 3:16:11| It would be good if we started out above 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11771)|
| 3:16:14| Because I don't know what $10 an hour per year, what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11774)|
| 3:16:18| but that's low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11778)|
| 3:16:20| And that's a hard wage for people to live on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11780)|
| 3:16:24| And I think the city should set an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11784)|
| 3:16:27| and try to raise that if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| And we could if we want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11789)|
| 3:16:32| It just takes the will to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11792)|
| 3:16:37| Well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| Councilman DelaValle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11800)|
| 3:16:41| Yeah, I just want to say the flip side, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11801)|
| 3:16:43| is that economically, you can get more people in at $10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11803)|
| 3:16:47| an hour and find out who are the good employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| and move them up quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| I mean, it's an opportunity sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| to get that entry level job because you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11813)|
| 3:16:55| moving into a career path that's going to reward you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11815)|
| 3:16:59| And I realize what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11819)|
| 3:17:00| that it's not, in your mind, a wage that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11820)|
| 3:17:04| can support a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11824)|
| 3:17:05| But the flip side is, you can get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11825)|
| 3:17:07| started on a very good career by having a low entry level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| So you've got to balance those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| And I don't know who makes that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| Well, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11834)|
| 3:17:14| I mean, you know, it is above whatever the minimum wage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11834)|
| 3:17:20| I'm not sure exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11840)|
| 3:17:22| I don't know if it's $7 an hour, $10, $25, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11842)|
| 3:17:26| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| But I would just like to see it be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11854)|
| 3:17:35| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:35| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:38| We're kind of at a crossroads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11858)|
| 3:17:41| Ms. Branscom, what would your pleasure be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| I see public service back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11864)|
| 3:17:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11865)|
| 3:17:46| I mean, it's up to you guys, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| It's your legislative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11868)|
| 3:17:50| But David is here, if you guys want to go ahead and jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11870)|
| 3:17:51| on that before we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11871)|
| 3:17:52| Well, and Mr. Jensen's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| Mr. Jensen's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11874)|
| 3:17:55| Are you guys good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11875)|
| 3:17:56| We've still got public forum at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| You can't change that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11878)|
| 3:17:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11879)|
| 3:18:00| I think you just take this thing and just move it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| We can go ahead and watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11883)|
| 3:18:06| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11886)|
| 3:18:07| Which would you rather?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11887)|
| 3:18:08| Can't change the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11888)|
| 3:18:09| Well, let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11889)|
| 3:18:10| I think the ones that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11890)|
| 3:18:16| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11896)|
| 3:18:17| Still morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11897)|
| 3:18:18| David Brace, the director of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11898)|
| 3:18:22| I think public service has had, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| talked about civil service and reorganizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11904)|
| 3:18:27| and looking at positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11907)|
| 3:18:28| That's really been our focus since Chad Weth and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| and Christy Branscombe and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11911)|
| 3:18:32| have been involved in service over the last three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11912)|
| 3:18:35| to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11915)|
| 3:18:36| We're really focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11916)|
| 3:18:37| We're a $35 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11917)|
| 3:18:41| About a third of that is outsourced to the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| to our solid waste contractors and to contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11923)|
| 3:18:46| who mow and do right-of-way maintenance and other services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11926)|
| 3:18:50| in direct contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11930)|
| 3:18:52| Have about 304 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11932)|
| 3:18:54| There's a few positions that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| have filled now that we're looking at long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11936)|
| 3:18:59| to see if we need to fill them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11939)|
| 3:19:00| Our focus right now is really three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| Reorganization and people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11944)|
| 3:19:05| How do we need to use our human resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11945)|
| 3:19:08| We're building a new complex, which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11948)|
| 3:19:10| hope will make us more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11950)|
| 3:19:11| We believe will make us more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11951)|
| 3:19:13| We actually broke ground today on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| And then integration of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11955)|
| 3:19:17| So we're in the process of implementing our AVL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11957)|
| 3:19:22| Automatic Vehicle Locator, system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11962)|
| 3:19:25| We've got that on about 50 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11965)|
| 3:19:29| 100 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11969)|
| 3:19:30| And we're about to go to the next 100 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11970)|
| 3:19:32| So we're about to get down from, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11972)|
| 3:19:35| was one of those programs that obviously employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11975)|
| 3:19:38| have a little concern about because they're being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11978)|
| 3:19:40| tracked in their vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11980)|
| 3:19:41| So we started with our managers first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11981)|
| 3:19:43| Wanted to start at the top and move our way down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11983)|
| 3:19:46| to our field level employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11986)|
| 3:19:47| And so we're about to do the next 100 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| And so we see that as important for both accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11989)|
| 3:19:53| and for efficiency and operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11993)|
| 3:19:56| And technology also with our new work order system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11996)|
| 3:20:00| We're in the process of implementing that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12000)|
| 3:20:03| It's an Acela work order system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| Right now we have many siloed work order systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| So it's hard to track data and to use data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| in a way that's meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12009)|
| 3:20:11| I think 311, Russ is here, has been really helpful for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12011)|
| 3:20:15| as we use data to make decisions about budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12015)|
| 3:20:18| and about resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12018)|
| 3:20:19| And so that's really the third leg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12019)|
| 3:20:21| of what we're working on right now is technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| People, facilities, and technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12023)|
| 3:20:25| And so I'm open to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12025)|
| 3:20:27| I think we really do want to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12027)|
| 3:20:29| at how we use our people and our equipment in the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| efficient way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| Are we getting good quality work out of our folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| And are we doing it in a way that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12035)|
| 3:20:37| accountable to both you and to the mayor and to the citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12037)|
| 3:20:41| David, I just want to say, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12041)|
| 3:20:42| can't tell you how much I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| Sometimes I'm like, gosh, I'm going to email him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| And you all always meet the work head on and with a smile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12047)|
| 3:20:52| And like I say, sometimes I'm just hesitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12052)|
| 3:20:56| I'm like, gosh, I'm just wearing them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12056)|
| 3:20:57| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| I know you've had a hard year to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12059)|
| 3:21:02| But it's just fantastic that the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12062)|
| 3:21:04| that you all do on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12064)|
| 3:21:07| The men and women there, it's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12067)|
| 3:21:08| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12068)|
| 3:21:09| It is National Public Works Week, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12069)|
| 3:21:12| We were up in the mayor's office, Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12072)|
| 3:21:14| And when you think of public works, it's fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12074)|
| 3:21:17| It's parks and rec, building inspection, service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12077)|
| 3:21:20| engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12080)|
| 3:21:21| You kind of throw utilities in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| KUB does their own event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| But it's a good time to recognize what our folks do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| They're the behind the scenes people that we kind of swoop in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12087)|
| 3:21:31| I always say Boomsday is a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12091)|
| 3:21:33| You leave Boomsday, and there's just stuff everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12093)|
| 3:21:36| And the next morning, you get up, you go to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| and nail and drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| Looks like nothing ever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12099)|
| 3:21:40| And that's really what our job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12100)|
| 3:21:42| So I appreciate that, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12104)|
| 3:21:45| Yeah, a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12105)|
| 3:21:46| Dave, what kind of adjustments have you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12106)|
| 3:21:49| made in response to having that AVL?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12109)|
| 3:21:52| And what kind of response have you seen from your employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12112)|
| 3:21:55| Well, there was an initial kind of pushback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12115)|
| 3:21:58| Fortunately, when I was on a fire truck at Rural Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12118)|
| 3:22:01| I went through that 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12121)|
| 3:22:02| This is not a new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12122)|
| 3:22:04| AVL, AVL tracking systems have been out there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12124)|
| 3:22:08| The market embraced them 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| So I went through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12130)|
| 3:22:11| And so I could experience that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| I remember when I was on a fire truck out off North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12133)|
| 3:22:16| Drive, it was a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12136)|
| 3:22:19| We were concerned about it as employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| But within 12 months, it was like nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12141)|
| 3:22:23| It just didn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12143)|
| 3:22:24| It really helped you do your job better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12144)|
| 3:22:26| It made sure you were safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12146)|
| 3:22:28| So I would say we're on the very front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12148)|
| 3:22:30| of learning how to use the AVL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12150)|
| 3:22:33| It helps with accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| Are you where you're supposed to be, and are you working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| That's kind of the very front line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12157)|
| 3:22:39| What we can do with AVL in the future, I think, is wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12159)|
| 3:22:42| And we actually met the other day, Jesse and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12162)|
| 3:22:44| and Janet, Ms. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12164)|
| 3:22:46| We talked about data and some projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12166)|
| 3:22:49| that we want to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12169)|
| 3:22:51| I mean, imagine having a citizen access, a big screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12171)|
| 3:22:55| that a citizen could go to on a web page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12175)|
| 3:22:58| And you could see all the salt plows and all the salt trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12178)|
| 3:23:01| out there and actually see where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12181)|
| 3:23:02| And then we could take 311 data and plot calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12182)|
| 3:23:06| And maybe we've got all our trucks here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12186)|
| 3:23:07| but all our calls are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12187)|
| 3:23:08| And let's move those over in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12188)|
| 3:23:11| So that's where we want to get to with AVL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12191)|
| 3:23:13| Right now, it's really about accountability and driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12195)|
| 3:23:16| So are people where they're supposed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12196)|
| 3:23:18| Do we have a risk component with how people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12198)|
| 3:23:20| are operating the vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12200)|
| 3:23:22| And the other part of that risk piece is people do oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12202)|
| 3:23:25| get us confused with the county and the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12205)|
| 3:23:29| So we get, hey, your truck hit me and drove off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| Well, AVL, we can actually look on that system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12212)|
| 3:23:34| and say, we weren't on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12214)|
| 3:23:37| Maybe it was one of our other partners out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12217)|
| 3:23:40| But right now, it's accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12220)|
| 3:23:41| And it's really about driver education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12221)|
| 3:23:46| And secondly, you said you broke ground on your new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12226)|
| 3:23:49| Who did you award the contract to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12229)|
| 3:23:50| And when do you think you'll be finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12230)|
| 3:23:52| Yeah, so phase one of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12232)|
| 3:23:54| which will be a new building for, and I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12234)|
| 3:23:56| We've worked on this for nearly a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| The new building will be done in about 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| Blaine Construction is the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12241)|
| 3:24:04| Barbara McMurray is the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12244)|
| 3:24:05| And we've been working with them for the past 12 to 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12245)|
| 3:24:09| months, a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12249)|
| 3:24:10| This building is going to have really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12250)|
| 3:24:12| where we're going to consolidate public service employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12252)|
| 3:24:15| The top floor will be engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12255)|
| 3:24:17| So there's going to be a new modern engineering office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12259)|
| 3:24:20| The lower level will have the health and wellness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12260)|
| 3:24:23| center for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12263)|
| 3:24:24| And then traffic engineering, this is the big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12264)|
| 3:24:27| They've always been isolated up at Elm Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12267)|
| 3:24:29| And so Mr. Hagerman will have all his traffic engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| team brought into this building under one management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12271)|
| 3:24:36| I would say just my experience, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12276)|
| 3:24:37| you have folks away from your central operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12277)|
| 3:24:41| oftentimes it's challenging to have accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12281)|
| 3:24:45| and to make sure there's productive, efficient work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| So that building, again, is 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12287)|
| 3:24:50| And we look forward to having it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| It will also have a great public meeting space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12292)|
| 3:24:55| We'll have a large meeting room where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| we can do trainings internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| But it's going to have a new parking lot, accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12302)|
| 3:25:03| We can open this up for meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12303)|
| 3:25:04| It could seat about 125 folks in chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12304)|
| 3:25:08| It'll have modern AVL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12308)|
| 3:25:10| So being able to do these public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12310)|
| 3:25:12| it's challenging to get in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12312)|
| 3:25:14| So if we're going to do our project meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| that's probably going to be an area that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12316)|
| 3:25:18| default to in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12318)|
| 3:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12321)|
| 3:25:23| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12323)|
| 3:25:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12324)|
| 3:25:25| I'm sure everyone here seconds what Vice Mayor Pavlis said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12325)|
| 3:25:28| that we appreciate the responsiveness of your group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| It really is a breath of fresh air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12331)|
| 3:25:34| as far as getting delivery to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12334)|
| 3:25:37| A couple of questions real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12337)|
| 3:25:39| Recycling, are we still getting new bins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12339)|
| 3:25:42| and expanding the service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12342)|
| 3:25:44| Or have we sort of frozen it where it's at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12344)|
| 3:25:46| Yeah, and I'm glad you brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12346)|
| 3:25:48| So recycling, we did the initial 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12348)|
| 3:25:51| We bought another, and I want to say, about 3,000 more carts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12351)|
| 3:25:54| because we had a wait list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12354)|
| 3:25:56| We took care of about 1,000 people on that wait list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12356)|
| 3:25:58| And about every month, we'll have about 100 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12358)|
| 3:26:01| call in and want to join the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12361)|
| 3:26:04| So we're distributing carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12364)|
| 3:26:07| Every couple of months, we'll go deliver 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12367)|
| 3:26:09| So we've got about another 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| I would have to check on the exact number for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| Councilman De La Bope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12373)|
| 3:26:14| But we've got a few carts to get us through the next, say, year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12374)|
| 3:26:20| And that kind of tees us up because we're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12380)|
| 3:26:22| bidding out solid waste in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12382)|
| 3:26:26| So here in about six months, seven months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12386)|
| 3:26:29| we're going to actually really start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12389)|
| 3:26:31| looking at our bid documents and working with Mr. Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12391)|
| 3:26:34| and purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12394)|
| 3:26:35| Again, there's about $10 million in solid waste contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12395)|
| 3:26:39| And we're going to bid out garbage collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| recycling collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| We're going to bid out our yard waste program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| So the organic material we pick up in the knuckle booms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12405)|
| 3:26:48| we take that to Shamrock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| So those are three major contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| And we're going to bid those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12412)|
| 3:26:54| And there's lots of options that we've got to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12414)|
| 3:26:56| We've obviously, there are certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12416)|
| 3:26:57| we'd love to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12417)|
| 3:26:58| We'd love to have everybody have a recycling bin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12418)|
| 3:27:00| Can we afford it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12420)|
| 3:27:01| Are there ways that we can structure that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12421)|
| 3:27:04| that drive down current costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12424)|
| 3:27:06| I know Mayor Rojero and Ms. Branscom and Mr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12426)|
| 3:27:09| are very interested in, can we do a waste to energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12429)|
| 3:27:12| with our yard waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12432)|
| 3:27:13| You know, we have 30,000 tons of yard waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12433)|
| 3:27:16| Can we take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12436)|
| 3:27:17| There's some newer technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| It's emerging technology to make diesel, to make power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12439)|
| 3:27:22| And so we're actually going to be doing an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12442)|
| 3:27:25| working with Mr. York, to bring in a consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| to help look at our entire solid waste system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12447)|
| 3:27:30| You know, that'll be money well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12450)|
| 3:27:31| When you look at solid waste contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| you're oftentimes looking at 15, 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| which is good from a city standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12456)|
| 3:27:38| because those contracts are so labor and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12458)|
| 3:27:41| excuse me, capital intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| If you do short garbage contracts, the price goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12463)|
| 3:27:46| So we got to make sure that we're really looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12466)|
| 3:27:48| around the corner 20 years and making good decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12468)|
| 3:27:51| about how we do solid waste, recycling, yard waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12471)|
| 3:27:54| But to answer your base question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12474)|
| 3:27:56| yes, we still have demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12476)|
| 3:27:58| Yes, we're still delivering carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12478)|
| 3:27:59| We've got about a year left, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12479)|
| 3:28:02| assuming the trend of about 100 people a month continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12482)|
| 3:28:05| Is ROC-10 still your main processor of the materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12485)|
| 3:28:08| Yeah, ROC-10 is still the main processor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| They have a very strong interest in growing the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12490)|
| 3:28:13| They have a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12493)|
| 3:28:14| They've been growing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| They would love for the city to grow its customer base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12496)|
| 3:28:18| so they can see more materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12498)|
| 3:28:20| So ROC-10 is still our key contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12500)|
| 3:28:23| Has anyone figured out how to get rid of the glass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| Glass is still an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12505)|
| 3:28:27| I had a discussion the other day with somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| that was like, can we take the glass out of the waste stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| I said, no, we're going to keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| It is heavy and it's challenging to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12513)|
| 3:28:36| And no one has come up with a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12516)|
| 3:28:38| for glass that's still a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12518)|
| 3:28:42| The last question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12522)|
| 3:28:44| and I don't know that I'm mixing up cause and effect here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12524)|
| 3:28:47| but it seems like the salt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| which protects us all driving in the bad weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| seems to really eat up the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| especially where the seams are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| It must help the degradation of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12535)|
| 3:28:57| Are you finding more maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| right after salt application in the next month or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12539)|
| 3:29:02| The research tells us that salt really does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12542)|
| 3:29:05| have a truly negative effect on asphalt or concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12545)|
| 3:29:09| It blows out in the winter from expansion, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| No, I mean, what really kills us is the extreme temperatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12551)|
| 3:29:15| And we had extreme temperatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12555)|
| 3:29:16| It was cold for, not for a day, for multiple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12556)|
| 3:29:20| And so that freeze thaw, we had a lot of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12560)|
| 3:29:22| a lot of moisture, and then we had exceedingly cold weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12562)|
| 3:29:25| And then it thawed out and we had more cold weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12565)|
| 3:29:28| That's really what causes problems with surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12568)|
| 3:29:31| Thermal expansion in the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12571)|
| 3:29:32| Yeah, I mean, you have a freeze thaw and it expands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12572)|
| 3:29:34| and then it shrinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12574)|
| 3:29:35| And so, but the salt really does not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12575)|
| 3:29:38| I mean, ideally you're not going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12578)|
| 3:29:40| a career on your road surfaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12580)|
| 3:29:41| but it's such a short amount of time that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12581)|
| 3:29:44| and speaking of technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12584)|
| 3:29:47| one project we're looking at with Ornell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| since you brought up salt, is working with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12589)|
| 3:29:52| of their GIS folks at the Oak Ridge National Lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12592)|
| 3:29:54| They've got some technology that allows us to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12594)|
| 3:29:57| and they worked with our solar folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| up in the Sustainability Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12599)|
| 3:30:00| Where do we have streets that are shady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12600)|
| 3:30:03| versus streets that are more, you know, get more sunlight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12603)|
| 3:30:07| And can we modify our program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| Right now it's like a shotgun program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12609)|
| 3:30:11| We just salt everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12611)|
| 3:30:12| And can we get into a situation in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12612)|
| 3:30:15| where we don't have to spend two and $300,000 on salt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12615)|
| 3:30:18| Could we be very specific through technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| through GIS and AVL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12620)|
| 3:30:22| to where we don't have to use all that, those resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12622)|
| 3:30:24| So we're looking at that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12624)|
| 3:30:26| It's down the road, but we're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12626)|
| 3:30:27| Smart salt, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12627)|
| 3:30:28| Smart salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12628)|
| 3:30:29| That will be-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12629)|
| 3:30:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12630)|
| 3:30:31| That gets more expensive when it gets smart, though, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12631)|
| 3:30:32| Don't call it smart salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12632)|
| 3:30:37| Good job, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12637)|
| 3:30:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12638)|
| 3:30:40| Any further questions or things for Mr. Bryce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12640)|
| 3:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12643)|
| 3:30:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12644)|
| 3:30:44| I'm a huge fan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=12644)|
