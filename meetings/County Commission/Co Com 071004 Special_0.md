| 0:01:27| Commissioner Mark Harmon is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| We have 15 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| We have 16 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| You stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| As usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| Consideration of the rebidding process for contract for an insurance administrator for the county self-funded health insurance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=109)|
| 0:01:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Mr. Troy or Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| Yeah, I'd like the chairman of the insurance committee to make a report if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| First, I'd like to take in you have some handouts there in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| I'd like to take the opportunity to recognize the committee that has worked diligently on this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| John Troyer, Larry Smith, Frances Fogerson, Megan Ambern, Chief Bivens, and Mr. Rick Trott of the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| Joy McCroskey of the criminal court clerk, Tim Wheeler, circuit court clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| John Williams and Michael Passeur of the Knox County clerk, Nick McBride with the register of deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| Mackie Harper with the attorney general's office, Sam Harb of the Knox County trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| and Mr. Ralph Watson was placed on the committee by Mr. John Whitehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| I do believe he has been vacationing or should I say honeymooning during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| We have contacted Mr. Whitehead and he's been informed and aware of the meetings that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| This committee has worked very, very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| They've worked very, very hard over the last week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| I can't say enough good things about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| We have had extremely constructive discussions regarding the insurance for Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| The committee first met on September 26 at 1.30 to review our charge as a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| And we all agreed that our charge was to conduct an open and competitive process by which we solicit a bid for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=204)|
| 0:03:33| self-insured medical administration services, disease management services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| pharmacy benefit management services, and stop-loss insurance while creating the best insurance plans for the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| that the taxpayers will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| The insurance committee we have since met on September 27th, September 28th, October 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| and October 3rd with almost 100 percent participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| When I say almost 100 percent, it's hard to cram five days almost right in a row| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| when people have already scheduled meetings and different things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| So everybody has been great in trying to rework their schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| And, you know, the participation was probably 99.99 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| It was that good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| And I appreciate that from these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Each meeting we had was in excess of two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| PBA has been wonderful and let me to reserve the room behind us in the small assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| We had a, like I said, very long and very positive construction, constructive discussion regarding this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| After several reviews and modifications of the draft bid document, we did get a unanimous approval yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=276)|
| 0:04:44| We have been over this each and every time that we have met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| That's typically been the first item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| And that's the first order of business that we conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| We finally all came to agreement yesterday on the document that we'd like to send out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| In wanting the employees to have choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| the committee approved adding a fourth plan that we didn't currently have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| The fourth plan will be called the employee's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| Still a PPO plan, just a little bit richer benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| The committee also approved lowering the deductibles as originally set out in all of the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| You can have the 2008 proposed plan design attached to your documents this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| This was also unanimously approved for the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| Understanding that the insurance premiums have seen double-digit increases over the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| we have tried very hard to ease this burden by minimizing premium increases while enhancing these benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| And I think you will see later on in your handouts that Knox County's contribution is plan neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| With that report, I'd like to move over to the next item, which would be the proposed timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=358)|
| 0:06:08| As you can see, this is a very condensed time frame that we have to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| We are willing to do it in this time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| The time frame calls for us basically issuing a bid tomorrow, hopefully before 12 noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=380)|
| 0:06:28| Those bids would be due October 19th at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| At that point, they will be publicly open and read aloud, and we will proceed with evaluations immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=393)|
| 0:06:42| If need be, we have the 22nd that I would be able to tally everyone's individual evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| come up with a cumulative store as before, and issue an intent to award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| We also have been placed on your meeting for the 22nd for the full commission to consider that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=416)|
| 0:07:06| Finalize some legal considerations of the contract, 1023 through 1029,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| and start developing materials and educating our employees directly after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=432)|
| 0:07:23| The other thing we'd like to report on is you can see this is an actual page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| This is page number 15 of the draft RFP, which is the proposed 2008 plan designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| We had originally started out with the consumer, the traditional, and the gold plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| We have since added the choice traditional PPO plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=461)|
| 0:07:53| With that being said, the committee is open for questions if there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| You opened the bids on the 19th at 10 o'clock, and you said you will begin scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| So take me through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| And what I'm after here is to make sure that this process is not going to be out in the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| so others can come back and say, wait a minute, we should have done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| In other words, I want to make sure that this is a fair process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| that everybody has an equal opportunity to make sure that they get their bids in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| that everybody's being considered fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| So take me through that, what will happen from October 19th at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| through October 22nd at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| October 19th, the bids will be opened at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| They'll be publicly read aloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| What I plan on doing is I have asked for 15 copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| I have 15 members to evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| I will get all the copies lined up for each individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| and get them to get the copies to those evaluation members Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| They have all agreed to look at this over the weekend, if not Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| I think there may be a vacation or two someone's wanting to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| They may fax theirs sometime Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| But they have agreed to look and score independently over the weekend if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| There's only two categories to score in the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| So it should really shorten the time frame that they would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| One of those is obviously price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| And when we look at price, there is a calculation that purchasing uses to determine price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| and price as to low bid and next low bid and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| So that will be very easily done and quickly done by the purchasing office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| They will be looking at the other category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Come Monday morning, I hope to have all of those evaluations in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| I will create an Excel spreadsheet or have that created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| All I'll need to do is plug in figures and then get cumulative scores for each bidder at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=584)|
| 0:09:52| Does anyone on this committee have any type of conflict of interest with regards to any of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| that are going to be submitting bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| Mr. Hammond, I'm licensed with several of those companies, and I'm not going to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Like I did last time, I just recused myself from it, and whatever the bid is is the bid is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| Are there any others that may have a potential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| None that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| We asked for conflicts the first day, and to the best of my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| I didn't remember hearing any other than I have insurance with one of the carriers that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| or may not propose, but I have insurance through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Yeah, I think all of the committee members enjoy the benefit of having health insurance through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| But outside of that, none were reporting to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| Now, you said that these are going to be individual tallies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| They'll be able to take them home and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| Do any of these committee members receive any telephone calls from any of those who have submitted bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| I think that should be disclosed and reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Mr. Hammond, those people could potentially be disqualified depending on the nature of the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| And that's why I think it should be disclosed if there's any contact at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Matt, you all have done a good job with this, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| The people on this list are the evaluation committee as well, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| You mentioned a while ago there are two categories, price and what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| Provider network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Well, one thing that I found out when I was talking to several employees is these provider directories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=679)|
| 0:11:29| are extremely confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| That's nothing that we can solve, but I would sure encourage the administrators to, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=693)|
| 0:11:41| doctors are not listed by their name in a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| They're listed in Knoxville Industrial and Medical, and the name may not be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| So that's very important for the employees to be able to go, okay, John Doe is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| He's my doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| The other thing, talk to me about a wellness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| There's a wellness center involved here somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| This would be a separate bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| It's not included in the administrative service office, but it will be a separate bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| It's a separate item on the October agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| The intent for the wellness center is to what we've got is about 20% of our claims are causing 80% of our costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=737)|
| 0:12:27| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| And the wellness center, the primary purpose is to address those 20% people who cause 80% of our costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| and try to do everything that we can to keep those costs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| The wellness center also then would be a side benefit, is an extra employee benefit choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| is that they can go for some care at no cost for the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| But that's really a side benefit, not the primary purpose of the wellness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| I think the wellness center has just got tremendous value to the county and to the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| and I think it's a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| We have a separate bid and separate bid evaluation going on as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| So do you think some of the administrators will bid on the wellness center as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| or will that be a different kind of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| I think it's a different kind of business, but they might bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| I haven't seen the bid, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| I don't know who's bidding on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| And it would be located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| Our intent, we evaluated several different areas, and our intent was at Knox Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| And we tried to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| It would have been nice in the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| but for everybody who does not work in the city county building, like our library personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| parks personnel, public works, they can't park here, and it's hard for them to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| How big does it need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| We want to start small and prove it the first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| and I think we'll be able to show some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| I think we'll be able to document savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| I think we'll be able to document how good it can be in the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| And the first time out, the blocks, the wellness center, every proposer was proposing too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| and we canceled them all and sent it back out and said we want to decrease the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| and we want to start smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| But just to make sure that this is going to be the right step for us, and I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| I noticed somewhere on here it said that free flu shots or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| Did I say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| No charge for yearly flu shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| Yeah, on the plan design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| So that's something they could get at the wellness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| I think that would be a good place to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Employee health maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| And we also think that we can coordinate with the sheriff's office to do some of the preliminary physicals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| and also do drug testing there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| John or whoever wants to answer, with the new appointees to this committee, how pleased are they with the plan now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=904)|
| 0:15:13| I know that was a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| We were looking at that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| How pleased are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| I think we've got several of them here, and maybe you could ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| I feel really strongly that these people worked very hard to come up with a good solution for the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| and a good solution for the employees, but they're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| Is there anybody here that would like to speak on how they feel about the plan now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| especially the new appointees to this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=937)|
| 0:15:46| Tim doesn't like to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| I tried to convince Nick, and he said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| I would like to reiterate a little bit of what Matt and John said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| We had several really good meetings where we put a lot out on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| There is a lot of discussion, at times disagreements, but we found common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| I think by adding the fourth plan, the employee's choice plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| and then coming down on the deductibles because in going back and speaking with the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| and I spoke with employees not only from the office I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| but throughout the city county building, the health department, a few people in the libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| county road department and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Their main concern, of course, was how much were they going to have to pay their premiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| and when they walk in the doctor's office, what the copay was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| or if they needed to have a procedure or go to the emergency room, what they would have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| And I think the plan before you addresses a lot of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| And we've -- John, I think, has had to work a couple of nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| Between me and Nick, we kept sending him back wanting some figures on maybe what premiums would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| Well, John enjoys that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| You'd have to ask his wife probably on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| The last week I doubt she's seen much of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| But I think the four plans that you have before you with the deductibles and all is a really good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1035)|
| 0:17:25| My concern is that we're going to be getting this, I mean, almost as we sit down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1045)|
| 0:17:33| it seems like, whether to vote this up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Is that what I'm not hearing, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| It's a very, very short time frame, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| So, I want to make sure that the employees are satisfied with if this committee comes in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1060)|
| 0:17:49| and says it's company X instead of company Y or Z, that they're going to be fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1069)|
| 0:17:59| Of course, Commissioner Lutho, we can't tell you right now what company it might be because the bids have gone out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| But if it's the policy is the policy, then, I mean, are we going to have objections to a certain company or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1086)|
| 0:18:19| We addressed this with the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| And John and the rest of the committee members can back this up because there was a set of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| I think we started with nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| Was that correct, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Those questions have now been expanded to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| That those people who are submitting the bid have to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| And those questions solely came from the new committee members where we had spoken with our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1117)|
| 0:18:45| and we brought their concerns before Matt, John, and Hugh and the rest of the original committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| and we said this is what the employees are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| So, we've got those in forms of questions on this bid for those providers to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| I think one point to add, too, is that it's going into a self-insured plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| This is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| These are Knox County's plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| And so Knox County makes the benefit choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Knox County makes the rate choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| And, you know, we are asking to hire an administrator to pay claims according to that plan or those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1153)|
| 0:19:22| Answering these 15 questions that you said you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| You have them, I think, with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1167)|
| 0:19:27| Yeah, but my question is, how will that be brought into the evaluation process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| I mean, is that going to be that second part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| There are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| There are some questions that deal strictly with the provider network, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| So, they could influence how they score on these evaluations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| Answering the questions, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Any answer no, and you all correct me, because we covered this, I think, about every day we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Any provider that answers no to one of those 15 questions is automatically out of the, they are not considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| The words may, the words may in there, I don't want to mislead anyone, may be disqualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Tim, why are you up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Just one more question, if you don't mind, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| John, when we're looking at wellness centers, how come we're not considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| because we've got several locations at the health department, one out on Old Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| We've got them throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| How come we're not looking at those as possible wellness center locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| We looked at the different locations of where employees were and tried to be as central as we could be, and that was just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1243)|
| 0:20:54| Is there not some way to incorporate the concept of a wellness center with our health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1254)|
| 0:21:01| One of the concerns that we had, and I think that's a great idea, but we had concerns with privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| and we wanted to build as high a wall as we could between what we as a county do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| and what the employees are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| This is going to be a third-party provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| We don't know who goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| We don't know any diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| We don't know any treatment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| And we pay the company to keep it secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| And so that way our employees through the health department don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| Our health department people are fine professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| but we just didn't even want to have any appearance that we might share information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| Tim, why you're still up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Some of the people I've talked to, employees, seem not to be in favor of a wellness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| And I think some of them had in their minds that it was a workout center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1307)|
| 0:21:55| So did the committee discuss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| We discussed at length the wellness center and several employees both in, I think, my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| and several of the other offices represented spoke of they would prefer a fitness center and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| When we discussed it yesterday, it is my understanding that this committee, the new appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1331)|
| 0:22:20| and this committee with the insurance evaluation, our only charge from you all as from commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| was solely for us to come up with an insurance plan that we were not to deal with the wellness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| And that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| I guess maybe, thank you, Tim, maybe to Troy or Matt, someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| the employees who, I guess, told HR they wanted a wellness center, is that what they really wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| Or are you hearing that now they're saying they thought it was a fitness center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| To me, as a financial person, the wellness center, the primary purpose is to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| I mean, we have to spend some money to save some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| And it's also a benefit to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| I look at it as a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| It's another treatment option that's available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| They can use it or not use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| It's their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| And I think it's a win for the employees if we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| It is a separate agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| And so the county commission considered that separately, separate bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| But I think the wellness center is going to be the future, especially going into a self-insured program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| Our claims are our cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| And anything that we do to keep our claims down or keep our people healthy are going to save the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| and save the employees money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| I guess, would the employees go and have to have some kind of information that they let this company keep track of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| Or is it if I get a code instead of going to the doctor and getting a script, just walking over there and get a script?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| And do you have to have an appointment or can you just show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Yeah, it would be by appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| And that's part of the reason we wanted to start small is that we wanted to make sure that they were busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| And then if they were busy, then that's a good problem to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| And we can consider expanding at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| And so, yes, prescriptions would be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| And it would be a still need to make an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| But the primary purpose of it is to get the people who have heart disease, diabetes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1458)|
| 0:24:27| and other long-term illnesses and to make sure that they continue their treatment options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| so that they keep our long-term costs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| And so I feel like this is an investment in our employees' health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| and this is an investment in long-term savings for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| I just want to remind everybody that's a 500-plus item on this in the health insurance plan somewhere down through the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1486)|
| 0:24:57| We have bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| The bids are being evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| So there's no recommendation yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| But we expect one very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| And I've got a couple more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| The other question is I've tried to keep up with it as they've been meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| I think the reserve will have probably less than 300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| I'm happy to talk about that, glad to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Thanks for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Yeah, we're going into a self-insured program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| And so our expectations are that we're going to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| We're going to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| We're not going to pay a 1.75 percent premium tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| We're not going to pay a 1 percent broker fee right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| And those are good things about self-insured program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| Self-insured, though, one of the things that we understand, and it's a risk, is that the county is taking more risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| I think it's well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| I think it's a good risk and a smart risk to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| I understand the city is going to do the same step or recommending to do the same step this year also to go self-insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| But your claims are some months high, some months low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| And we understand that, and that's just part of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| In the long term, we expect to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| On a self-insured program, over a 10-year time frame, we would expect seven years to be a savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| and three years to be a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| And overall, it would be a savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| How is the first year going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Going into this, we have $300,000, round numbers, in reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| It would be nice to have three months' worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| We did consider asking the county commission for a temporary loan to the employee benefits fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| I mean, it's loaning money to ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| It's going to all stay within the trustee just to have that buffer in case we get a bad month or two to start off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| And I think that's probably a good idea and a fair recommendation to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| But the way that we've priced this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| and I've been over this with our data and our historical experience and our actuary help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| that it's priced to break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| We haven't priced to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| We haven't priced to lose money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| But this is just what we expect it to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| And so over the course of a year, we're going to start with $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| With everything that we know, I expect it to be in the year with $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| But we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| I mean, claims vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| You can't plan on being sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| You can't plan on having accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Another part or piece to this puzzle that we can consider is we're going to have another budget coming up very, very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| And I think this commission could provide for some reserves in next year's budget as just part of the overall budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1650)|
| 0:27:39| So there's a couple different options for the full commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| And, yeah, I concur with the committee that we'd like to have some reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Yes, we need to build them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| But we don't need to, you know, have it all on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| What would be three months' premiums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| That's about $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| It's about $1.5 million a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| So we should have $4 million, $4.5 million, and we're going to start out with $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| And that's probably whatever you all want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| But what if we have claims that reach into the million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| I mean, where are you getting the extra money from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| If you get claims that are $700,000, $800,000, we've got $300,000 for the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| One of the recommendations is a stop loss policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| And what that means is that any claim over $250,000 that we would have reinsurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| and so the county is only liable for the first $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| That's per employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| I'm saying what if we get a bunch of employees who spend a lot of money on their insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| or at doctors or hospitals and we run over to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| Would you come back to county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| We can do it several different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| I'd be glad to come back to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| We can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| I'm happy to report to the county commission, you know, here's how we did the first month, second month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| third month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| We could do the loan as a temporary, you know, temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| I think the loan is probably a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| And, you know, we're going to be six months into this and then we'll have a new budget in place, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| And I think that would be an appropriate time to build in some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| You as the chief financial officer of this county, are you going to tell us that this is a financial sound decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1765)|
| 0:29:34| We've built the rights to break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| So I think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| I think, you know, we heard from the employees, don't have the rates any higher than what you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| And we tried to build the rates that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| We didn't build the rates to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| I think let's give it some experience and we'll see if we can build the reserves over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| I think it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| I've got one more question and I'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Looking at the, like, the consumer plan, if you look at the deductibles across the silver and the gold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1800)|
| 0:30:10| and then you come down here and look at them in the proposed plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| the deductibles went down from like $20,000 to $9,600 on the family max plan, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1815)|
| 0:30:30| And across the board, they look like they've come down considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Yeah, that's one of the concerns that we heard from the employee groups and we responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| The maximum out-of-pocket expense is people ask the question, okay, if I'm covered under this insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| and I have a major medical catastrophe, what's the most that I can be charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| What's the most I'm going to be out-of-pocket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| And we heard from the employee groups that, yeah, that was just too high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| and that was just too much to ask the employees to give, and so we lowered those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| And it's more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| It's more expensive to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| It's more expensive to the employees, especially over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| But we listened to the suggestions, and so that was one of the biggest differences we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Just looking at these deductibles being lowered, this puts more on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1884)|
| 0:31:35| And yet the employees and the county are going to be spending the same amount of dollars as you told us here last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1895)|
| 0:31:47| Mr. Chairman, what are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| I'm just trying to follow where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| I don't know where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| I'm looking at page 15 in the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1913)|
| 0:32:04| And then I had this from our --I had this from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1924)|
| 0:32:14| It's on the second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| It's on the second page, they're telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| This shows the employee cost and county cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| But do you understand what my question is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| That if our deductibles are going down considerably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| and the county is paying the same amount and the employees are going to be paying the same amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| then how are we coming today with this better plan than what you all came to us last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| I'm glad you asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| We've spent quite a bit of time going through our data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| and we have since had further more recent information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| And so that's part of what the committee charged me with is what's the best deal we can do for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| and the employees and I kept pushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| I kept pushing hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| And that's part of the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Some of the bids came in better than what we had earlier expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| We had a different distribution than what I expected earlier on the plan choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| But what if we'd approved this last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| If we'd approved what you brought to us to the commission last month, then we'd approve this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| And then now you're telling us that you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| The county would have saved money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| I mean, this plan will cost the county more money without a doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| We think it's better benefits and we think the employees are worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| I'm glad that you asked us to, you know, hear from the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| We heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| We made a change and we've done the best we can on the rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| I'm a little slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| I'm happy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| I'm from Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| I'm a little slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| You know, I'm trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| If we'd have passed this last month and we'd had our employees having a deductible of possibly $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| and they're going to be paying the same amount now, and maybe they're only going to be out $9,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| If we'd have passed this last month and say you knew what the plan, I mean, you had the bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| so and we're going to be paying the same amount for this plan now, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| I don't understand where we made ground at if everybody's paying the same amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| and at the end of the day it's close to a $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Some of the bid pieces came in better than what we had expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| And also, you know, part of it is just an incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| You look at that maximum out-of-pocket amount and you say, well, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| if it's $9,600 out of network and $4,800 in network, I'm going to make sure I go in network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| Yeah, but would you have come back to the commission and told employees, look, things have come back in better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| or since these things were already going out to employees, they would have been paying a $20,000 deductible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| Who would have been making the difference in the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Would we have made it back to the county and kept the savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Or would we have passed it back to the employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| It's my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| And we're in the market where health insurance costs are going up 10% to 15% a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| And our tax roll is going up about 3% to 4% a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| And so health costs are getting away from us in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Assuming that we're at the same tax rate, this is getting way, way ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| And anything that we save is great and helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| And everything that we plan to save, if we happen to have a good year, what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| We're going to turn around and hope we can continue to provide similar benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| But when costs are going up this much, this is really getting expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| And let me just share, in case people don't know, we do have a separate employee benefits fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| And that's exactly how we would finance this, is that we would take premiums from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| and from the employees, and we deposit all that into the employee benefits fund, which is with the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| All the money is with the Knox County trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| And then the third-party administrator pays the claims, and we pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| We pay the third-party administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| And so if there's any money left over, it's all on deposit with the trustee, all dedicated for future employee benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2171)|
| 0:36:19| which I think, if you look into the future, expenses are going to be very, very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| And everything we save is going to be spent very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| I don't know if I got my question answered, but let me see if I can help answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| The one we had before had a lot more whistles and bells to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| We had a lot more smoker discounts and stuff that we took a lot of things out of it that aren't in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| I thought the smoker discount was coming back to the employees either in some kind of a credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| Yes, the smoking discount is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| The non-smoker is still in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| So we're trying to figure out, Larry, what was the difference in this plan and the plans that are coming now forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| out of this committee that seem to be a lot different in deductibles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| I mean, almost in one plan over $10,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| And we're going to be paying the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| And everything is still intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| So I'm not in the insurance business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| So how did we make up that much ground and it doesn't cost employees anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| and it's not costing Knox County taxpayers anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Did we have that wellness center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Was that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| It's not in this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| It's still in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Everything is still in except things are going down considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| But the employees are going to be paying the same and the county is paying the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| And at the end of the day, the total amount is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| So from last month to this month, where did you make up the ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| Or were they just a lot of money left on the table on the first plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2271)|
| 0:38:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Nick's sharing with me and it's very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| The stop loss came in at less than what we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| And there was a couple other pieces that were less expensive than what we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| And I also went back and further examined the data several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| We went back and back and back to piece together the best that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| And so, yeah, we don't expect many instances where somebody hits their maximum annual out-of-pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| especially out-of-network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| People are going to be driven to the network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| and that's exactly what we want to do is we want people to stay in the network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| where we can get the best discounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Because if the employee gets a discount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| that means the county gets a discount also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| And that's one of what we're trying to accomplish is that the employee has an incentive to stay well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| and get the best deal and then the county's interest is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| And so that's exactly what we're trying to line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Well, I think everybody's worked hard and I appreciate everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| But, you know, in my mind, when we go to county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| and they're coming to us and we approved, if we'd approved this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| on what you people told us, whoever it was putting it together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| and now we've come up with a better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| I mean, we need to be informed because we're going to be making decisions on employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| and they come back and see that we were going to charge them $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| and now it's $9,600 on a possible deduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| We hope there's not many instances of that because we want people to stay in network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Yeah, but you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| I mean, insurance isn't, people don't use it unless they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| If you get sick and something really happens bad to you, I mean, you can be out of $20,000 probably fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| And I just think the employees are looking at us to make sure we make sound decisions based on the knowledge that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2385)|
| 0:39:53| And now we find out that, you know, it looks like we're coming in with maybe a better plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| and it doesn't cost us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| So I don't know, and not saying nothing about the committee that worked on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| but they worked on it six or seven months and now we've got a committee that went back for a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| and came back with a lot of different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| I think this is something we should celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| I think we are celebrating it, but if we'd approved it last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| and then the employees would have come out and found out something to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| and then started saying, why didn't you all know this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| But I'll leave it at that because I think council has a workshop in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| So, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| I have just a quick question about the bids and provider networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| That's one of the key evaluation criteria, provider networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| Often new employees find it difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| They get a long list of providers, but none of them are accepting new patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| I'm just wondering, do the bids reflect numbers or percentages of providers accepting new patients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2458)|
| 0:41:12| The RFP that was done last time did take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| This bid doesn't ask the specific question, but I am asking for their provider network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2477)|
| 0:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| What your network is in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| So they should be giving me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| So you will have some data about how many of the providers are actually taking new patients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| Based on zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| And presumably that information also can be provided to the employees whenever the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| whatever plan is agreed upon is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| I just want to make sure that that aspect was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| It seems, and this is primarily to Matt, it seemed like the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| the two major criticisms of the process as it existed in the last meeting, one was the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2523)|
| 0:42:12| It sounds like you've made peace with the employees pretty well, right, Tim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| and the folks that were involved in the input there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| And then the other major criticism seemed like was involved scoring criteria on your evaluation sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2541)|
| 0:42:29| Did you all change any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| And could you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Sure, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| The scoring on the last RFP, somebody please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| I think had five different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| And procurement code plainly states that when you do a request for a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| price is never the major component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Prices can always be considered, but it's never the major component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| Doing an invitation for bid, which is what we have a draft of, price is the major component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2571)|
| 0:43:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Yeah, yeah, I'm looking at the same numbers Scott's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| I think you guys have done a great job bidding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| One question I have is about the wellness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| Will the wellness center be distributing narcotics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| and is there anything that we can do to limit the amount of narcotics that they can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| There will be none in the wellness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| There will be none in the wellness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| I mean, they need to go to their regular physician if they need something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| I think you guys have done a great job, and, Tim, thank you, and thank all the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| One question on the reserve, the $300,000 or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| If this goes into effect on January 1st, then when we did up money from the employees' paycheck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2632)|
| 0:44:05| does that not go into the fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| So on the first paycheck, we'll put another $750,000 in that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| On the next two weeks, another $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| I'm trying to get back to Scott to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| About as soon as we start this, we're going to get a chunk of money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| So the $300,000, if I'm not mistaken, will be supplemented $750,000 every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| So that might ease up the potential loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| Well, I think my point, what I was wanting to talk about is the wellness center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| because some of the employees thought it, the way they're talking to me is they thought it was a fitness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| So if we've got $300,000 and what if next year we're upside down, we spent a lot more than we took in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2684)|
| 0:44:53| either the employees are going to have to pay for it or the taxpayers are going to have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| So the wellness center may be a great idea, but starting a self-funded plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| would it not maybe be more financially responsible to not have the wellness center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2704)|
| 0:45:12| and go ahead and put the $515,000 or $415,000, whatever it's going to be, into the reserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2712)|
| 0:45:19| and that way we'd start out with $700,000, $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| I appreciate you're talking about reserves because I love to keep reserves as a financial person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| I think that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| But my concern with the wellness center is that, again, it's about preventing costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| and keeping our costs low and addressing the 20 percent of the people who cause 80 percent of our costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| And I think in the long term, if we're going into a self-insured program, we need to look at long-term savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| and I think that would be a short-term savings that would have a long-term cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| And I think the sooner we can get into it, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Last year when we had a proposal, one of the vendors cut their price by more than the cost of the wellness center just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| they knew it was a fully insured product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| They knew it would cost them less money if we had the wellness center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| and they're ready to put their money where their mouth was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| And this is going to be a separate agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Maybe by commission can you maybe get us what the wellness center really does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| and maybe explain to us who it's going to affect and, you know, exactly how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| I think the evaluation team is nearly done, and so we can have a specific vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| and specific proposal that, you know, the full commission can consider, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Have you gotten data from the insurance companies over the last year of what the payout has been versus premiums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| Yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Can you share that with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| How have we done in the last year in terms of what we've paid in and what claims have been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| You know, I don't have that right in front of me, but, you know, we've.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| We've paid in more than we've taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| Would that be a fair assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| I think they're really, really close is what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| But I will share some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| I have some numbers back up in the office and be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| And I think on an ongoing basis, being self-insured, that's numbers that all the commissioners are going to want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| on a very regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| I was going to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| You had mentioned monthly reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| It might be good while we get into this is to have a monthly report to see where we are in terms of premiums coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| and expenses going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Yeah, because our expectation, some months are up, some months are down, and you just need to know and be able to track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Also, there was some concern by at least one of the companies that the process was flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| Is there any way that we could ask the companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| or is it proper to ask the companies when they present their bids at that time if they feel the process has been flawed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| rather than when the bid is awarded, then all of a sudden they're saying it was flawed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| Can we, I mean, I'm sure that the same concerns would be when they present the bids as opposed to when the bids come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| Commissioner Hammond, there is a clause in the bid document that basically asks that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| if you have any problems with these specifications, if they appear to be ambiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| or too restrictive, please contact the purchasing division representative, which is Matt, 72 hours prior to the opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| So if you don't get any, then we can assume that everybody feels that the process was fair, that it's being followed properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| And, John, is like the flexible benefit administration, is that part of this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| There's a separate bid, but, yes, it is our proposal and that's a separate agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| I think it was deferred last month for consideration for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| But what we propose is that we propose a company that we had a, I think it was a three-year contract with a company called C&J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2929)|
| 0:48:58| Consulting who did our flexible benefit, our 125 plan that had a card that you could have your unreimbursed medical expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2938)|
| 0:49:08| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| And what we asked for is we asked for that 125 plan administration plus health reimbursement account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| plus the health savings account to be all on one card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| And that would be a separate item for this commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| But, yes, it is considered with the rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| And, yes, we are proposing that the county pay for that benefit for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Do you know how many employees use that right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| Out of how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Our HR department can tell you and we'll make a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| It's gone up every single year substantially, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| Because if you take the wellness center and then all that, you're probably somewhere around a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2981)|
| 0:49:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| I mean, you're, you know, as far as the flexible benefit administration, that's taking away a benefit from the employees too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=2991)|
| 0:50:01| Is that something we have in place now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| It's a different provider and their contract expired and we put it out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Do we have, do we run it in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| I mean, we have the contract with the company, but does somebody administer it here in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| We pay them to administer it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| And that includes the administration of the claims and the tax compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| So no county employees mess with any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| I mean, they work with HR to sign people up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| They work with the trustee's office as far as the payment of the claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| And they work through payroll because we take deposits that people make into their unreimbursed medical accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| We take those deposits out of their paycheck and deposit it with the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| And then the trustee's office works with them to pay claims as people have expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| You know, they meet their copay or they want to use their card for their prescription.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Does anybody have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3059)|
| 0:51:10| Commissioner, before we're done, I just want to thank the committee one more time behind me for all their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| They've really put in a lot of hours over the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| It's been a very short time frame for them, and I appreciate their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| I think all of us want to thank the committee for working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| And, Matt, I appreciate you bringing in these new members to the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| and working with them and listening to their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| And we'll be dealing with, I guess, the wellness center and the flexible benefits in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| It sits on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Yeah, we have three different agenda items that relate to this, and that's the administrative services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| the wellness center, and the flexible benefits are three different agenda items, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| If we don't have any other questions, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004special?start=3119)|
