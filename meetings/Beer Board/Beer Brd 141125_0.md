| 0:00:40| I don't see any Boy Scouts, so apparently they're coming to council. When I call the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=40)|

| 0:01:14| missing something in the process, need to bring that documentation to the business office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| during business hours when it's finished. And beer board members, once again, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=79)|

| 0:03:11| They've called because they have a distance issue, and they're applying for a TABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=191)|
| 0:03:19| and as we all know, that doesn't happen yesterday, and so they have asked that we defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| to the December 18th meeting. Do I have a motion? Second. All those in favor? Aye. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=203)|

| 0:05:42| A, whether he wants to have alcohol, and B, whether to go the TABC route. And so until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=342)|
| 0:05:51| he makes that decision, he's asked us to defer this. And the January meeting is on January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=351)|

| 0:06:29| district, so I move to approve pending final documentation. Second. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| Aye. All right, thank you. Another tree. Los Fuentes Mexican Restaurant and Market. I checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=394)|

| 0:07:10| one with the exact same, you know, requirements. Right. So I want to move that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| and approve it pending final documentation. Is there a second? Is there a reason to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| defer it until the next meeting? Well, I mean, you know, their file is complete. All they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| have to do is get the permit turned in. Yeah, I'll second it. We actually put this off last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| month. Yeah, we did. Were they here last month? Yeah. They were here last month. Right. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| forget what they had not done. I think it may have been background check. I'm not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve pending final documentation, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| would be the former owner's permit. All those in favor? Aye. Opposed? Okay, thank you. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=476)|
| 0:08:04| right. We have an addendum, and we'll do that and then come back and see if these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=484)|
| 0:08:13| came in. The Flo Brube Parlor on Main Street, this is in Councilman Brown's district, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=493)|
| 0:08:21| it? Yes, sir. Hi, Brad Peer, 3636 Tallaluna Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=501)|
| 0:08:31| Sergeant Hunter, this was deferred, but they're good, aren't they? I believe so, since they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=511)|
| 0:08:39| were approved. Okay. Is the file complete on this now? It's not. Okay. What's the game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| plan here? Game plan is I received a promise of certificate of occupancy today. It's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| the mail. Okay. I would imagine that they would communicate with your department. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| received fire department approval yesterday. Okay. My question is, do you require health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| department approval as well? No health department. Ms. Dyer? No, the health department is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=541)|
| 0:09:11| dependent upon that. The beer permit is not dependent upon health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| We have the certificate of occupancy in fire department. Yes. Okay. What we could do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| approve pending final documentation. When you have those things in your hand, go see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| Ms. Dyer and she'll give you the permit and you can start pouring beer. Great. Do I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| a motion? So moved. Second. Pending final documentation. Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Tell us a little bit about this Flo Brube Parlor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=577)|
| 0:09:44| Well we're doing specialty coffee on Main Street. We're bringing coffee to an area that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| really underserved right now. Okay. And then we're doing an elevated but small beer program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| Okay. So we're doing one of the oldest breweries in the UK and we're doing glassware appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| pours at a great price. Okay. And when... Elevated being higher alcohol? What? Is elevated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| meaning higher alcohol? No, the presentation is elevated as opposed to pouring from a tap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| and throwing it down the bar. We're taking some care and attention to how it's poured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| and the glass it's poured in based on the style of beer. You have to hold your pinky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| up. You might. Okay. It might go down better. So once you get these permits all straightened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| out, when do you expect to start? I would like to open December 1 on Monday. Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| Well I hope that you get all the things taken care of. The city will be closed on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| and Friday. Okay. So you just need to see Ms. Dyer on Monday I guess if you've got everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| in hand. Okay. Ms. Palmer. Yes. Is it extended? We've approved pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=640)|
| 0:10:47| so when those permits come to you, he can have the permit. I mean when the approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| inspections and things are finished. Were we asking for an extension? No. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| what the addendum... I'm sorry. I don't mean to dispute you. I just want to know how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| want me to report back to the board. The addendum is asking for an extension. He was already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| approved subject to final documentation, right? Well we're still... then we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| need to do anything because he's approved and he's explained now that final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| is on its way. Is that correct? It'd be okay to go ahead and extend it. I mean obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| he's right on the cusp of doing it. And if he gets it then it's finished? If he gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| it he doesn't need to come back. Okay. Do you want to change your motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| pending final documentation or extend it? I guess extend it. Well I'll move to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| it. Okay. Is there a second to extend it one month, December 18th? Sure. Alright. All those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| in favor? Aye. Okay. So if you get everything by Monday, see Ms. Day and you'll be in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| If not, please have it by December the 18th. Okay. Alright. Thank you. And I believe Los| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| Fuentes is here. And Los Fuentes? Lost? I don't know if you want to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=722)|
| 0:12:11| Thought we just approved? Yeah, we did. No, I'd like to at least hear from them. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| it'd make this board a little more comfortable with this if we at least heard from them since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| they're here. Ladies and Madam Chair. Okay, thank you. That way we're not setting a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=742)|

| 0:13:21| documentation. We just didn't know we had to bring it. Okay, that's fine. Okay, by December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| the 18th, before the next meeting, you need to make sure you surrender that to the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| tax office where you took your application so that they can issue you the permit assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141125?start=813)|
