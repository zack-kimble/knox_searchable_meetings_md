| 0:14:55| The traffic study, I think it warranted a signal in the peak, or like the AM peak or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| the peak hour warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=900)|

| 0:15:09| So TDOT, you know, I think Dominion was hoping to install the signal, but TDOT, being the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| state highway, and they ultimately make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=916)|

| 0:16:56| Mr. Snowden, is this portion of Asheville Highway controlled by TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Can they require him and right turn in, left turn out, or turn in, turn out, or would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1027)|
| 0:17:16| I've had some early on conversations with the traffic office, and obviously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| those conversations bear out differently, but when I recently talked to TDOT, they said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| that they would not allow left in, so this access would most likely be restricted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| a right in, right out because of the median along Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| So, you're looking for 100 and, say, 20, 25 dwelling units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Yeah, the spacing of the medians and getting the turn lanes and all the tapers in, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| some, I guess, concern that TDOT had with allowing that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| So, if 120 units have to all make a right turn, then where the next break in the median| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1077)|
| 0:18:05| is, is that still DOT or is that Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Essentially, the next upstream or downstream median openings would serve as U-turns, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| TDOT obviously, you know, that's what they would require these folks to do, which the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| road would accommodate that from its width and radiuses, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| So, you're comfortable with that, with that setup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1110)|

| 0:21:30| I don't have nothing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1290)|

| 0:22:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Now, please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| I disagree with the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1330)|

| 0:22:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Is that all you wish to say at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Mr. Wonderman, if you step forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| You have five minutes to address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Thank you, Madam Chair, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| You're representing several in the neighborhood who cannot be here today, but we want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| you to reconsider the rezoning here that's been recommended by staff and by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:52| This two-acre parcel is surrounded by single-family homes that are all zoned at one dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1372)|
| 0:23:01| per acre, and so we disagree strongly with the idea that it is consistent with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| I want to state that we have no issue with development, certainly, and we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| that there is a housing crunch in Knoxville, and we would welcome appropriately zoned houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1395)|
| 0:23:23| for this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| We're talking about a two-acre lot that runs up a hill that has a hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| of course, and so this would be a significantly compacted, clustered area in between a culvert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1411)|
| 0:23:41| a drainage culvert, where all of the water drains from the neighborhood adjacent to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| and a hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| And so it would make a significant impact upon the houses that it abuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1428)|
| 0:23:55| This lot was originally intended for a single home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| It is surrounded on all adjoining sides by existing homes that have one dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| per acre zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| I want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| I don't think that anybody expects for someone to come along and put two dwelling unit per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| acre houses or townhomes directly in an existing 25-year-old plus neighborhood where the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1456)|
| 0:24:27| all existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| This neighborhood was entirely built out before the individual who purchased this lot purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| And it was one dwelling unit per acre at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| I want to say that this property was purchased that way and the neighbors who all purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| their houses all believed this to be one dwelling unit per acre property behind them when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| bought their homes in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| The property wasn't surrounded by open land or by a farm that has been, that the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| has changed over time, but rather all of this has existed without change in a fully developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| All of this, we believe, would constitute spot rezoning of a single lot which has always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| been correctly zoned as one dwelling unit per acre due to the surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| and the very challenging topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| We believe these units would be pressed in between the drainage culvert in the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| and the hillside, causing a significant impact to the surrounding houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| The rezoning of this narrow parcel would likely result in accommodating four townhomes clustered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| on a small portion of the lot perpendicular to the street, which is also inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| with the neighborhood that it's being plopped right in the middle of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| While townhomes at this density were approved one half mile down the road, and we understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| again, the need for housing in Hardin Valley, significant things were taken into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| with that that cannot be taken into account here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| For example, peripheral setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| This lot is far too narrow for any of those kinds of accommodations that were made on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| the other property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| There are no, there's no room for appropriate buffers between multifamily structuring and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| existing houses, and the narrow frontage in Hardin Valley Road would also allow for single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| access of the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| In other words, there's one driveway to access these units, and in order to put a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| and dwelling units on this tiny little piece of property, you would have to clear cut an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| entire property, and it would adjoin our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| I might add to that that obviously, as we all know, the incredible busy Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| Road, that several other developments exit right on to, right where this property would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1612)|
| 0:27:01| have to access its location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| And then finally, I recognize that you're under the certain constraints, but we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| ask that if you are going to approve, despite all of these things, that you, we respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1630)|
| 0:27:17| request that conditions be added, maintaining mature trees and adding evergreens at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| property line, as well as a drainage study before any clearing is done and a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| plan is approved, at the very least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| Commissioners, do you have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1659)|
| 0:27:47| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Sir, I've just got a question, and I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| You said you disagree with the planning recommendation of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| You agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| I'm sorry, I thought I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| So, you asked, you originally applied for one unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| And then, okay, so the planning commission said two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| I thought I heard you say you disagree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Are there any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1696)|
| 0:28:24| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| I'd like to hear your take on this, because that might alleviate some of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| This is, I recognize looking at this that it's two acres, and that seems like a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| I will tell you, though, everything that the opposition said about it is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| It slants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| There's very, very little, even close to level, and then it goes straight up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| There is setback that would be required from the road because of the retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1738)|
| 0:29:07| If you look at the map pulled up, on the whole length to the right, I guess that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1747)|
| 0:29:16| the east, in the subdivision where I believe Mr. Waterman lives, there are actually four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| homes that stretch the full length of that lot, or the full length of the two-acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| so you can see how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| Do you have any estimate how much of that two-acre lot is actually buildable, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1777)|
| 0:29:45| I think like 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| With the setbacks that you're required to have, including from the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| I think it's somewhere around at least an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| I know I spoke with the civil engineer, and he said whatever we had to do for the storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| water, that all the water that's there, we will not bring no more water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| It will be the same water that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1807)|
| 0:30:21| In the end, I know we're only talking about the difference between two lots and four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| but I have to say Hardin Valley Road is already full of homes and townhomes along that stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1828)|
| 0:30:42| and there's going to be other significant parcels that will be coming up in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| that will be many, many, many new homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| I really do stand with the neighbors on this particular one, even though it's only difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1853)|
| 0:31:02| of two houses, because it truly would be four little townhomes stuck in the middle of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| we have very little of left in Hardin Valley, which is some spacing along our major corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1871)|
| 0:31:22| I will tell you that that's my heart speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1882)|
| 0:31:32| Having said that, I'd like to make the recommendation that we do not approve the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1892)|
| 0:31:44| of planning commission, and we keep this parcel at one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1904)|

| 0:32:05| Would they have access to Hardin Valley Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| You'd make them come out there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| They couldn't get up that hill on the backside, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| They would go through Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1932)|

| 0:32:28| I think they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| That hill is a monster hill on the backside of that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Yeah, it looks like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| I know that neighborhood well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| There was a little sliver there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| I thought he might could get to the right of way, but he can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| Yeah, so his only public road access is Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| Yeah, I was trying to understand, because I was confused, because the lots all to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| right are quarter acre lots, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1963)|

| 0:33:08| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Mr. Walderman, isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Because on here, it's showing that they're quarter acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| What is the size of the lots that you're on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Well, they're different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2000)|

| 0:33:34| To the right of them are, unless I'm reading this wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| Yeah, Commissioner Ward, there's a couple of them down at the front that look like they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| between three-tenths and four-tenths of an acre, so there's a couple down there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2022)|

| 0:33:46| A little bit smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Yeah, so that's, because those are the only ones, because, I mean, this thing goes like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| vertical-vertical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2032)|

| 0:33:55| Is there any other discussion before we have the vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2035)|
| 0:34:04| All right, we have a motion and a second on the floor at one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2044)|

| 0:34:15| You'll have to stand at the one per acre, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2060)|

| 0:36:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Mr. Snowden, with the, are we doing road improvements in front of there right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2162)|
| 0:36:14| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| If you go out there right now, it's kind of a mess, just to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| We're raising the grade right through here quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| So yeah, there's a lot of feel being placed here that hopefully, I was talking to Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| Chair Hill about it, what we hope to have done by the school, time school starts in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| a couple of weeks, is what the contractor's told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| In front of this property, then, would there be a median?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| There is a median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| So much like the Asheville Highway conversation, this gentleman's access will be restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| to ride in, ride out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| But thankfully, once again, much like Asheville Highway, this is a wide median, so that median| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| width allows for the allowance for U-turns up and downstream as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| And we're talking about 40-something units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| Approximately, yes, 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| 43 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| And no, just ride in, ride out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| And how's that traffic flow going to go under those circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| I mean, I think it would, we don't foresee that with these number of units that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| would be a challenge, necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| I mean, we would permit it and don't feel like it would present an issue that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| revise the access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| And then everything around there is single-family residential, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| For the most part, I don't, yeah, I don't think, there's no commercial in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| other than just, I think there's some across the street near the ball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| But nothing that high density at 12 units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| There is some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Well, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Madam Chair, if I could say, I think it was about two years ago, we, further up near the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2284)|
| 0:38:13| Grassy Creek development, right across from Amherst area, just, I mean, I think just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| the north of it, we, I think we approved something similar, do you remember that, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2299)|

| 0:38:37| This is some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| I mean, it's just the whole corridor, I mean, obviously is going to experience growth, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| I think we had a big discussion about what would Chod look, you know, Chod Road capacity-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| look like, but I can't remember exactly the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| And currently it's five dwelling units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Are there any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2342)|
| 0:39:11| Well, it falls to me, and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2351)|
| 0:39:23| You do recognize that you have a little over half an acre of that that's eliminated from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| the total density, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| What is your plan for that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| So the plan was to put, towards the back of the property, anywhere from 12 to 15 attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| townhomes, and then closer towards the front, we were going to do a single apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| that would have, you know, probably 30 units, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| We want to try to, I don't know if it's the right word, undisturb as much of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| as possible, because it's a beautiful piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| There's some beautiful trees on there that, I mean, they look like they go back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| I mean, they're fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| And so we're going to preserve those in every way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| And if we just asphalt the whole thing, and if we don't stack some apartments, the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| thing is going to be asphalt and concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| And so we're trying to not do that by putting some townhomes in the back, and then up towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| where the entrance is, putting, like I said, if we can stack some apartments, two, three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| high, that'd be all that there would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| I mean, the trees to the right, if you're standing at the street, I mean, there's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2436)|
| 0:40:45| The reason I bought the property, I walked on and I just stood and looked underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| I know it may sound silly, but if you saw these trees, you would understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| They literally are, I mean, they look like something out of a Tom Hanks movie in Savannah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| Georgia, the Forrest Gump or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| I mean, they're just beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| So we have every intent of preserving those trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| Much of the rest of the property, there's not much that's that interesting, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| front right-hand corner, I mean, they're just park-setting trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| I don't know how else to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| But to the left, I think I've got plenty of room to build a single apartment building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| I mean, when I say single, it'd be 12 with another 12 on top and then potentially six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| walkouts below the 24 units so that all of that would be in a 30-unit building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| And then again, in the back, 12 to 15, just depending, I'm working with the surveyor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| see what fits where, but probably in the back, 12 to 15 townhomes, road townhomes, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| So that is my intent, is to not go in there and just concrete and asphalt that whole place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2500)|
| 0:41:48| Commissioner Oster, I'm sorry, were you finished, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| I just have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| And you may be able to answer it or Mr. Snowden, but in the frontage of the property, it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| like it's offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| What is running in front of Ball Camp Pike there that restricts him from going all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| way down to the road surface?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Do you know what I'm talking about, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| I'm familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| When we did our stream determinations many years ago, TDEC identified that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| stream in that vicinity, so we had to buy that area and do some stream mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2541)|
| 0:42:28| I think we did a little relocation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| So we had to secure that property to ensure that our relocation of that stream got maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| So from the road surface to the property line, is that like 50 feet, 25 feet, 100 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| Probably wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| We bought 50 feet off-center as our standard right-of-way, and in that situation, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| even wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| So it's probably more than 50 feet from the center of the road, from the center of existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| So that's just protected area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| It was for stream relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Director Snowden, will EPW be able to grant the median opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2588)|
| 0:43:22| It wouldn't fall within the standards we would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| We have, once again, to get into the spacing and whether or not it's urban and rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| So we would think that a median cut here might create more trouble for traffic than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2610)|
| 0:43:38| keeping the median there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| I think if it, I can't remember the exact spacing there, but we would not, I mean, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| certainly look at it and address it through the concept plan, but our initial impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| would be that we wouldn't allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| And Mr. Harvey, thank you for keeping the trees growing up out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| I appreciate that not everything being concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| Is there any other questions before I, Director Brooks, I noticed in our comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2644)|
| 0:44:13| that this is labeled suburban mixed residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| And when I'm looking at the land use mix in this, it says residential single family, townhome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2661)|
| 0:44:32| attached, and then secondary would be civic or commercial, but housing mix, duplex, multiplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2672)|
| 0:44:42| and townhomes that have a scale of a single family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| So I'm not hearing that even in the new plan that an apartment building fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2688)|
| 0:44:58| Am I misinterpreting this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| No, Commissioner, I don't think that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| That's something that we would, if this was to be approved, we would want to have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| discussions with the applicant about what their plans look like in advance of submitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| So we would evaluate this as a development plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| But if you look further down, form attributes, building form, one to three stories, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| is typically what we see in single family neighborhoods currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| So yes, the idea is that these are, of course, they can be smaller lots, but it needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| be kept in the context of smaller scale and single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2735)|
| 0:45:43| There are some images there to give some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| Yes, I see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| So there are small scale multiplexes that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| So do I have your assurance that if we were to approve this at 12 per acre, that the apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2760)|
| 0:46:09| design even would be more compatible with a single or townhome area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2769)|
| 0:46:22| Did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| No, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| My plan on the construction for the apartment building would be when you see the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| it's two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| It would be behind where there would be a walkout basement below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| So if you've got 12 units, another 12, and then in the back, you would have six, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| those six would be walkout, that'd give you 30 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| And you wouldn't even, I mean, I suppose you could see them, but they're in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| You know, the front, you're only, some of these, I haven't seen any of that that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| So I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| We own an apartment complex that is that from the front, it's two stories, and then there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| a walkout in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| So when you're in the backyard, you see three stories, but when you drive by, you see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| two-story apartment building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| A lot of the stuff they're building now, I mean, they're throwing up stuff three and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| four stories high, and it wouldn't look like that from the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| If you come on the property and look at the back, I suppose you'd see it, but from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| front, it's going to look like a two-story apartment building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| And the only other case I'll make is I can do all townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| I can fill it up with all townhomes and not have any apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| I can do that just fine, and if I get reduced, that's fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| But the footprint, you're going to have a lot more concrete and asphalt because I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| got to dig more footers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| If I'm able to do 12 with another 12 on top, then they're all under the same footers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| But if I have to spread them out more, then there's just—and that's why I love that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| property because I've got a lot of room around these trees, but if I'm limited on units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| those trees are in the way because I need to justify the cost of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| And so instead of doing some in the back and some over here, it's going to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| a big U-shape or you've just got town—it'll look like all townhomes because there'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| all townhomes, but it's going to be a big, giant thing of asphalt with townhomes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| surround it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| And we've all seen those, and they look fine, but it's a lot of—it's just a lot of concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| and asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| And I really—I'd put it in writing, if you required me to keep the trees, I'd keep them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| and there's no debate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| I'd love to keep these big trees up front, but again, if I'm stuck just with the single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| families, it's just—there's just not as much—I mean, you understand what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| I do understand, and that really is exactly what we are trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| It's just at this point—and I'm not saying up or down, but at this point, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2925)|
| 0:48:55| we then have to put a lot of faith in your, I guess, concept that what you—you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2935)|
| 0:49:03| what you accept after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| So I do hear you saying that your intention is to stick with these definitions that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| have been given for our future land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| And I spoke with my surveyor today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| It's Rusty at Land Development Solutions, and he literally is working on that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| and there's townhomes in the back, and I told him he can't cut my trees down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| I mean, that was literally a conversation I had the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| I'll provide the site plan as soon as it's prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| He's working on it now, and I mean, if we did that, we'd be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| I mean, I have no—I have no desire to knock—if I wanted to just buy a piece of land that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| didn't have—I can't recreate 100-year-old trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| Yeah, I understand what you're saying, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| I can do blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| I can do bricks and asphalt, but I can't make a tree that looks like it's from the Civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| I don't want to take those down in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| And the only way to do that is an apartment building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| Director Brooks, what I was saying, this is, in fact, your intention moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=2998)|
| 0:50:06| I know it's your intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| I'm just trusting that you will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Yes, and we would encourage you to—to the applicant to reach out in advance, even before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| you submit, if you have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| It's a new plan, and we'd be happy to meet with the applicant in advance of actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| submitting to the Planning Commission for additional review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| I think we're having two different conversations here, but for clarification reasons, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3029)|
| 0:50:37| it's PR, apartment buildings are not allowed in PR, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| Townhomes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Duplex, triplex, quads, I think, are, but an actual apartment building is not, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| a height restriction as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Yes, there is a height restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| I wouldn't say that apartments are not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Yeah, that's what the gray area that we're discussing now is, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| So help me out and give me a better definition of what PR currently you're able to do within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| the PR zone, and what the height restriction is for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| Okay, I'm going to pull it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| So the following uses are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| So houses, attached houses, duplexes, multi-dwelling structures and developments are allowed, accessory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3076)|
| 0:51:25| uses, and then we're not talking about commercial in this instance, but you can do commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| if the property is large enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| And then if you go down to area regulations, it talks about setbacks and peripheral boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| What's the height restriction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Height restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| I want to say it's like 30 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| 35, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| But let me, I just, I'll double check here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Sorry, I can't scroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3113)|
| 0:52:06| It doesn't limit it by, it says houses and duplexes shall not exceed three stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| So that does align with the place type that it's currently assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| Commissioner, are you finished, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3136)|
| 0:52:26| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| Director Brooks, the site is four acres, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| And currently he could build 20 homes on there right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| Yes, with his five dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| Okay, so 20 homes, and if we go to 12 units an acre, he could build 48 homes, right, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3171)|
| 0:52:59| it's approved tonight, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| No, not that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| I think we, approximately 43 for the entire lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| Because there's a little piece back there that's disqualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| There's a piece that's not part of this, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Okay, so it's not really 44 total acres then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Yes, there's a portion of it that that has been excluded from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| And I guess my only comment is, I think Mr. Harvey's intentions are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| The only problem that we have on this body is, is if we approve this at 12 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| an acre, tomorrow somebody can approach him and clear cut that land and build whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3216)|
| 0:53:44| they want to do, and there's no guarantees, and that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| When we do a rezoning, there's statements are made that are not tied to the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| And so, something to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| This is very near ball camp school too, and I have a, I do have a little bit of problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3240)|
| 0:54:11| with traffics already down there, ball camp in Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3251)|
| 0:54:27| I will regret, Mr. Harvey, that you and I did not personally speak about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3267)|
| 0:54:35| Quite honestly, when I looked at it, I wasn't at all bought in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| Did I hear you say that you already have a site plan and do you have a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3282)|
| 0:54:50| a concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| The engineer is working on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| We're trying to meet the deadline, which is in two weeks, to submit the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| Deadline for who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Is that not, I mean, the deadline that is in two weeks to get to the September meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3300)|
| 0:55:09| for the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| I don't know what that's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| I just know that I've got to have the site plan submitted by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| Yes, I believe you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| I have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Yeah, it's two weeks from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| I've got to get the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Some of my engineers are working on getting the site plan prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| And if I may make one comment about the traffic, you are 100% correct, but a large portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| of that is because of all of the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| I mean, they're putting in the two lanes on either side and then the emergency lanes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| then, and that, when you drive through there, they're not finished in front of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| and the congestion is just, I mean, it's terrible in front of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| Oh, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| But once that road is fully completed and there's no more trucks in the way and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| that, I mean, it's a, you know, it's a four or five lane highway through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| And I think that, I think the construction will fix the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| I think that's why they're doing the extension is for that very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| And hopefully that's short lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| And Mr. Shoemaker, just if I could address selling it, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3371)|
| 0:56:19| I could sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| And again, it's just, it's just us talking because there's nothing in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| I have no intention of selling this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| I mean, I could get hit by a bus and my wife could sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| Outside of that, I want to develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| I don't have any desire to flip it, to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| I've bought other properties in the past and I've been offered double what I paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| to flip out of it and I still own them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| I'm not in the flipping business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| I don't intend to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| And I know that's the guarantee is just my word and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| But I have absolutely no intention of flipping this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| It's just, it's such a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| It's a great, I mean, ball camp, the parks across the street, the schools right down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| There's an intersection that gets you to Pellissippi Interstate very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| It's just a great, great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| Just bring, I guess, a little context to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| I do think your word matters, quite frankly, because I think that matters to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| And I think that we are, as a body, we're constantly asking, almost demanding good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| development, smart development, good developers, people that want to preserve the land and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| density on corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| We have put millions of dollars into Schott Road and we've had this discussion before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| and we're going to have it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| We built it for density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| And if you don't want more sprawl in the outer parts of the county, this is an example of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| how we should support people who want to put density on corridors next to schools, next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| to shopping, on major infrastructure so that it doesn't continue to sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| And I just feel like, you know, those things should take priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| That's what we've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| And I know we'll have this discussion for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| But I think this is a great opportunity to show that we're getting good developers, smart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| developers, people that are conserving the land and focusing in the right areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| So I'm happy to support it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| Are there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| I would like to ask our law director a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| Being an attorney, legal issues do matter to me and I appreciate your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| I just wanted to know, as a legal issue, if he deviates from this project, what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| county's recourse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Well, first of all, anything he's – this is a request for PR, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3545)|
| 0:59:16| So anything he does will have to go to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| It will have to be approved as part of the development plan and the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| And if he deviates from it, litigation could ensue based on the representations he made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3566)|
| 0:59:35| to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| But, you know, the truth is – and one of the reasons why it's maybe not the best idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3578)|
| 0:59:48| to talk about what's planned on a property is because, as Commissioner Schoonmaker has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| said, once you rezone it, it can be used for any purpose that you've rezoned it for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| that's now legal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| And so, really, when we consider the rezonings, we need to be considering, in my humble opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3602)|
| 1:00:10| is this an appropriate zoning for this area, regardless of what use the person who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| seeking to rezone it to says he has for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| So, right now, do you have a way to claw it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| I mean, if you found out before next month that everything that was told to you was not true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| you could potentially move to reconsider your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| But much past that, there isn't much to do, at least under our rules as they stand currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3635)|
| 1:00:45| I've had another piece of property raised – a commissioner raised a question with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| me about another piece of property, but it was rezoned back in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| And if we were to try to downzone it now, undoubtedly litigation would ensue, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| don't know if we'd win that case or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| It's hard to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| But when you focus on the zone itself, and is this zone appropriate in this area, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3666)|
| 1:01:15| focus less on what does the person seeking the rezoning intend to do with it, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| probably come up with decisions that will be more in line with planning principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| rather than – we're going more and more sort of an ad hoc, well, we'll give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| this zone if this is what you're going to do with it kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| Which we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| So the answer is not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| We do have the misrepresenting yourself in front of the commission, I suppose you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| go after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| Really, I think the best thing is just to look at the property, determine is this an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| appropriate zone for this property, regardless of what we're being told the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| Is it appropriate for this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| And then that's a decision that you won't get caught up in these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| Well, he's telling us, and nobody's casting aspersions on you, it's a question that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| goes – but he's telling us he's going to do X, Y, and Z, so I'm going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| for it based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| Well, if you just look at the appropriateness of the zoning for the community, for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| property itself, regardless of what anybody's telling you, then you're not going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| that problem as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| So I think the problem arises that we're placing too much emphasis on what the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| is telling us they want to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| When the fact is, again, as Commissioner Schoonmaker said, once you rezone it, anything can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| So that's just how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| That's why it's a little dangerous to be inquiring too deeply into what the intended use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Sir, I'd like your – oh, if I could respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Sir, I appreciate your coming in here and talking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| I'm just having an issue with that of being non-favorable to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3789)|
| 1:03:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| May I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| It's been pointed out at the beginning of the meeting, we failed to swear all the witnesses in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| We missed that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| So at least for the foregoing, if I could have everybody who's currently addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| and planning to address this commission stand and raise your right hand on any matter that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| remains on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| You solemnly swear or affirm the testimony you're going to give tonight will be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3825)|

| 1:03:53| Commissioner Jay, and then I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Just a really quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| I'm glad Director Moyers pointed out the sort of overall concept and the strategy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| where we are, of thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| If we care about advanced NOx, which we just spent two years on and millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3848)|
| 1:04:16| and we all sat here and said, this is our vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| This fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| If we want to deny this, then we might as well have thrown away advanced NOx for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| This is kind of a perfect example of we said, this is exactly what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| Now let's just follow the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| Let's execute what we've done as a body and say, great, move forward and find a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| I just think this ties so directly to what we just all endorsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| I can't say why we wouldn't approve it and say good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3884)|

| 1:05:20| I'm prepared to go ahead and make a motion that we approve PR up to 12 per acre, recognizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3920)|
| 1:05:31| that you have the .64 acre in the back, that it is not included in that, coming to a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3931)|
| 1:05:44| of no more than 43 units for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=3944)|

| 1:07:55| Director Brooks, what is the recommendation for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| the PR plan residential zone up to three dwellings per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| because it's consistent with the Knox County Comprehensive Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| and surrounding development, subject to the two conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| noted in the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4091)|

| 1:08:25| Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4105)|

| 1:08:33| Again, here on behalf of the applicant property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| under Thunder Mountain Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| requesting County Commission to rezone the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| to plan residential up to three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| as recommended by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| This property is located within the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| under the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| The current new land use designation for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| is traditional neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| and then a portion of it does have a land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| of town center mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| The traditional neighborhood, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| is the majority of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| These areas feature a mix of housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| ranging from single family to town homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| and some small multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| The town center is more appropriate for a larger site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| for large and compact walkable developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| including commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| They have a similar housing mix of multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| attached residential, such as duplex, multiplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| and town homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| This property, prior to the adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| of the new comprehensive land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| was designated as LDR, low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| under the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| And as you all recall, at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| for a planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| that would allow up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4189)|
| 1:09:59| We recognize that this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| although it is a large size tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| there are some site constraints with hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| and the access to the property from the public right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4209)|
| 1:10:17| These conditions will obviously impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| the overall resulting development that will come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| and be recognized or realized once engineering work begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| and we submit for development plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| Again, at this time, it's difficult to entirely say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| what's appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| what makes sense to be developed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| when you factor in, as I said, the hillside, the access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| and in applying the other plans applicable in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| So in trying to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| what is the overall potential resulting density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| I'm not talking about necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| what could you possibly build here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| I'm talking about what actually makes sense to build here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| And when you consider the available housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| of townhouses, single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| and some smaller scale multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| it would be short-sighted to limit the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| to less than three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| coming just with an arbitrary speculative type analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| here at the rezoning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Again, that's something that's going to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| detailed engineering, design, meeting with planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| Knox County engineering to work through all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| Obviously, with hillside, we support the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| that staff recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| that planning commission imposed on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| But as you're all aware, with hillside, with development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| it easily or commonly becomes cost prohibitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| to develop in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| That is the benefit of the plan residential zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| is the clustering to provide that optional method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| of land development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| Again, we ask that you adopt the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| recommendation of plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| up to three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| subject to the two conditions that were imposed thereon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| Opposition now has five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| Hi again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| So the planning staff recommended two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| It's, you know, the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| We're pretty comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| We're not really comfortable with three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| They're not going to build on the whole hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| They're going to cluster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| And in our community, again, we're on the edge of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| and we're going to start doing this kind of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| It just doesn't make a lot of sense to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| We're also concerned with Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| We don't really feel like a turn lane is going to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| You know, if they do three per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| that's probably 3,000 trips a day on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| and you're going to cross over that highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| there's no light there, there's no anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| This is really a dangerous situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| and the turn lane is just a bandage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| on, you know, what the issue is here with this kind of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| You know, we're very respectful of the owners of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| but, you know, we're concerned with how that's going to look up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| on that hillside also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| This is a very rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| We also, as a community, don't feel like we're being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| We're not consulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| You know, there's zero outreach from the developer to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| You know, it's a surprise to us that they're donating land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| You know, they're proposing moving the ball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| We kind of want to look at all of it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| So we really feel like we should slow this process down a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| give the community a little bit more room in here to negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| with the developers, do a few more studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| You know, we're looking to hire a vehicular engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| to see what the impact is, not just of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| but of all eight projects that have recently actually been built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| are in the process, or have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| You know, you're looking at probably around 1,100 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| with just a new little turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| It doesn't really seem like it's sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| And we have real genuine concerns about the land that was donated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| Again, we're grateful for the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| but there's been no assurances given to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| that an actual ball field can be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| And they're also moving this ball field from an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| where the noise pollution doesn't really matter, it's on the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| into the middle of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| You know, noise from the ball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| I mean, there's some things to consider here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| You know, these are impacting people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| And so we want to just kind of slow the process down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| do a few more things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| I think hiring an outside engineer to see if we actually can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| that ball field in this very swampy area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| And there's also, you know, Legacy Parks is involved with this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| but they're not raising funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| there's no money given to the ballpark over the next five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| in the county's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| You know, we don't want to give zoning, you know, grant zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| you know, turning things into commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| without the new ballpark having some certainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| that it's actually going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| These are all issues together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| We're taking a little tiny slice of the pie and looking at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| We want to look at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| We want to have our voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| We are actually pretty smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| If we come up with really good solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| it was actually our idea to move the ballpark over there a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| So we're not a no to things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| You know, we've also have told Legacy, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| we thought they were going to be kind of in charge of developing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| You know, we're glad to lend our expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| We're landscapers, you know, siting things, having it be beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| You know, we're not a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| We really are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| A lot of people say that, but we really mean it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| But we're not involved in this process at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| And there seems to be a hostility from our own county commissioner, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| but, you know, we don't feel represented by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| You're clearly advocating for these developers and not advocating for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| We're your voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| Kim isn't here tonight, you know, to vote for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| We don't want this vote to happen tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| So we're respectfully asking for a delay to look at more of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| the traffic issues, all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| Just, were you going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| I was going to defer my time to Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| Oh, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| So I think I had 1.30, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| So let me try to get through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| And I appreciate some of the stuff that Ms. Close said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| We have been in meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| I've actually been in one or two with her personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| One of the things that we're seeking to do is we agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| we need to do a master plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| We've got a ball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| We've got a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| We've got some acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| We've got some potential commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| We've got everything you need on Chapman Highway at an intersection with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| Sevierville Park that will allow us to develop this with some walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| and some really neat things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| However, we need some certainty in what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| Are we looking at five units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Are we looking at 1,000 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| We don't know 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| So we do want to do a master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| And that master plan process and that planning process is part of what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| come back to the planning commission folks that we start answering stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| like traffic and where are our buffers and what makes more sense for access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| and all those kind of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| But this is a legitimately really nice spot on Chapman Highway to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| several pieces of property with park property, new park property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| to make something that's really special for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| But, again, we have to have certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| Am I looking at this number, this number, or this number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| And it's hard to come up with a master plan if you're trying to put all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| together and come up with 14 different master plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| So we would ask for that's why we're wanting to move forward is to get as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| much certainty as we can as quick as possible so we can approach the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| community with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| And we did meet last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| For clarification before we start discussion, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| there's been several different things kind of mentioned as the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4770)|
| 1:19:38| was speaking about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| This property that we are addressing at this point in time has nothing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4782)|
| 1:19:50| do with the ball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| That portion of the property was considered during the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| Commission meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| I appreciate your comments, Ms. Kloves and Mr. Forrester and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4803)|
| 1:20:14| Campbell, on the idea of looking at a master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| I think that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| And in the big picture, we need to look at that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| But right now, we're just able to make a decision on this immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| piece of property that's right here in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| So having just said that for clarification, is there any discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Is any of this 103 acres part of what we took action on several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4845)|
| 1:20:53| ago for the same applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| That was on the, and I'm probably messing up the direction here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| south of Chapman, across Chapman from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| So we've never discussed this 103 acres previously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| Have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| And then what will the access be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| I believe that goes back to the development plan considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Our goal would be to come off of Chapman Highway for a majority of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| We do have Evans on one side, and there would have to be road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| improvements if we go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Evans connects to Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| But our hope here is, again, we can put all that together and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| that access off of Chapman Highway kind of a universal access for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| lot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| And who would be responsible for the road improvements to Evans Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| As always, it's the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| I mean, everyone I've been involved with, the developers had to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| come up with paying for whatever those improvements are, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| I think that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| I see you're live, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Are there any other immediate comments before we turn the floor over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| Take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| I apologize, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| You weren't showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| Taylor, what about, has anyone talked to the people of Sandra LLC with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| regards to this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| I received the letter, a copy of the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| I've not had anybody reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Have you had anybody reach out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Just the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| I know what Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| I heard what Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| Close was saying as far as the neighborhood has not had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| But I wanted to clarify that I think Sandra might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| I talked to Mike today from Sandra LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| He said he has not had a meeting and he was under the impression that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| this was not going to come up to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| So that's why he's not here to represent himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| But also in his letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| he asked that no improvement shall encroach within 500 feet of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| property of 8710 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| So I don't know how you all feel about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| I mean, I'd say 500 feet is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| You know, when you consider how the property is laid out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| So my client, one of the members of Thunder Mountain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| his mother actually owns the property in front of the Sandra LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| But how that property wraps around there, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| these are things that once you have a development plan studied and design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| laid out, it is a lot easier to have those discussions because you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| what you're working with in the sense of, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| here's where the portion of the housing will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| This whole area is not going to be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| I suspect this property kind of gets laid out in different facets like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| But, you know, as a 500-foot buffer at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| it just seems premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| I'm not saying it's not possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| but I would say on some of the portion up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| as it ties towards Chapman around that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| I think that's pretty flat land and this would be a residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| So I think 500 just at this time would be something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| hard to agree to just at the limiting factor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| I hate they're not here and they haven't been spoken to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| but after talking to them, I think there's room for negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| So I'm hoping that you all will contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| they have attorney too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| I saw from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| I can definitely reach out to him and connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| Yeah, I just want to make sure that that's important because they are a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| small minority woman-owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| So we want to make sure we keep them lifted up as development goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| just to make sure everybody has the opportunity to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| I'll definitely connect with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Mr. Forrester, what at this time are you guys prepared for your boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5122)|
| 1:25:29| your landscape buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| You know, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| I know it's hard because you've got to do your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| With the rezoning and not typically, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| considering those without having engineering involved for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| the design of a development plan, I would say on the back boundary line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| I guess, of that Sandra LLC property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| it's a pretty significant slope back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| And, you know, I think as long as, you know, along that back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| I think 100 feet of a buffer, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| and have that determined on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| Like I said, it is very steep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| significant hillside on the rear of their property where our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| adjoins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| But, you know, there is kind of a straight line across there that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| you know, at least along that boundary there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| Because our typical, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| our typical for residential is around 35 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| I mean, we can condition it higher, but that's about standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| We have three different landscape screening guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| We have the type A, which is 15 feet in width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| and then type B, 12 feet in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| So typically that would be a little large, so 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| So we're getting a little bit better than what we would be getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| typically with them offering 100 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| Thank you, Mr. Forster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| I know that this is a huge project for this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| and it's always scary when that kind of stuff happens in a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| It's kind of been off by itself for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| and so I know that that's emotional for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| But it is hard for the developers to know what they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| and what they can't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| and then start working with the constituents until they have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| development plan so they know what their number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| And so that's always frustrating, I think, for the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| And so it kind of puts us in that situation of we know we've got to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| them something so they can get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| And there have been meetings, Mr. Forster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| with the community, and so obviously I'm a huge community meeting person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| So once you guys get your development plan, if you'll just work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| I'll make sure you get back with the community and have another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5277)|
| 1:28:07| Ms. Close, are you stating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| did I hear you state that there's been no meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5297)|
| 1:28:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| One more statement before I turn this over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| If I may, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| Oh, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| If you don't mind, I'd just like to take a moment of personal privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| and that is that as county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| we all know we have a very difficult job when it comes to zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| and we're never going to make the public and the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| happy 100% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| And I just wanted to say that I've known Commissioner Daly now for eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| years serving on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| and his character is unquestionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| And I've also had the opportunity to serve with him on the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| Zoning Appeals for six years prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| So he does an outstanding job of representing the folks in the ninth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5354)|
| 1:29:22| district, and just because you disagree with him on a zoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| doesn't mean that you didn't have representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| because that man does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| And that's one of the reasons that he received an award for being the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| outstanding county commissioner in East Tennessee recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| So I just want to take that opportunity for personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| I have a question for probably Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5389)|
| 1:29:56| I know that one of the reasons that the staff recommended two per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| was because the slope analysis only supports the two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| As their engineer, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Again, the staff's analysis is done based on average slopes and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| acreage that comes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| And so one of the things that we always like to do from the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| side is we prefer to have just a little bit more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| I'm not sure that we can get to three, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| But I would hate to get to 2.5 or 2.4 and not be able to get there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| And, again, understand until we have good surveys of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| we don't 100% know where those areas can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| So we may have a 50-foot strip or 100-foot more of this property that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| can develop that we don't know now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| We've not, again, done field surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| We don't have good technical data on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Again, the planning staff does a great job with GIS data that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| in a lot of cases, accurate, but it's not the most accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| So we don't want to take ourselves from a situation where we could get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| few more or we could make things a little bit better and we're limiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| ourselves with this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| When we come up with a development plan, the number is going to be the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| I mean, it's how much the land will take and how much economically we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| develop, how we can tie all that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| So probably a long-winded answer to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| but we would prefer that we have a little bit more to work with than have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| to try to keep coming back to the table asking for that 10 or 15 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| whatever that number is as we go through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| Commissioner, are you all right to continue to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Just wanted to make a statement in agreement with Commissioner Schoomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| I appreciate the Thunder Mountain people coming out here, but I will say I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| haven't always agreed with Commissioner Daley, but I will say he does do his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| homework and he does represent his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| So it is tough sitting up here because we're not going to make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| I do care about what the community thinks, and I think every commissioner up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| here, Mr. Daley doesn't have much longer to be on this, but I will vouch for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5541)|

| 1:32:41| You know, this has been a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| This all started over three years ago on the first one, and I first want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5564)|
| 1:32:52| thank Thunder Mountain, Chris Arnold, who's the grandson of Mr. Ben Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| It's not about Mr. Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| It's about the family legacy and the generation of children getting to play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| sports in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| But tonight we're talking only about one thing, and that's possible rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| of this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| Next month will be another rezoning, so we'll talk about that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| Tonight is just about this 103 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| I agree with Mr. – you know, I've spoken with Mr. Campbell and Taylor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| There has to be a major plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| They own the land across the road, Chapman City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| They own the land between Highland View and Simpson Road and the lower –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5619)|
| 1:33:46| excuse me – the land across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| Well, part of this master plan is they own both sides of Highland View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| We can – you know, the traffic study and Mr. – I think I've spoken to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| Snowden about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| Highland View can be rerouted to the top of the hill, intersect with Evans Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| and we can put a red light there on top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| We don't need – right now we don't need a red light at Highland View because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| you're topping a hill and having to stop at a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| This could be part of the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| We've got to get a master plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5658)|
| 1:34:25| It was mentioned something about the Capital Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| This was started three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| I was taken on top of the hill by Mr. Arnold, and he asked me at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5672)|
| 1:34:39| if the county would be interested in a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| I thought it was 115 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| It turned out to be 107, probably the biggest land donation in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| that I know of anyway, and you could knock me over with a feather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| Well, at that time, that was – if you all remember back, it was rezoning of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5696)|
| 1:35:03| At that time, it was the pristine farmland, and it is beautiful land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| but it wasn't swamp land at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| Now, since we've got 20 acres, and that 20 acres, that is beautiful land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5711)|
| 1:35:18| It's going to be a beautiful park, artificial fields, no more rain outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| We're going to have football, soccer, pickleball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| You name it, we're going to have it on this new Bower sports complex or park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5725)|
| 1:35:33| It's going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Mayor Jacobs assured that it would be, and I believe Mayor Jacobs' word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5735)|
| 1:35:46| The letter that Commissioner Lundy just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| Mr. Campbell, if I'm not mistaken, that's 12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| Six acres of it belongs to not Thunder Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| The six acres that butts the ladies' property belongs to a different individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| So she's asking – this person is asking for a 500-foot buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| on somebody's property that's not even owned by Thunder Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| Thunder Mountain does not own that six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| They own the property – the ladies' property on top of the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| six acres that's not owned by Thunder Mountain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| then you've got Thunder Mountain property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| So we cannot put a restriction on somebody else's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| that's not part of Thunder Mountain's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| but we will – I guarantee you they will meet with the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| and try to do the buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| Yes, there's been meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Taylor, how many meetings have you attended with Kim Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| Commissioner Frazier, and Mr. Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| Mr. Campbell's been to more than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| I've been to one where Commissioner Frazier did ask to meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| I guess that was towards the end of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| but I know Mr. Campbell and the members of Thunder Mountain property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| Chris Arnold, Mike Malakote, met with Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| I know Ms. Close – I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| Jim, were you – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| Last week or the end of the week before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| It was either last week or the week before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| and had a lengthy meeting about this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| the other projects or rezonings in effect as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| But there have been several meetings because, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| this thing started three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| and I know there's been countless meetings there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| or meetings at Bauer Field with commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| and community residents throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Mr. Forster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| Commissioner Oster, yes, there's been neighborhood meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| and there will be more neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| because this is going to be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| the master plan will have to have the input of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| The master plan for the sports part will be community-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| It has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| There's no other way that it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| As Mr. Campbell had just said previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| that three per acre, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| We could approve five per acre tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| but it's the slope that's what's going to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| Even if we would approve five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| if the slope analysis comes back and says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| you cannot disturb this part of the mountain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| you can't disturb it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| That number is going to be what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Mr. Campbell and Mr. Forster are asking for three per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| because they don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| It may be 2.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| It may be 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| They don't know that until all that study has got together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| So that's why they're asking for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| I doubt seriously that any development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| that I know of in the last eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| that we have approved for, say, up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| they've ever maxed out up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| It's always usually a little lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| They just don't max out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| That's just the way the things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| I don't see that three with a slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| it's not going to be a three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| There's just no way it's going to be a three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| I did talk to Mr. Arnold and Mr. Malico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| They want to tie in trails from, say, down Evans Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| around White School Road, down Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| They want to tie in trails that will lead to the new ballpark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| to the new complex and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| I will say this about Mr. Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| He is the grandson of Mr. Ben Bowers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| and he wants to see as much of his property saved as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| He don't want to go in and cut trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| He don't want to go tear everything down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| He wants to put in trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| He wants to put in the amenities that will help this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| and there's nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6003)|

| 1:40:11| We spent, like Commissioner Jay said, two years and a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| and this fits advanced NOx perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6016)|

| 1:40:50| So I know I don't make many people happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6050)|
| 1:40:59| but I can promise you this, that whatever is decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| it's best for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6064)|

| 1:41:13| It is on the growth area where advanced NOx says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6073)|
| 1:41:18| this is where you need multi-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6078)|

| 1:41:42| So my motion is going to be to recommend approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| per planning recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| and that includes the two conditions that are on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| and especially the most important one is the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| They cannot exceed the slope analysis, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6120)|

| 1:42:23| and the two conditions already noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6143)|
| 1:42:31| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6151)|

| 1:43:19| Seeing no opposition, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| would you read the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6203)|

| 1:43:36| Briefly, this property, the total property is 155.71 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6216)|
| 1:43:42| The rezoning request, though, is only for about 86 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| which is north of Stock Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| That part of the property north of Stock Creek is in the planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| It was in the planned growth area during the old growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| that was adopted in 2021, and it remains in the planned growth area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| The back 70 acres, which is south of Stock Creek, has significant hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| We're going to be placing that into a conservation easement and looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| develop the front portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| It's relatively flat, although there are multiple streams and potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| karst issues that we'll need to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| But we're asking for a planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| which is partially related in the rural conservation land use map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| which is what has been applied to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| because that allows us to cluster the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| Fifty percent of the development will still have to remain kind of open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| under that rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6275)|

| 1:44:40| We have had a traffic impact analysis done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| We know we're going to have to redo the intersection between Tipton Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6282)|
| 1:44:49| Road and West Martin Mule Pike, and that's going to have to be realigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6289)|
| 1:44:59| or even potentially a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| We know we're going to have to work when we move forward with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| development plan with Director Snowden and his group as to what exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| needs to be done there, but that intersection does need to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| Tipton Station, though, there has been a recent traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| done by the county, I believe at Commissioner Daley's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| and it does have capacity with its existing width for the traffic that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| will be placing on the road with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| There's zoning surrounding this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| There's an adjacent RA zoning right next to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| which allows consideration for densities up to 4.35 dwelling units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| acre as 10,000 square foot minimum lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| It's about 1,700 feet from property that has a density of five dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| It wasn't developed out of five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| so it's the conversation we had just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| You ask for the density, then you can decide what you really need once you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| get the engineering in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| Zoning has progressively been moving in this area kind of west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| It started around Bonnie Kate Elementary and South Doyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| We expect development to be concentrated there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| but it is moving in this direction, which is what you would expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| because this is an area that is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| It's an area that we've identified as planned growth with the advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| NOx, that this area is somewhere where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| with these traffic improvements that we're able to participate in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| we'll accommodate this type of density and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| We're willing to, again, it's a rural conservation place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| which does require us to cluster our development and preserve open space in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| the development itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| There's some residential property around there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| and to kind of keep a peripheral boundary around that and kind of have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| non-disturbance zone, or if we do have to disturb it because of grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| replant that so we can kind of keep a buffer around the peripheral of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| property, which in the planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| there's a 35-foot peripheral, no build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| You can reduce that to 15 if it's adjacent to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| so we're thinking a 15-foot buffer would be appropriate for something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| But, you know, we know we need the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| We know we just, it's been said many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6432)|

| 1:47:21| to limit sprawl and to put development in areas where it can handle it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| and this is such an area, based upon the growth policy plan and based upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6446)|

| 1:47:36| that we'll have to implement at the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| So we would ask that you approve this per Planning Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| Commissioners, do you have any comments before I turn this over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| Let me go ahead and comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| Maybe they'll have some questions after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| I won't make a motion until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| Thank you, Chair, for letting me have that privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| Mr. Mullins had sent you all an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| Everybody got that email last week about agreeing to the intersection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6489)|
| 1:48:18| Mark Mill and Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| You should have had that last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| If not, we'll send it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| Also, there was another, some more information from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| I don't know if I sent it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| I did send it to Drew about the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| Mr. Snowden, our conversations that we had with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6513)|
| 1:48:40| we cannot contractually make him do this at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| It's the Smith-Davis rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6530)|
| 1:48:51| So, but we do understand, did you get to have a conversation with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| Barrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| Did you get to have that conversation about they will be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| 100% for the intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| As part of the development plan concept plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| our department certainly wants to make sure that any impacts negatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| that are associated with this development are mitigated by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| If that traffic study does identify that as a problematic area, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| we will require them to make improvements to mitigate their traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| Well, I'm asking that improvements be made anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| even if the traffic study doesn't come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| That intersection does need, it's at that angle where it's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| And I know people don't like roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| We could pull up a traffic history there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| We'll probably see that there's been several cars run off in that curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| They need to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| They're not going to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| It needs to be a roundabout to make them slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| I don't know if that would work or not, but that's in the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| And I think that would be very useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| You're right, that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| It's terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| We have requests for guardrail there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| Intersection, you know, you've got Goddard Road comes in there too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| so it's very, it's just an unusual layout that a roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| I think, would be the best fit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| Well, we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| Mr. Mullins, is that agreeable on record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| My client shook his head yes, so I will go on record and say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| Next, and don't move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| We talked, you and I discussed about the peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| We agreed on a 35-foot setback and a 15-foot non-disturbance zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6641)|
| 1:50:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| I think what we wanted, if we, in having to do the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| if we have to grade into that area, for one reason or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| we would replant that 15-foot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| But, yes, that's what we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| And we know that, and I know that it's not there at the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| That's not going to, the entrance is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| But the property owners on the east side, which is very, very wooded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| of course you cannot cross the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| You'll have to stay off the creek 50 feet anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| And then on the west side and the north side, there's some mature trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| that that 15-foot non-disturbance buffer, it don't sound like a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| but right now in the green, it hides a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| In the wintertime, it might not, but that 15-foot means a lot on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| And so you are agreeable to that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| On record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| All right, got you on record, on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| Under oath, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| And the south side, you've already said it, but I'm going to confirm it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| The south side of the creek will be put in a conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| It will never be touched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| And that is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| That's what needs to happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| It would be difficult to develop that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| If somebody did, it would be a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| So, yes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| It could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| They'd have to put a bridge across Stock Creek, but it could be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| and it doesn't need to be developed because I know the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| personally that back there, not in my lifetime will that ever be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6739)|
| 1:52:26| I'll be 65 in September, and I've known them as long as I can remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6746)|
| 1:52:33| that land will stay the way that it is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| So that conservation easement up through there is perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| and hopefully the other people that got the land on above that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| they will do the same thing because it's not really developable on that side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| It is developable, but you've got to have a bridge across Stock Creek to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| and that's very, very expensive to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| So those were the main things that I want to make sure happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6774)|
| 1:53:00| So I wanted to get that out front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| and so anybody else that's got some questions now that they can feel free to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| Mr. Snowden, I understand that that site some time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| was the home of Atlas Powder Company, a dynamite manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6800)|
| 1:53:27| What's the process for determining soil issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6807)|
| 1:53:34| or anything left over from a previous industrial site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| when starting to build people's homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| Ben may be able to speak a little bit about this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| From our perspective, that's something we don't deal with on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| We're just looking for a TDEC notice of coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| so I would assume TDEC would have a pretty robust involvement in that grading permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| because of those potential for soil contaminants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| And we've done initial testing, and we think it won't be an issue with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| but that's something, again, that's ongoing in permitting as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| So TDEC would have to make sure to give you a sign-off on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| Yeah, we only issue a grading permit after TDEC issues a notice of coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| so we're just a subservient agency there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| Ms. Brooks, help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| I was trying to read through the notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| The staff recommended two units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| because it's consistent with our current comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6874)|
| 1:54:41| County Commission, help me understand the two units of acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| versus the four units an acre and the timing and where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| because this is a very rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| and I'm confused as to why it's above and beyond what we've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| for quite some time now, which is two units an acre in a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6896)|
| 1:55:03| Okay, if I understand your question correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| So in this particular place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| up to five dwelling units per acre is considered consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| So the Planning Commission can consider up to five in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| And Planning Commission, I mean Planning Staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| one of our primary concerns when looking at this was the access to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| It's very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| There's just a small section there that actually touches Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| So that was one of our concerns as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| given the size of the property and the development potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| Can you remind me of the access plan, or do you know yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| Well, I mean, we will have one point of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| It only has frontage on Tipton Station Road along one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| And typically when access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| there's no other secondary access anywhere around the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| Typically what happens, we will have a boulevard entrance that will allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| ingress and egress for two different methods to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| And that would be required whether we were developing this at two units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| acre or the four units an acre that we've asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| is that you would have a boulevard entrance to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| if one lane was shut down, the other lane could still function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| And that is something that engineering has approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| Similarly, limited access, properties with limited access like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| And final question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| can you just reiterate the traffic improvements that you've agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6993)|
| 1:56:38| where those are and what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| Yeah, we're looking primarily at the intersection between Martin Mill Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| and Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| You know, it kind of comes down and there's an odd curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| And then Goddard Lane has an intersection into it that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| And it just has some very odd angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| And so we're looking at studying that intersection and redoing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| There might need to be some right-of-way acquired in order to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| But that's something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| our preliminary studies have shown we need to improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7027)|
| 1:57:14| whether that's a roundabout or realignment with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| or however that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| That's something that we'll work through at the development plan phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| Mr. Snowden, is that a candidate for a roundabout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| We believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| It's a unique situation with all those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| anytime you have multiple intersections coming in at unique angles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| roundabouts a way for us to kind of square things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| So, I mean, obviously there'd be detailed geometric design need to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| but we believe that might be a really viable option here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7064)|
| 1:57:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| Mr. Mullins, just a couple of quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| Currently on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| if you're approved for the four dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| you could do approximately 340 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| I knew you was going to ask me math, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| So I looked, I did it before I came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| Yeah, I think, you know, about 340, 343.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| The four units an acre, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| And this is just the developer is just taking a portion of the Schubert family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| property because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| No, we're purchasing all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| But they're recorded as 155 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| and they own the land below the stream, river, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| You're getting that whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| Yes, the back 70 acres, that is south of Stock Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| is what we're putting in the conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| So we've acquired all 155 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| Only the 85 acres is subject to the rezoning and the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| So you're saying the 70 acres will not be a phase two of this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| No, it will be placed in the conservation easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| so it will not be developed in the future in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| And when would that transpire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| When they own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| Are there any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| Rhonda or Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| I just wanted to direct this towards Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| I'm not sure if he asked that question because he didn't know the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| or if he wanted the people listening in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| But based with my experience in developing and building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| EPA and the state would be very concerned about soil testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| So I think that would be an independent test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| So if that lines up, I wouldn't have any issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Madam Chair, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| When we say powder farm, I ran all over that as a little boy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| rabbit hunting, squirrel hunting and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| When we say powder farm, that was the dynamite came from Friendsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7202)|
| 2:00:09| There were block buildings, maybe eight at the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| There are not even that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| Maybe there was four brick buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| They would bring them out there and store the dynamite inside those brick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| buildings, which probably was ten foot by ten foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| not very big buildings at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| There was no manufacturing of dynamite on site at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| It was just the storage facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7231)|
| 2:00:32| Those brick buildings are gone now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| They're not even there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| So thank you for, you know, TDEC will do the inspection and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| but it was not a manufacturing site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| And thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker, for getting that on record again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| That 70 acres will never be touched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| It will be in a conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| So I am going to try to make this motion as much as I can here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7255)|
| 2:01:02| Well, I can't do the first one because the law director will get in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| But I can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7267)|

| 2:03:29| I think this is the first one we've had tonight where staff and planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| and where staff recommendation and Planning Commission have actually lined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7413)|
| 2:03:43| up with the ask of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| So that's a good thing, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| So you're planning, you have the possibility, if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| to go up to 245 homes on this track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| To my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| Thanks, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| Drew, is this the one where you wanted to retain the CA zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| So we inadvertently on our application to planning included the CA portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| to be quote-unquote rezoned in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| We did not mean to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| So we'd prefer for what's currently zoned CA to remain CA and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| behind it be considered for PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| It does, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| And I was going to, I spoke with Mr. Moyers about this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| and it does appear that planning did consider the CA zone as part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| I mean, if there are any other questions, I suppose even if I make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| we could still ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| But this is on the Asheville Highway corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| similar to the one we had earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| Again, this is a four-lane divided highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| This is a mixed-use corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| It is, to coin a phrase here from Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7503)|
| 2:05:09| or to borrow a phrase from Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| this is exactly the kind of element we're looking for in this kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| location because of the infrastructure and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7514)|
| 2:05:19| But because this is a mixed-use and commercial corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| it makes sense to retain the corner of this that's already zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7524)|
| 2:05:30| So my motion then that I'd like to offer is to approve this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7530)|
| 2:05:39| of the ag portion of these parcels to PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7539)|
| 2:05:44| with a density up to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| and to leave the portion that is currently zoned CA as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7547)|
| 2:05:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| We have a motion by Beeler, second by Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| Ward, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| Is there any additional discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7564)|

| 2:07:13| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7633)|

| 2:07:32| and other development in the area, and this was approved on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7652)|

| 2:07:37| Would you like to speak to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| All right, no comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| This is .88 acres, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| Less than an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| Are there any comments before I turn this over to Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7670)|
| 2:07:56| Seeing none, Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| I actually spoke to Mr. Williams regarding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| and he's going to do a fix-up of the current home that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| and then they're going to add one other home for his in-laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7687)|
| 2:08:13| and you already have the driveway in the location, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| And that family is almost all up and down Dutchtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| so they're aware of the flood zone and all that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| so we're good on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| I am completely fine to approve the RA zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| because it is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7710)|

| 2:10:43| I fell in love with that cow field in 87.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| Horses went out in 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7846)|

| 2:10:50| But my heart's in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| And it's hard to give it, but it's time to downsize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| And I can still leave the daughter, maybe relocate me, which I'm almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| ready for assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| And then maybe she can stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| And if not, we can do two pieces and not push her off the property by having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7863)|
| 2:11:08| to do it all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7868)|

| 2:11:18| Because it's got electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7878)|

| 2:11:23| And I put siding after COVID started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| So I've worked on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| I'm still working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| And I do have to pay for the yard maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| And I have to downsize it because, as you see, I'm tilting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7895)|

| 2:11:48| Oh, one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| Two people fussed about the traffic because all the Gibbs School uses the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| traffic, uses that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| But they're not knocking down the mailboxes anymore like they did in 1987| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| every holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| So it's much improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| I just never put one up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| I just used the post office because I kept putting them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| But they stopped all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7927)|

| 2:12:16| And I'll turn this over to Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7939)|

| 2:12:28| And it is a narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| But I don't think you're going to create too much more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240715-zoning?start=7952)|
