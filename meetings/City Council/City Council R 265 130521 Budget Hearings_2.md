| 2:59:59| it went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10799)|
| 3:00:01| 202| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| sometime in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| early to mid-90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10805)|
| 3:00:09| Okay. Which is when I probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| inherited it from Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| Charles handled the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| and did all this out of his private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| practice down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| He didn't give it to Rob, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| The runner would run the documents up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| to the law department and he handled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| And then once the finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10825)|
| 3:00:27| required us to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| requisitioning them when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| became of age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| and had more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| info systems. So that's how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10835)|
| 3:00:37| I got the ordinance and the requisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| And then state law came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| and it got a little more rigid and a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| Councilman Delva. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| I just want to talk about the flip side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| portion of the argument. And that is, I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| been on the receiving end of that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| a community person. And in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10853)|
| 3:00:55| raising money, it's hard sometimes, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| in some of these small neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| and a little incentive to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10859)|
| 3:01:01| that done, a matching fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| They can take that and kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| leverage it and go see the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| Kroger or someone and say, look, I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| $300 from council. If I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10869)|
| 3:01:11| get $300 more, we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| this project done. Those are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| projects that really, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| merit your attention, it seems to me, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| you're not just giving away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| money, you're helping them get a goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10881)|
| 3:01:23| and the collateral benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| is you're building that stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| neighborhood group. So I think that's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| healthy. I do agree with Brenda. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| if it becomes a dependency, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| kind of wrong. We can't fund people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| budgets year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| With regard to the small amounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| what you usually see those come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| is if someone's got a project in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| their district and three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| others pile on to help add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| a little bit of money, but they're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| hold back some money for something they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| got to fund. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| by and large, I think if we pick projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10913)|
| 3:01:55| individually that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| kind of merit the help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10917)|
| 3:01:59| and get something going, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| we do a lot of good with really a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| small amount of money. I mean, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| hate that the procedural part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| is as burdensome as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| and I don't know whether we could look at state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| and see if for grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| under a certain number, $300,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| $500, whatever the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| is, that there'd be less crazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| paperwork. Maybe we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| But we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10941)|
| 3:02:23| can do a lot of good with a small amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10943)|
| 3:02:25| funds. And you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10945)|
| 3:02:27| problems and needs in your district all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| I mean, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10949)|
| 3:02:31| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10951)|
| 3:02:33| Well, we're not in a district, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| I mean, I think it can become a pet peeve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10957)|
| 3:02:39| for me and pet projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| and those may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10961)|
| 3:02:43| have anything to do with the city. It's more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10963)|
| 3:02:45| what I'm interested in and personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| not necessarily, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| helping the city. But I think it's something you need to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10969)|
| 3:02:51| It is a budget item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| It's $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10973)|
| 3:02:55| And, you know, we need to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10975)|
| 3:02:57| about it. But I would stand in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10977)|
| 3:02:59| favor of not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10979)|
| 3:03:01| them at all. But thanks for talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10981)|
| 3:03:03| about it. Vice Mayor, it sounds like a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10983)|
| 3:03:05| Oh, dear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| We just had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10987)|
| 3:03:09| You know, I think that one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| bothers me a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10995)|
| 3:03:17| is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| giving consistently the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=10999)|
| 3:03:21| organization every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| If we're going to continue with it, I'd like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| some type of a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| if you get it this year, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11007)|
| 3:03:29| there's got to be a time frame to where you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| get it for a certain amount of time. That way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| it really is a community fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11015)|
| 3:03:37| and we all could go back...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| Subsistence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| Yeah, you can look at the same organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11021)|
| 3:03:43| And they're great organizations, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| But you all get the same amount of requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11025)|
| 3:03:47| I'm sure, that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11027)|
| 3:03:49| It's a good cause, but I had already committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| to this, so I don't know if we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11031)|
| 3:03:53| with it. Perhaps we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| some type of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| amendment to it to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| you can't get it year to year to year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| So that's just my two cents worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| That sounds like that might be a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11047)|
| 3:04:09| I had my light on to speak about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11049)|
| 3:04:11| something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| I was going to speak on the 202 funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11053)|
| 3:04:15| and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| while I was bringing this up, I actually told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| the mayor, I said, if it's a tight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| budget, if you want to take out the 202| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11061)|
| 3:04:23| funds, no problem with me. I just want you to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| that. That was sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| between me and her, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11067)|
| 3:04:29| I'm sort of torn as well. But the couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| things I'm sensitive to is, one, are the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| members that I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| if they have a different relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11075)|
| 3:04:37| I think with the community groups in their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11077)|
| 3:04:39| and not large members. And so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| sensitive to that and just to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| groups that receive the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| it would be important to get feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| from them. Of course, I guess that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| they're going to say they need the money, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11091)|
| 3:04:53| So that may not be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11093)|
| 3:04:55| if we're leaning towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| doing away with it, it may not be the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| way to do it. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11099)|
| 3:05:01| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| we would hear from a lot of them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| it really is important to their projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| and it is important to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| events and their events are important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11109)|
| 3:05:11| to their organization. That's why I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| continued to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| use the 202 funds. And then I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11115)|
| 3:05:17| last I had a question on the community agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| grants. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| is the process for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| this? Because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| vast majority I think is terrific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| but I was just curious again on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| I can answer that, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| We put out every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| an announcement that we're accepting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| applications for these community grants. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| they all come in to one central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| place. The arts and cultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11143)|
| 3:05:45| ones do go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| we contract with Lisa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| Zenni and the Arts Alliance to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11149)|
| 3:05:51| their own process with independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11151)|
| 3:05:53| people making a judgment and then getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11153)|
| 3:05:55| a recommendation from them. And that gets a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11155)|
| 3:05:57| more arm's length on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| The social service ones do come directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| in and the mayor gets with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| small group of people. It would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| Eddie and I were involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| along with others in the office to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| go through those. And then she makes her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| recommendations based on their scoring. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11171)|
| 3:06:13| some of the same issues that you've discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| with the 202s do come up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| philosophically in consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11177)|
| 3:06:19| of those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| Mayor Brown? Oh, I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11183)|
| 3:06:25| going to go back about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| and I'm not lobbying for it by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11187)|
| 3:06:29| dues for the National League of Cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11189)|
| 3:06:31| but I did attend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11191)|
| 3:06:33| League of Cities meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| this year in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| Washington and I found it to be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| helpful. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| personally, Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| needs a seat at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| table. And that's just my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11205)|
| 3:06:47| humble opinion, but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| wanted to make that statement and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11209)|
| 3:06:51| comment. And I'm not sure about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11211)|
| 3:06:53| is that, are we still a member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| Municipal League? Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| Oh, yeah, yeah. We need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| to, I mean, in my opinion, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| certainly need to be part of the Tennessee Municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11221)|
| 3:07:03| League. That has a lot of impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| on us. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11225)|
| 3:07:07| Well, that was my comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| Now, I just never could find, I mean, I asked a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| different folks who'd been here a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| about the benefit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| the $11,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11235)|
| 3:07:17| dues and it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| wasn't there. And, I mean, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| councils wish to put it back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| so be it. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| it's just you've got to weigh it out. I mean, what's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| newspaper I put in the recycle bin when I get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11247)|
| 3:07:29| I mean, I just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11249)|

| 3:08:13| known fact, that Dan Brown is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11293)|

| 3:09:09| is we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11349)|

| 3:09:13| position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| It is in our purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11355)|

| 3:09:19| of the Minner study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11359)|

| 3:09:37| to kind of address the small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11377)|
| 3:09:39| business concerns. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| is included in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11381)|

| 3:10:01| That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| addressed to no one in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| I was just speaking for no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11405)|
| 3:10:11| Just a matter of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11411)|
| 3:10:13| what did you do to budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11413)|
| 3:10:15| for training a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| audit team that comes in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| It just takes man hours out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11419)|
| 3:10:21| existing positions like yours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| and Bo's and some staff person's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11425)|
| 3:10:27| Yes, I mean, again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11427)|
| 3:10:29| that's just part, we just consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11429)|
| 3:10:31| that part of the ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11431)|
| 3:10:35| relations that we have with our auditors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11435)|
| 3:10:37| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| We think we'll have a skilled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| group coming in. Hopefully their learning curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11443)|
| 3:10:45| be as dramatic as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11445)|
| 3:10:47| some. Yeah, I was told by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| Melissa I think that they've been looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11449)|
| 3:10:51| the work papers of Pew and so they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11451)|
| 3:10:53| getting oriented even before they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| dig deep into our files I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11455)|
| 3:10:57| Yes, they'll be here for preliminary work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| here in the next couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11459)|
| 3:11:01| and I know we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11461)|
| 3:11:03| coordinate something with the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| so that they can speak with them about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11467)|
| 3:11:13| The other piece, and I know I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| Fleet as well and we can talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11475)|
| 3:11:17| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11477)|
| 3:11:21| employee benefits and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11483)|
| 3:11:25| Fleet again, it's pretty much the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11485)|
| 3:11:27| kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11487)|
| 3:11:31| We're doing everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11491)|
| 3:11:33| we can to try and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11493)|
| 3:11:37| the energy efficiency of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| Keith can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| probably better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| speak to that than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| Elizabeth, what page are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11505)|
| 3:11:47| Page 31 for Fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11507)|
| 3:11:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| I'll go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11513)|
| 3:11:55| and just to give you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| I know you've heard this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| for basically each penny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| change in the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| of fuel, we either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| save $10,000 or it costs us $10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| and that's what it averages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| over the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| We add cat, that's roughly another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11533)|
| 3:12:15| When you think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11535)|
| 3:12:17| what kinds of things we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11537)|
| 3:12:19| working with in terms of fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| gives you the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| One penny equals $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11545)|
| 3:12:27| The other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| and we're trying to again address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| those, is the increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11551)|
| 3:12:33| cost of parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11553)|
| 3:12:35| I think Fleet is doing a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| good job in addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| Healthcare, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| Before you leave that. I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| Before you leave the Fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| looking at natural gas as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| possibly a cheap fuel of the future that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| we can somehow convert or get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| different engines? I mean, we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| at various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11577)|
| 3:12:59| alternative fuels, compressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| natural gas is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11583)|
| 3:13:05| that's just part of our overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11585)|
| 3:13:07| strategy in trying to bring down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| costs. If there's something very specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11589)|
| 3:13:11| again, I want to turn it over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11591)|
| 3:13:13| No, it's just that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| media talk in the Wall Street Journal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11595)|
| 3:13:17| and elsewhere is that that might be a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11597)|
| 3:13:19| difference going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11599)|
| 3:13:21| Well, again, we have looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| and again, one of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| that's always there, but we're still looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| is fueling sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11607)|
| 3:13:29| And I guess you have to try one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11609)|
| 3:13:31| before you can figure out if it's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| your while or not. Yeah, I mean, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| think our folks are working with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11615)|
| 3:13:37| because I think they have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| CNG fueling site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| They might have some experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11623)|
| 3:13:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| Healthcare, and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| Page 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11631)|
| 3:13:55| You'll find a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| of accounting changes in what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| we call our healthcare fund, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11639)|
| 3:14:01| some of those are just shifting accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11641)|
| 3:14:03| around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11643)|
| 3:14:05| We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| anticipating increases in healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11647)|
| 3:14:09| costs. We still hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11649)|
| 3:14:11| we'll be below the national averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| We have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| lots of good things in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| preventative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| health, and we're still looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| various things to try and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11661)|
| 3:14:23| the healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| we're like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| everybody else. We just hope to beat the national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| averages, and unfortunately, the national averages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11673)|
| 3:14:35| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11675)|
| 3:14:37| if you ask me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11677)|
| 3:14:39| what's going to happen a couple of years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| I'm not sure, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| we'll just spend the next year working through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| a lot of the things that are going to be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11687)|
| 3:14:49| I'll try and answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11689)|
| 3:14:51| any questions, and Christine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| Fitzgerald is here as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| to address any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| And I think everybody realizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| that this is the year that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| to go out for bid, that our contract with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11701)|
| 3:15:03| Blue Cross Blue Shield is up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11703)|
| 3:15:05| this fiscal year, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11705)|
| 3:15:07| Christine might want to speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| as far as a timeline. I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11709)|

| 3:15:19| Hi, I'm Christine Fitzgerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11719)|
| 3:15:21| Our RFP is out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| bid. We did have to extend it due to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| problems with our data file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11725)|
| 3:15:27| from Blue Cross Blue Shield, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11727)|
| 3:15:29| bids are due back the 31st of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11729)|
| 3:15:31| And we'll get a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| together, which will be members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| our benefits committee. We'll have about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| seven people from our benefits committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| We should have answers by the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11741)|
| 3:15:43| on who our vendor will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11743)|
| 3:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| Yes, as long as you're up there at the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| Do we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| at varying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11751)|
| 3:15:53| things like, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| the uninsured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| portion, the kept portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11757)|
| 3:15:59| whatever it is, call it copay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11759)|
| 3:16:01| or other things to keep the costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| under control? The first thing that we'll look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11763)|
| 3:16:05| at is selecting a vendor and seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| if they can currently manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11767)|
| 3:16:09| our benefits structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| within their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| system. And then we'll work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| benefits committee, council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| finance, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| mayor's office, the president's association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11779)|
| 3:16:21| and figure out, is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| deductible working? Do we need to increase our deductible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| And those plan design changes will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11785)|
| 3:16:27| after we select our vendor. I realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| every penny a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| pays for their health insurance is kind of painful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11791)|
| 3:16:33| because it's going out the door on a bet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11793)|
| 3:16:35| that they'll get, I suppose, sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| But the flip side is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| collectively we might make a difference on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11799)|
| 3:16:41| the total costs. And the one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11801)|
| 3:16:43| people can't afford is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| catastrophic event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11805)|
| 3:16:47| You go to the hospital for a month and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| surgery and the family farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| is lost unless you have insurance. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| on the lower end, you might be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11813)|
| 3:16:55| absorb some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11815)|
| 3:16:57| It's an excellent point. And our out-of-pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| right now is $2,000 for an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| and $4,000 for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11821)|
| 3:17:03| family for in-network, out-of-pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11823)|
| 3:17:05| which I think is relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11825)|
| 3:17:07| low given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11827)|
| 3:17:09| East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11829)|
| 3:17:11| Usually you want to see, usually you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11831)|
| 3:17:13| $6,000. And in fact, healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11833)|
| 3:17:15| reform, the maximum is $6,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11835)|
| 3:17:17| and $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11837)|
| 3:17:19| The ceilings have gone up in terms of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11839)|
| 3:17:21| So we're significantly lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| We hear a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11843)|
| 3:17:25| grousing when those go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11845)|
| 3:17:27| but the flip side is the city can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| save some money. Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| Trying to manage that fairly. You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11851)|
| 3:17:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| Thank you. Christine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| does that offer an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11857)|
| 3:17:39| for employees that are covered to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| plans at that time when the new bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11861)|
| 3:17:43| comes in and the plan is chosen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11863)|
| 3:17:45| so that can shift everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11865)|
| 3:17:47| Employees wouldn't be allowed to make changes until annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11867)|
| 3:17:49| enrollment, which would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11869)|
| 3:17:51| usually the October time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11871)|
| 3:17:53| And it would be for a 1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11873)|
| 3:17:55| 2014 effective date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11875)|
| 3:17:57| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11877)|
| 3:17:59| The other option would be life events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| Councilman Greer. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| Christine, it's good to put the face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| with the voice since we've had a number of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11885)|
| 3:18:07| over the last couple months. But has Blue Cross Blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11887)|
| 3:18:09| Shield, have they gotten their computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| straightened out, or is it just mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| It's mine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11893)|
| 3:18:15| Oh, is it yours, too? I think the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| is no. They haven't gotten it straightened out yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| May affidavit, sir. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| But at least we know you're there to answer. So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11903)|
| 3:18:25| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11905)|
| 3:18:27| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11907)|
| 3:18:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11909)|
| 3:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11911)|
| 3:18:41| We're going to move on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| Patricia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| Business support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11927)|
| 3:18:51| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| Oh, did I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11933)|
| 3:18:55| My bad. My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| They've been waiting patiently all morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| I just want them to wait some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11939)|
| 3:19:03| I was just looking after Christine there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11943)|
| 3:19:05| Boys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11945)|
| 3:19:07| come on down. Finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| you get your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11949)|
| 3:19:13| I told my peers there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| we had 30 minutes, and I was going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11955)|
| 3:19:17| 29 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11957)|
| 3:19:19| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11959)|
| 3:19:21| Mr. York covered really the purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11961)|
| 3:19:23| budget. There really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| no change to it from what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| had this year to this coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| except for the addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| of one position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| to help manage the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| program, and that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| as he said, approved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11979)|
| 3:19:41| not approved, but recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11981)|
| 3:19:43| in the mentor and associate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| study. And really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11985)|
| 3:19:47| that is the only change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| to the purchasing division's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11989)|
| 3:19:51| budget. Unless I'm lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11991)|
| 3:19:53| Well, that was on page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| and Jim kind of covered that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11995)|
| 3:19:57| but he also is over fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11997)|
| 3:19:59| If you have any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| questions about the fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12001)|
| 3:20:03| or the fuel or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| that we were on the other page on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| too, you can answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| Fleet is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12009)|
| 3:20:11| on 20...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12011)|
| 3:20:15| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12015)|
| 3:20:17| 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12017)|
| 3:20:21| It's in fleet there. The biggest thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12021)|

| 3:20:25| requests is another $150k| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12025)|
| 3:20:27| to cover the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12027)|
| 3:20:29| parts budget line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| item, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| I mean, we've been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| cover down on a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12035)|
| 3:20:37| this year from, because we've spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12037)|
| 3:20:39| a little under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12039)|
| 3:20:41| in fuel what had been projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12041)|
| 3:20:43| and some of that's been moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12043)|
| 3:20:45| into the parts budget, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12045)|
| 3:20:47| parts always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12047)|
| 3:20:49| remains kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12049)|
| 3:20:51| tough because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12051)|
| 3:20:53| frankly, we've got a heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| equipment shop down there, we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| kind of an aging fleet there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12059)|
| 3:21:01| the cost of those parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12061)|
| 3:21:03| continually go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12063)|
| 3:21:05| That's that $150k| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12065)|
| 3:21:07| that we think we'll need before the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12067)|
| 3:21:09| FY.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| Really, other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| we've got capital requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| and some other things, but I'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| stand by to cover any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12077)|
| 3:21:19| you may have. Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| Yes, boss. While you're up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| as far as mentoring associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| those recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| what other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| recommendations, what others are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12089)|
| 3:21:31| planning to implement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12091)|
| 3:21:33| That really goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| that position that I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12097)|
| 3:21:39| just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12099)|
| 3:21:41| Essentially, let's talk about what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| person would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12103)|
| 3:21:45| We're going to have at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| in the future, they've been now turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| into the mayor for her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| review and comment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12111)|
| 3:21:53| draft ordinances that I've been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12113)|
| 3:21:55| with the law department on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12115)|
| 3:21:57| and the community relations office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12117)|
| 3:21:59| that would assist small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12119)|
| 3:22:01| One of them is what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12121)|
| 3:22:03| call the accountability ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12123)|
| 3:22:05| that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12125)|
| 3:22:07| require departments to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12129)|
| 3:22:11| for conducting business with small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| business, minority-owned, women-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12133)|
| 3:22:15| and disabled veteran-owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| Then the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12137)|
| 3:22:19| piece of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| we require them to report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12141)|
| 3:22:23| to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12143)|
| 3:22:25| annually and the mayor semi-annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| on their progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| toward meeting said goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| Right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| I do that in a report that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| received. Frankly, it's a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| different when you've got each of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12157)|
| 3:22:39| departments on the hook to have to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| how they're doing or not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| whatever the case may be. The other one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| is the one that's going to require a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| from a person in the small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12167)|
| 3:22:49| arena and that is we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12169)|
| 3:22:51| a draft ordinance to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| that would help establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| a bottom line reader's digest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12175)|
| 3:22:57| version, bid evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| adjustments for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12179)|
| 3:23:01| you'd call small local business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12181)|
| 3:23:03| enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12183)|
| 3:23:05| You'd have to be certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12185)|
| 3:23:07| meet certain criteria that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12187)|
| 3:23:09| laid out in that document that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12189)|
| 3:23:11| provided the mayor to where you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12191)|
| 3:23:13| a locally-owned business, you're not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| franchise, you're not this, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12195)|
| 3:23:17| I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12197)|
| 3:23:19| half the size of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12199)|
| 3:23:21| small business association's definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12201)|
| 3:23:23| of a small business. There's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12203)|
| 3:23:25| of other criteria and that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12205)|
| 3:23:27| would help certify those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| businesses so they become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12209)|
| 3:23:31| what we call locally-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12211)|
| 3:23:33| small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| Once certified, then you'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12215)|
| 3:23:37| available to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12217)|
| 3:23:39| potentially receive a bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12219)|
| 3:23:41| evaluation adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| potentially as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12223)|
| 3:23:45| as up to 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12225)|
| 3:23:47| There's kind of a sliding scale in some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12227)|
| 3:23:49| and we'll get into more of that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12229)|
| 3:23:51| That person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12231)|
| 3:23:53| would be in charge of heading up a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| of those things that essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12235)|
| 3:23:57| would help small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12237)|
| 3:23:59| and try to keep the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| local to the extent possible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12241)|
| 3:24:03| help our economy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| That right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12245)|
| 3:24:07| there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12247)|
| 3:24:09| Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| those are a whole lot, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| those are, there's a lot of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| things that came out of the mentor and associate study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12255)|
| 3:24:17| but those are the ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| I guess had the most teeth in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| that in our view would help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12261)|
| 3:24:23| small businesses and disadvantaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12263)|
| 3:24:25| businesses the most and that's what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| been concentrating on to try to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12267)|
| 3:24:29| up and running and this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| will help do that. Once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| get that in place, assuming we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12273)|
| 3:24:35| then we can move on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12275)|
| 3:24:37| a lot of those other recommendations as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12277)|
| 3:24:39| that are frankly easier to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| Yeah, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| my question voice has to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12287)|
| 3:24:49| when we bump the limits up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12289)|
| 3:24:51| contracts that could be issued without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12291)|
| 3:24:53| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12293)|
| 3:24:55| extensive bidding effort, more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| negotiated small purchases, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| helping with the small businesses? In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| bumping it up to 25,000 I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12301)|
| 3:25:03| from 10, whatever we did back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| about a year and a half ago, two years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| we raised the limit from, I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12311)|
| 3:25:13| 5K to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12313)|
| 3:25:15| 25K. 25K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12315)|

| 3:25:19| Some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12319)|
| 3:25:21| Not as much as we'd like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12321)|
| 3:25:23| to. Frankly, it's making it a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12323)|
| 3:25:25| bit more easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12325)|
| 3:25:27| more expeditious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12327)|
| 3:25:29| improving our time to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12329)|
| 3:25:31| procurements down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| what they need, products and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12333)|
| 3:25:35| to the various departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| But remember, we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12337)|
| 3:25:39| and in the interest of helping small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12339)|
| 3:25:41| businesses, have what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12341)|
| 3:25:43| a quotes page, where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12343)|
| 3:25:45| try to put things up for one week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12345)|
| 3:25:47| possibly even as much as two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| between 5K and 25K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| just to give small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| a chance to compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| Find it and get in the ring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| so to speak. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| Because otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| folks wouldn't even hear about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| it until it got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| above 25K. Well, the small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12365)|
| 3:26:07| businesses, they do a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12367)|
| 3:26:09| their business things below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| $25,000. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| we still do that. But it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12373)|
| 3:26:15| improved the expediency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| And yes, our small business numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| are looking a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| But we need to improve them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12381)|
| 3:26:23| even more so, particularly for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| the local small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| You talked about the certification process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12387)|
| 3:26:29| that you're having in this new ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12389)|
| 3:26:31| and approach with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12391)|
| 3:26:33| Will that enable large contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12393)|
| 3:26:35| to find a sub that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12395)|
| 3:26:37| bring on in a big contract and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| say, this guy's doing this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| and he's already got kind of the certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| blessing that he's got the skill set to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| Actually, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| in that draft ordinance to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| if you are a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| prime and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| are going to, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| 51%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| or more of the total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| dollars for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12423)|
| 3:27:05| contract are going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| to locally owned small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| as certified by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| then you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12431)|
| 3:27:13| or Ms. Prime, would be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| overall for that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| to receive that bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| evaluation adjustment. So you get an evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12439)|
| 3:27:21| that in essence adjusts your bid price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| down to get credit for using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12443)|
| 3:27:25| local small business? That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| You don't think that will hurt quality, but it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12447)|
| 3:27:29| encourage hiring small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12449)|
| 3:27:31| that are local? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| We do something similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12453)|
| 3:27:35| right now on providing up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12455)|
| 3:27:37| 10 points with like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12457)|
| 3:27:39| RFQs and RFPs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| your plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| utilize small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| the teaming, particularly in the professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| service industry, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12469)|
| 3:27:51| increased tremendously over the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| I'll say two and a half, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12473)|
| 3:27:55| It's a lot different than it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12475)|
| 3:27:57| and it's because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12477)|
| 3:27:59| If you encourage folks to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12479)|
| 3:28:01| small businesses, they do so. If you don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12481)|
| 3:28:03| they won't. Do veterans get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12483)|
| 3:28:05| any kind of a preference, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12485)|
| 3:28:07| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12487)|
| 3:28:09| It is strictly focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12489)|
| 3:28:11| toward small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12491)|
| 3:28:13| That is correct. Now, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12493)|
| 3:28:15| truth of the matter is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12495)|
| 3:28:17| a lot of your small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| businesses are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12499)|
| 3:28:21| disadvantaged business enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12501)|
| 3:28:23| So, in a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| you're getting to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12505)|
| 3:28:27| market the same way, but no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| it has been limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| in scope to small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| Councilman Wallace. Just one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12515)|
| 3:28:37| quick clarification. You talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12517)|
| 3:28:39| about, I guess, how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| describe a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| You said no franchise or not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| franchise. What did you mean? That's correct. In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| you have to have all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| the information's in there, but you have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| a business that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| in other words, owned and operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| within the confines of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12535)|
| 3:28:57| geographical area that we've set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| forth to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| considered a locally owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12543)|
| 3:29:05| Instead of a dummy branch or something that's put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12545)|
| 3:29:07| That's correct. A dummy branch, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12547)|
| 3:29:09| you can't be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| independently operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| franchisee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| of a company, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12555)|
| 3:29:17| You have to be at arm's distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| from any other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12559)|
| 3:29:23| Okay. That's how the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| is in there, and it's got some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12565)|
| 3:29:27| I was just curious, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12567)|
| 3:29:29| I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12569)|
| 3:29:31| franchise business, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| locally owned and operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12573)|
| 3:29:35| Does that mean I'm being disqualified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12575)|
| 3:29:37| I mean, that's what I didn't understand. I don't think you'd be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12577)|
| 3:29:39| for the business valuation adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| I'd have to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| That's what I would question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12583)|
| 3:29:45| I think the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12585)|
| 3:29:47| I would question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12591)|
| 3:29:53| What are you planning on doing at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12593)|
| 3:29:55| impound office building, the $175,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| for your capital project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| I'd rather have Keith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| prepare to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| It's a real good thing that we're trying to do there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12603)|
| 3:30:05| but I'd like him to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12605)|
| 3:30:07| Okay. Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12609)|
| 3:30:11| Delvaux mentioned about veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12611)|
| 3:30:13| and Vickie Hatfield is gone anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12613)|
| 3:30:15| but do we have a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12615)|
| 3:30:17| where people who are applying for city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12617)|
| 3:30:19| jobs, do veterans get any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12619)|
| 3:30:21| preference for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| I know that's not what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| As a regular employee, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12625)|
| 3:30:27| Not a contract, but an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12627)|
| 3:30:29| Not a contract. This is probably off of our subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12629)|
| 3:30:31| but you mentioned veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12631)|
| 3:30:33| I don't know. Dr. Lyons, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12633)|
| 3:30:35| know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12635)|
| 3:30:37| I don't know for sure, to tell you the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| but I'll check on that to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12639)|
| 3:30:41| All right. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12641)|
| 3:30:43| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| Thank you. The impound building, what we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12645)|
| 3:30:47| currently operating out of is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12647)|
| 3:30:49| leftover concession stand from the BMX| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12649)|
| 3:30:51| track. It's built on a landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12651)|
| 3:30:53| It's continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12653)|
| 3:30:55| shifting. Center blocks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12655)|
| 3:30:57| separating. We're filling it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12657)|
| 3:30:59| with caulk to keep it running day-to-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12659)|
| 3:31:01| If any of our team members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12661)|
| 3:31:03| want to use the restroom, they have to go outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12663)|
| 3:31:05| the main office and around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12665)|
| 3:31:07| the corner to the restrooms that are part of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12667)|
| 3:31:09| but as a former concession stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12669)|
| 3:31:11| they were located on the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| So what we are proposing is building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12673)|
| 3:31:15| approximately a 1,000-square-foot building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12675)|
| 3:31:17| to house the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12677)|
| 3:31:19| impound office for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12679)|
| 3:31:21| auctions and for the day-to-day business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12681)|
| 3:31:23| They're open 24-7, 365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12683)|
| 3:31:25| And what this will do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| we want to relocate it to the east end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| of the property and let it provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12689)|
| 3:31:31| as a security checkpoint for that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12691)|
| 3:31:33| also, that we can have a gate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| you can close and you have to be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12695)|
| 3:31:37| official business to come up there after hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12697)|
| 3:31:39| or on the weekends. As it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| the property is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12701)|
| 3:31:43| You can drive in, drive out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12703)|
| 3:31:45| And while we monitor the cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| they can't always go out and check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12707)|
| 3:31:49| the validity of everybody coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12709)|
| 3:31:51| By moving it and constructing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12711)|
| 3:31:53| the gate, you'll have to have a reason to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12713)|
| 3:31:55| there. This will protect the canine center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12715)|
| 3:31:57| the Knoxville Fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| Department training center, the light shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12719)|
| 3:32:01| the impound vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12721)|
| 3:32:03| and any other vehicles that KPD may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12723)|
| 3:32:05| there under investigation without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12725)|
| 3:32:07| having somebody coming in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| having eyes on a vehicle or possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12729)|
| 3:32:11| breaching the area and getting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12731)|
| 3:32:13| there. So it's going to be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12733)|
| 3:32:15| a new impound building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12735)|
| 3:32:17| Basically, a little over 1,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12737)|
| 3:32:19| is what we have planned out for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12739)|
| 3:32:21| What other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12741)|
| 3:32:23| do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| Glad you could hold it together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| with caulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12747)|
| 3:32:29| That's pretty much the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12749)|
| 3:32:31| It's an energy hog, and it's just inefficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12751)|
| 3:32:33| and in some respects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| not safe for the employees to be there when they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12755)|
| 3:32:37| to leave the building to go to the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12757)|
| 3:32:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12759)|
| 3:32:41| Any further questions? If not, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12761)|
| 3:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12765)|
| 3:32:47| Jensen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12767)|
| 3:32:49| So he's part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12769)|
| 3:32:51| of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12771)|
| 3:32:53| of the mayor's budget, so go back to page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12773)|
| 3:32:55| one in your handout, and he's that last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| work at the very bottom of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12777)|
| 3:32:59| the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12779)|
| 3:33:03| Good afternoon. I always enjoy this part of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| because I get to brag on our employees just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12785)|
| 3:33:07| tad, but at 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12787)|
| 3:33:09| we're Knoxville's phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| We have contact with anywhere from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| 220,000 to a quarter million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12793)|
| 3:33:15| of our customers a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12795)|
| 3:33:17| We answer those calls in an average of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12797)|
| 3:33:19| 17 seconds, and it takes about a minute and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12799)|
| 3:33:21| to handle each and every one of those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12801)|
| 3:33:23| We have over 100 different service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12803)|
| 3:33:25| request types that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12805)|
| 3:33:27| Now we've been open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12807)|
| 3:33:29| since 2005, eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12809)|
| 3:33:31| We've got a lot of data that we can go back and look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12811)|
| 3:33:33| And some good news, this is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12813)|
| 3:33:35| the first year that our call volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12815)|
| 3:33:37| has gone down just a tick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12817)|
| 3:33:39| And the reason I say that's good news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12819)|
| 3:33:41| it's not that we're losing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12821)|
| 3:33:43| Quite frankly, we're one of only two or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12823)|
| 3:33:45| three cities in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12825)|
| 3:33:47| that gets more calls than we have citizens in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12827)|
| 3:33:49| which shows that we've done a really good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12829)|
| 3:33:51| throughout the years of marketing the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12831)|
| 3:33:53| making sure everybody knows it's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| getting people to call that number, and more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12835)|
| 3:33:57| that they feel comfortable using that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12837)|
| 3:33:59| to either ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| or get service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12841)|
| 3:34:03| This year, there's been just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| a slight downtick. We're going to be in that 220,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12845)|
| 3:34:07| range, whereas a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12847)|
| 3:34:09| and a half ago, for a 12-month period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12849)|
| 3:34:11| we were right at a quarter million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| People are literally complaining about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| fewer things, and a lot of that has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12855)|
| 3:34:17| with what's going out in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| Proactive inspections in lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| and codes enforcement, things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12861)|
| 3:34:23| that, so we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12863)|
| 3:34:25| being as reactive and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12865)|
| 3:34:27| as complaint-driven. We still get just as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12867)|
| 3:34:29| many calls for information, everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12869)|
| 3:34:31| from where do I park to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12871)|
| 3:34:33| road is closed to what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12873)|
| 3:34:35| during football weekend, but fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12875)|
| 3:34:37| complaints over the course of the same year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| by about 2.5%, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12879)|
| 3:34:41| is pretty significant. Recently, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12881)|
| 3:34:43| city of Minneapolis did a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12883)|
| 3:34:45| and back when we first opened 311 in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12885)|
| 3:34:47| you could count on both hands how many there were in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12887)|
| 3:34:49| Now, there are over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12889)|
| 3:34:51| 160 311 centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| or something like it, in cities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12893)|
| 3:34:55| The city of Minneapolis did a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12895)|
| 3:34:57| this last year, and they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12897)|

| 3:35:01| The average first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| call resolution was the number of people that called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| and didn't have to call again, or didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12905)|
| 3:35:07| have to call somebody else. The national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12907)|
| 3:35:09| average was 80, and ours was 87%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12909)|
| 3:35:11| The average abandon rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12911)|
| 3:35:13| which is people that were hanging up before they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12913)|
| 3:35:15| getting picked up nationally, was 13%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12915)|
| 3:35:17| Ours is 8.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| And the cost per contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| and a lot of cities use by contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12921)|
| 3:35:23| they use phone calls, emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12923)|
| 3:35:25| website visits, they use everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12925)|
| 3:35:27| We only count calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| and we call that fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12929)|
| 3:35:31| loaded, because we put all our costs into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12931)|
| 3:35:33| The national average was $4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12933)|
| 3:35:35| per call. Ours is $1.70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12935)|
| 3:35:37| In virtually every category in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| study, and it's the third one that's been done in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| eight years, and fortunately they're done by other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| not us. We've either been at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12943)|
| 3:35:45| top, or one of the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12945)|
| 3:35:47| three as far as cost effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12947)|
| 3:35:49| and service. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12949)|
| 3:35:51| do surveys here at home of our customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12951)|
| 3:35:53| and the computer actually decides who we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12953)|
| 3:35:55| to survey. We don't get to pick who we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12955)|
| 3:35:57| thought had a good experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| 97% of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| say that the person that answered the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| phone was courteous and polite. And just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12963)|
| 3:36:05| anybody that says no to that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12965)|
| 3:36:07| gets a phone call from me, because I want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| why. Were the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| answered appropriately? Once again, 97%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12971)|
| 3:36:13| And was your request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12973)|
| 3:36:15| handled in a timely manner? 87% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| the people in Knoxville say yes. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12977)|
| 3:36:19| that's important for two reasons. Number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12979)|
| 3:36:21| show me another city where 9 out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| 10 people say that their service request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| was handled in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12985)|
| 3:36:27| I think you're going to have trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12987)|
| 3:36:29| finding that in another city. And that speaks volumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12989)|
| 3:36:31| to the people out where the rubber meets the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12991)|
| 3:36:33| that are doing the work, going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12993)|
| 3:36:35| and getting things done in a very timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12995)|
| 3:36:37| And just as importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12997)|
| 3:36:39| we also have internal standards that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=12999)|
| 3:36:41| measure department by department, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13001)|
| 3:36:43| 10 month out, quarter in, quarter out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13003)|
| 3:36:45| our on-time performance measured by our own standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13005)|
| 3:36:47| is 86 to 87%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13007)|
| 3:36:49| So over the time, we've done a really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13009)|
| 3:36:51| job of managing our standards to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13011)|
| 3:36:53| customer's expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13013)|
| 3:36:55| So with that, I'll turn it over to you all, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| we don't have anything significant as far as changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| in the budget. I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13019)|
| 3:37:01| everybody knows, you do get a lot of bang for your buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13021)|
| 3:37:03| They make people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13023)|
| 3:37:05| very happy. I'm very, very fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| with the staff we have up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13027)|
| 3:37:09| They actually like what they do. They take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13029)|
| 3:37:11| very, very good care of people, which makes my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| Councilman? Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13037)|
| 3:37:19| I think I can speak on behalf of all my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| We really appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| ability, one, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13043)|
| 3:37:25| refer constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13045)|
| 3:37:27| to 311 to solve their problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| and two, the fact that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13049)|
| 3:37:31| get good, fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| fair treatment. I mean, it really does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13053)|
| 3:37:35| help, because us old folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13055)|
| 3:37:37| can't remember seven digits, but we can remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13057)|
| 3:37:39| 311, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| happy to remember it, and they're pretty good about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13061)|
| 3:37:43| even if you're in a car, they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13063)|
| 3:37:45| remember 311 and give you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13065)|
| 3:37:47| a call. My question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13067)|
| 3:37:51| when you see a pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13071)|
| 3:37:53| of calls about some particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13073)|
| 3:37:55| problem, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| there some way that you get that beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13077)|
| 3:37:59| the onesie level to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| a group to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13081)|
| 3:38:03| solve whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13083)|
| 3:38:05| the complaint process is, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13085)|
| 3:38:07| whatever? In other words, is there some way to kick it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13087)|
| 3:38:09| so that it gets more scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13089)|
| 3:38:11| by the management of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13091)|
| 3:38:13| so to speak? Absolutely, and that's the beauty of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13093)|
| 3:38:15| them all in one room, and the way we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13095)|
| 3:38:17| built the room, where everybody can see each other, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13097)|
| 3:38:19| talk to each other, and if you start getting several phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13099)|
| 3:38:21| calls on the same thing, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13101)|
| 3:38:23| I get to hear it right away, but more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| they start asking each other, hey, are you getting phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13105)|
| 3:38:27| calls about such and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| Miss Trash Complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13109)|
| 3:38:31| when we changed over to the curbside recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| there was a little hiccup there. Right away, we knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13113)|
| 3:38:35| about it, and we were able to identify where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| During and after storms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13117)|
| 3:38:39| where do we have road issues, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| We do that quite a bit, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| you'll either hear the phone ringing, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| see an email, or the pitter-patter of my little feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13125)|
| 3:38:47| going from one department to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| depending on what the problem is. So they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13129)|
| 3:38:51| put out the fire, so to speak, before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| it gets worse? Well, we don't. That goes to the folks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| I'm saying the actual functional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| organizations. But we get the word to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13137)|
| 3:38:59| a lot quicker than we did back in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| old days. Is there some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13141)|
| 3:39:03| form of database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13143)|
| 3:39:05| that is the equivalent of a frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| asked question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13147)|
| 3:39:09| Absolutely. You can give someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13149)|
| 3:39:11| you can say, hey, there's this background here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13151)|
| 3:39:13| if you want to look at this, or whatever. Yeah, the CRM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13153)|
| 3:39:15| software that we use, which is Motorola,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13155)|
| 3:39:17| has a knowledge base built into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13157)|
| 3:39:19| it, and we're constantly adding notes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13159)|
| 3:39:21| that. Does that help your person, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13161)|
| 3:39:23| the person on the receiving end of the line, is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13163)|
| 3:39:25| I'm asking, I guess? Both. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| what we do is we store questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13167)|
| 3:39:29| in particular, if we get something for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| we keep it for later, and of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13171)|
| 3:39:33| we wind up using that with the next person that calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13173)|
| 3:39:35| with the same question. Built into that, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13175)|
| 3:39:37| got an FAQ section as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13177)|
| 3:39:39| and even though we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13179)|
| 3:39:41| very tech-oriented, we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13181)|
| 3:39:43| try to keep it on a personal level, and every one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13183)|
| 3:39:45| of those operators in there has a notebook about this thick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| of things that they keep as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13187)|
| 3:39:49| they find new information. But more importantly, they share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13189)|
| 3:39:51| it with each other. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13191)|
| 3:39:53| half the problem constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13193)|
| 3:39:55| have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13195)|
| 3:39:57| getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| the runaround, which we've solved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13199)|
| 3:40:01| by this system, and I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13201)|
| 3:40:03| really good that they have someone to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13203)|
| 3:40:05| and get the sense that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13205)|
| 3:40:07| someone's going to actually take the ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13207)|
| 3:40:09| and run with it. So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| Well, and they constantly walk that tightrope of remembering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13211)|
| 3:40:13| that they are a city employee, but they're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| an advocate for the caller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13215)|
| 3:40:17| That's one of their challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13217)|
| 3:40:19| But like I said, we've got a really good group up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13219)|
| 3:40:21| so it makes my life pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13221)|
| 3:40:23| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13223)|
| 3:40:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13225)|
| 3:40:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13229)|
| 3:40:31| And I think this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13231)|
| 3:40:33| last part of the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| office, finally. If you look on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13235)|
| 3:40:37| two at the very top of the page, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13237)|

| 3:40:47| Well, I mean, she spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| but... This is Patricia. Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13249)|

| 3:40:53| Christine...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13253)|
| 3:40:55| I think we just jumped around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13255)|
| 3:40:57| Get it out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| She covered everything that she needed to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13259)|
| 3:41:01| Okay. Just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13261)|
| 3:41:03| I've called you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13263)|
| 3:41:05| here two times. I must be anxious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13265)|
| 3:41:07| to know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13267)|
| 3:41:09| That's all right. Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13269)|
| 3:41:11| I am in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13271)|
| 3:41:13| Office of Business Support, have been at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13273)|
| 3:41:15| for a little bit, and it has been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13275)|
| 3:41:17| very exciting time. I'm happy to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13277)|
| 3:41:19| that we now reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13279)|
| 3:41:21| to more than 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| business owners in a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13283)|
| 3:41:25| which is more than we used to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13285)|
| 3:41:27| before, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| my job was to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| where in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13291)|
| 3:41:33| processes in the city I could reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13293)|
| 3:41:35| out to them and introduce the Office of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| Business Support and to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13297)|
| 3:41:39| my services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| So now the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| business license holders all hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| from me, not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| 100 a month or so, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| give them information with the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13309)|
| 3:41:51| business guides that I have, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| that has a lot of information about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13313)|
| 3:41:55| different processes and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13315)|
| 3:41:57| and sign ordinance and building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13317)|
| 3:41:59| permits and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13319)|
| 3:42:01| I also reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| to all of those who have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13323)|
| 3:42:05| certificates of occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13325)|
| 3:42:07| and or completion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13327)|
| 3:42:09| and they receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| a survey that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| created, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13333)|

| 3:42:19| upload their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13339)|
| 3:42:21| plans through Project Docs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13341)|
| 3:42:23| for electronic review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13343)|
| 3:42:25| An email is generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13345)|
| 3:42:27| and so I'm able to reach out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13347)|
| 3:42:29| and let them know about the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13349)|
| 3:42:31| All licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13351)|
| 3:42:33| subcontractors, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13353)|
| 3:42:35| they renew their license with the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13355)|
| 3:42:37| Knoxville, they hear from me. So that's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13357)|
| 3:42:39| the electrical, plumbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13359)|

| 3:42:45| the visitors to plans reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13365)|
| 3:42:47| also hear from me. The ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13367)|
| 3:42:49| receive their contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13369)|

| 3:42:53| into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13373)|
| 3:42:55| And then the contact that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13375)|
| 3:42:57| through the different business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13377)|

| 3:43:01| civic organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13381)|
| 3:43:03| to let them know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13383)|
| 3:43:05| the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13385)|
| 3:43:09| The survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13389)|

| 3:43:19| their experience with the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13399)|

| 3:43:29| all the subpermit inspectors like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13409)|

| 3:43:37| council, and we meet on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13417)|
| 3:43:39| And so that has been also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| a very helpful thing to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13421)|
| 3:43:43| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13423)|
| 3:43:45| I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13425)|
| 3:43:47| the liaison for the city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13427)|
| 3:43:49| and the businesses, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13429)|
| 3:43:51| also to outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13431)|
| 3:43:53| the city, to different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13433)|
| 3:43:55| agencies. So I get a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13435)|
| 3:43:57| of questions related to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| business process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13439)|

| 3:44:03| Knoxville Chamber, or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13443)|

| 3:44:09| almost to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13449)|

| 3:44:13| other agencies. So that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13453)|
| 3:44:15| really helpful to both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| the business owners and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13457)|

| 3:44:29| how are you reaching out to them? By a letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| In different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13471)|
| 3:44:33| Those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13473)|
| 3:44:35| provide an email address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13475)|
| 3:44:37| I reach out to them that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13477)|
| 3:44:39| and they also get a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| Kind of a double whammy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13481)|
| 3:44:43| Not all of them leave their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13483)|
| 3:44:45| email address. Some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13485)|
| 3:44:47| just leave a phone number, and sometimes I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13487)|
| 3:44:49| just pick up the phone and make some calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13489)|
| 3:44:51| So it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13491)|
| 3:44:53| I've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13493)|
| 3:44:55| been interested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13495)|
| 3:44:57| office ever since we created it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13497)|
| 3:44:59| So year to date, what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13499)|
| 3:45:01| you say would be your greatest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13501)|
| 3:45:03| accomplishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13503)|
| 3:45:05| Oh, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13505)|
| 3:45:07| I think just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13507)|
| 3:45:09| identifying, for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13509)|
| 3:45:11| identifying, getting to know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13511)|
| 3:45:13| different city departments, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13513)|
| 3:45:15| working with pretty much every department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13515)|
| 3:45:17| which was a big surprise to me when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13517)|
| 3:45:19| came in. Like one of the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13519)|
| 3:45:21| offices that I worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13521)|
| 3:45:23| with was the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13523)|
| 3:45:25| So I had no idea that that would even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13525)|
| 3:45:27| be in the radar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13527)|
| 3:45:29| for me as a business liaison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| But I had to pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13531)|
| 3:45:33| work with every single department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13533)|
| 3:45:35| And in so doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13535)|
| 3:45:37| I have learned about the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13537)|
| 3:45:39| processes and have gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| to meet all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| key players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| And so I'm able to be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13545)|
| 3:45:47| helpful when a business calls and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13547)|
| 3:45:49| an issue. And so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13549)|
| 3:45:51| that that has been really positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| A good example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13553)|
| 3:45:55| was the pedicab business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13555)|
| 3:45:57| that you all voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13557)|
| 3:45:59| That was a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13559)|
| 3:46:01| kind of straight trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| Not all of them are that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13563)|
| 3:46:05| Some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| issues are complicated, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13567)|
| 3:46:09| they go beyond city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13569)|
| 3:46:11| They go through TDOT or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| state or federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13573)|
| 3:46:15| mandates of stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13575)|
| 3:46:17| that the city has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13577)|
| 3:46:19| abide by. So some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| are very complicated. But the pedicab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| was kind of a straight shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| It was good for me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13585)|
| 3:46:27| coordinate meetings with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| different city departments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| get them all around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| to talk about it and the business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13593)|
| 3:46:35| and get that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| through the law department to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| on that and then bring it to you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13599)|
| 3:46:41| two readings. And so that was, for me, a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| neat process to see start to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13603)|
| 3:46:45| finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13605)|
| 3:46:47| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13607)|
| 3:46:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| On a proactive basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13611)|
| 3:46:53| what is your relationship with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13613)|
| 3:46:55| Entrepreneur Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13615)|
| 3:46:57| Yeah. My relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13617)|
| 3:46:59| with the Entrepreneur Center is pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| like the rest of the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13621)|
| 3:47:03| like the Knoxville Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13623)|
| 3:47:05| or TSBDC. I use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13625)|
| 3:47:07| them, and they use me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13627)|
| 3:47:09| We are in contact with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13629)|
| 3:47:11| So, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13631)|
| 3:47:13| Michael Carroll has been the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13633)|
| 3:47:15| has been contracted to run the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13635)|
| 3:47:17| Entrepreneur Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| But we are in touch quite often. He calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13639)|
| 3:47:21| me about city processes, and I send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13641)|
| 3:47:23| him people that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| would be a good fit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| So what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13647)|
| 3:47:29| now is they're consulting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13649)|
| 3:47:31| approximately 25 entrepreneurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13651)|
| 3:47:33| and next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| month they will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13655)|
| 3:47:37| starting an eight-week program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| where they'll meet twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13659)|
| 3:47:41| a week, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13661)|
| 3:47:43| it'll be for eight weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13663)|
| 3:47:45| and they'll sort of have this first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13665)|
| 3:47:47| graduating class, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13667)|
| 3:47:49| each of these 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13669)|
| 3:47:51| entrepreneurs will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13671)|
| 3:47:53| kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13673)|
| 3:47:55| have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13675)|
| 3:47:57| explanation of their business and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13677)|
| 3:47:59| present their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13679)|
| 3:48:01| Right now, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13681)|
| 3:48:03| are doing different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13683)|
| 3:48:05| focus areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13685)|
| 3:48:07| So, renewable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13687)|
| 3:48:09| energy is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13689)|
| 3:48:11| one of them, and then data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13691)|
| 3:48:13| analytics will be another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13693)|
| 3:48:15| Outdoor lifestyle, fitness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13695)|
| 3:48:17| and nutrition businesses will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13697)|
| 3:48:19| be another one. So they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13699)|
| 3:48:21| trying to find focus, businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13701)|
| 3:48:23| that want to focus on different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13703)|
| 3:48:25| and put their classes through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13705)|
| 3:48:27| So once they're finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13707)|
| 3:48:29| then you can help them set up their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13709)|
| 3:48:31| There you go. Some of them have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| already reached out in terms of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13713)|
| 3:48:35| kind of licenses they need, more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13715)|
| 3:48:37| city-specific processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13717)|
| 3:48:41| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13721)|
| 3:48:43| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13723)|
| 3:48:45| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13725)|
| 3:48:47| Ms. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13727)|
| 3:48:53| I was told I only had 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13733)|
| 3:48:55| Name and address, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13735)|
| 3:48:57| 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13737)|
| 3:48:59| There's really nothing new to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13739)|
| 3:49:01| share with you about our operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13741)|
| 3:49:03| It's basically flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| We have 27| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13745)|
| 3:49:07| people. We take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13747)|
| 3:49:09| of 2,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13749)|
| 3:49:11| devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13751)|
| 3:49:13| computers, printers, hardware, software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13755)|
| 3:49:17| phones, you name it, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13757)|
| 3:49:19| about 166| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13759)|
| 3:49:21| devices per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13761)|
| 3:49:23| So yes, we are lean, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13763)|
| 3:49:25| are mean, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13765)|
| 3:49:27| this is what we have to do to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13767)|
| 3:49:29| It continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13769)|
| 3:49:31| So are there any questions about our operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| budget? And I do have one capital project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13773)|
| 3:49:35| request. Any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13775)|
| 3:49:37| about... I could kind of get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13777)|
| 3:49:39| where you are. On page four is her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| operating budget, and then her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13781)|
| 3:49:43| one capital request is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13783)|

| 3:49:51| Is that AVL system for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13791)|
| 3:49:53| the buses? Is that what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13793)|
| 3:49:55| No, that's actually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13795)|
| 3:49:57| work order management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13797)|
| 3:49:59| that's integrated with AVL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13799)|
| 3:50:01| So those GPS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13801)|
| 3:50:03| devices would go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13803)|
| 3:50:05| every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13805)|
| 3:50:07| fleet car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13807)|
| 3:50:09| that we have out there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13809)|
| 3:50:11| the dump trucks. We're wanting to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13811)|
| 3:50:13| where people are, where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13813)|
| 3:50:15| work's being performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13815)|
| 3:50:17| We're going to be tracking hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13817)|
| 3:50:19| inventory. It touches a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| of departments. We're actually going to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13821)|
| 3:50:23| the 311 software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13823)|
| 3:50:25| because we feel like it sort of starts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13825)|
| 3:50:27| And we've, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13827)|
| 3:50:29| Councilman Wallace's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13829)|
| 3:50:31| he talked about capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13831)|
| 3:50:33| You know, which ones do we think we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13833)|
| 3:50:35| the best bang for our buck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13835)|
| 3:50:37| We've been working on this for about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13837)|
| 3:50:39| a year, and we were tasked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13839)|
| 3:50:41| to look at the entire city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13841)|
| 3:50:43| and see where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13843)|
| 3:50:45| inefficiencies, and we believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13845)|
| 3:50:47| this software package combined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13847)|
| 3:50:49| with AVL and new inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13849)|
| 3:50:51| control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13851)|
| 3:50:53| and time and labor control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13853)|
| 3:50:55| will really prove to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13855)|
| 3:50:57| one of the best things we've done in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13857)|
| 3:50:59| But it's pricey. It's $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13859)|
| 3:51:01| But it touches 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13861)|
| 3:51:03| public service, engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13865)|
| 3:51:07| Is it used elsewhere? I mean, is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13867)|
| 3:51:09| a proven system? We've looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| at several. One of the things we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13871)|
| 3:51:13| when we try to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13873)|
| 3:51:15| how much these things are going to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13875)|
| 3:51:17| we actually go out and talk to vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13877)|
| 3:51:19| and have them come in and give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13879)|
| 3:51:21| presentations so that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13881)|
| 3:51:23| we have to know. I'm a big one on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13883)|
| 3:51:25| it's got to be installed somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13885)|
| 3:51:27| before. We don't like to be the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13887)|
| 3:51:29| because then you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13889)|
| 3:51:31| constantly getting the bugs out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13891)|
| 3:51:33| Salesmen usually add a few extra features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13893)|
| 3:51:35| too when they're talking to you. Sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13895)|
| 3:51:37| there's smoke and mirrors. That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13897)|
| 3:51:39| And so what we're trying to find out, and we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13899)|
| 3:51:41| believe that there are viable packages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13901)|
| 3:51:43| out there that have all these modules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13903)|
| 3:51:45| that are integrated together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13905)|
| 3:51:47| And what we want to do too, which always takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13907)|
| 3:51:49| a long time, this is a year-long project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13909)|
| 3:51:51| is data conversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13911)|
| 3:51:53| like Russ talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13913)|
| 3:51:55| All the good data that he's captured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13915)|
| 3:51:57| over the years. We've also, with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13917)|
| 3:51:59| public service software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13919)|
| 3:52:01| that's been in place since the early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13921)|
| 3:52:03| 1990s. It's older than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13923)|
| 3:52:05| dirt. So it needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13925)|
| 3:52:07| to be, you know, we just need to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13927)|
| 3:52:09| at that whole area. And I think out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13929)|
| 3:52:11| that, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13931)|
| 3:52:13| going to see better customer service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13933)|
| 3:52:15| because we're going to be more in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13935)|
| 3:52:17| touch with what's going on. We're going to have better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13937)|
| 3:52:19| management. We're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13939)|
| 3:52:21| to look at mobile devices in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13941)|
| 3:52:23| the field so that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13943)|
| 3:52:25| know historically what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| at that location from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13947)|
| 3:52:29| crime to previous work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13949)|
| 3:52:31| to utility work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13951)|
| 3:52:33| And we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13953)|
| 3:52:35| grouping our work orders by location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13955)|
| 3:52:37| too. They do that now manually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13957)|
| 3:52:39| but this will give them the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13959)|
| 3:52:41| to do that, to let the computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13961)|
| 3:52:43| do some of that. What we're finding out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13963)|
| 3:52:45| is a lot of this software is map based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13965)|
| 3:52:47| It's location based. So now we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13967)|
| 3:52:49| be able to look at a map and you'll be able to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13969)|
| 3:52:51| where all your vehicles are and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13971)|
| 3:52:53| you'll be able to see what they're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13973)|
| 3:52:55| So if five or six trucks converge on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13975)|
| 3:52:57| Krispy Kreme, you might look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13977)|
| 3:52:59| That would send out an alert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13979)|
| 3:53:01| I'll say we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13981)|
| 3:53:03| installed this same system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13983)|
| 3:53:05| for your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13985)|
| 3:53:07| The savings in the productivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| is phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13989)|
| 3:53:11| Because you get people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13991)|
| 3:53:13| a location faster or because they know they're being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13993)|
| 3:53:15| watched and they don't mess around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13995)|
| 3:53:17| It's not so much being watched as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13997)|
| 3:53:19| just make sure that the efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=13999)|
| 3:53:21| are there. You can handle things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| close to each other. Even if you're idling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14003)|
| 3:53:25| your vehicle for too long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14005)|
| 3:53:27| and ours detects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14007)|
| 3:53:29| speed, the speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14009)|
| 3:53:31| of the vehicle as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14011)|
| 3:53:33| It was a huge investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14013)|
| 3:53:35| It's big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14015)|
| 3:53:37| Any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| about that? We'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14019)|
| 3:53:41| go through the RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14021)|
| 3:53:43| more than likely, especially for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14023)|
| 3:53:45| AVL piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14025)|
| 3:53:47| It's going to be a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14027)|
| 3:53:49| before you see some results. We'll probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14029)|
| 3:53:51| do the AVL piece first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14031)|
| 3:53:53| because we think that's where we'll get the best thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14033)|
| 3:53:55| for our buck and then we'll do the work order piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14035)|
| 3:53:57| It's a year long project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14037)|
| 3:53:59| We have other capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14039)|
| 3:54:01| just to let you know a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14041)|
| 3:54:03| our department, how we're funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14043)|
| 3:54:05| This is a citywide project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14045)|
| 3:54:07| so it falls under my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14047)|
| 3:54:09| You'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14049)|
| 3:54:11| other departments come up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14051)|
| 3:54:13| You saw the web design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14053)|
| 3:54:15| Those departments take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| of that, but we are their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14057)|
| 3:54:19| eyes and feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14059)|
| 3:54:21| and whatever that we implement the systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14061)|
| 3:54:23| Is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14063)|
| 3:54:25| going to put this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14065)|
| 3:54:27| council members' vehicles, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14067)|
| 3:54:29| I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14069)|
| 3:54:31| answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14071)|
| 3:54:33| I'm riding a bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14073)|
| 3:54:35| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14075)|
| 3:54:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14077)|
| 3:54:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14079)|
| 3:54:41| We better end this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14081)|
| 3:54:45| As they come up here to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14085)|
| 3:54:47| discussing CAT, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14087)|
| 3:54:49| point out a big typo that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14089)|
| 3:54:51| George and I found yesterday when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14091)|
| 3:54:53| discussing CAT. On page 29 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14093)|
| 3:54:55| the handout, there's a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14095)|
| 3:54:57| purple block on the right hand side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14097)|
| 3:54:59| under CAT, and it's talking about how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14099)|
| 3:55:01| the general fund transfer is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14101)|
| 3:55:03| mass transit. And then the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14103)|
| 3:55:05| line, it's the general fund transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14105)|
| 3:55:07| for demand. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14107)|
| 3:55:09| one too many threes in there. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14109)|
| 3:55:11| supposed to be $734,920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14111)|
| 3:55:15| That makes a little bit of a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14115)|
| 3:55:17| It makes a huge difference because, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14117)|
| 3:55:19| Jim has pointed out in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14119)|
| 3:55:21| narrative, it's $11.9 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14121)|
| 3:55:23| is the operating support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14123)|
| 3:55:25| this year that's funded in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14125)|
| 3:55:27| for CAT. And that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14127)|
| 3:55:29| operational piece plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14129)|
| 3:55:31| this fund that you're looking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14131)|
| 3:55:35| And with that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14135)|
| 3:55:37| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14137)|
| 3:55:39| Over 16,000 times a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14139)|
| 3:55:41| day, CAT co-workers get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14141)|
| 3:55:43| interact with people in this community through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14143)|
| 3:55:45| the city's bus system. We've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14145)|
| 3:55:47| over 25 months of consecutive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14147)|
| 3:55:49| increasing ridership since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14149)|
| 3:55:51| transit center has opened. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14151)|
| 3:55:53| ending fiscal year 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14153)|
| 3:55:55| in a very strong financial position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14155)|
| 3:55:57| And next year is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14157)|
| 3:55:59| a bit of a transition year as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14159)|
| 3:56:01| we recover from the loss of the UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14161)|
| 3:56:03| contract. As you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14163)|
| 3:56:05| have a plan in place that's going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14165)|
| 3:56:07| advantage of additional federal funding to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14167)|
| 3:56:09| area to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14169)|
| 3:56:11| service frequencies on main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14171)|
| 3:56:13| routes. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14173)|
| 3:56:15| there's nothing intuitive about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14175)|
| 3:56:17| transit budgeting, but I'll be happy to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14179)|
| 3:56:21| And I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14181)|
| 3:56:23| sometimes CAT staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14183)|
| 3:56:25| deals with cash budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14185)|
| 3:56:27| and oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14187)|
| 3:56:29| the numbers you see include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14189)|
| 3:56:31| other depreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14191)|
| 3:56:33| numbers. So sometimes I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14193)|
| 3:56:35| have the exact same numbers that you're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14195)|
| 3:56:37| from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14197)|
| 3:56:39| Cindy, out of those numbers, how many were UT students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14199)|
| 3:56:41| when you talked about a daily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14201)|
| 3:56:43| It depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14203)|
| 3:56:45| on the route, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14207)|
| 3:56:49| a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14209)|
| 3:56:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14211)|
| 3:56:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14215)|
| 3:56:57| We heard something earlier today about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14217)|
| 3:56:59| are we using our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14219)|
| 3:57:01| outlying parking lots as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14221)|
| 3:57:03| we could, and especially the ones under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14223)|
| 3:57:05| bridges and those kinds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14225)|
| 3:57:07| places that have been paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14227)|
| 3:57:09| And it was suggested that possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14229)|
| 3:57:11| better or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14231)|
| 3:57:13| more trolley service might make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14233)|
| 3:57:15| people more excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14235)|
| 3:57:17| to use those and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14237)|
| 3:57:19| get around, but park in a free place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| park in an accessible place. Do you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14241)|
| 3:57:23| any idea of how you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14243)|
| 3:57:25| adjust your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14245)|
| 3:57:27| trolley service from those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14247)|
| 3:57:29| outlying parking areas to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14249)|
| 3:57:31| downtown or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14251)|
| 3:57:33| Are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14253)|
| 3:57:35| talking about parking areas that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14255)|
| 3:57:37| adjacent to downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| Like near the Old City, you can go under those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14259)|
| 3:57:41| interstate bridges and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14261)|
| 3:57:43| the Hall of Fame Drive and that kind of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14263)|
| 3:57:45| and park. That may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14265)|
| 3:57:47| too far for some people to go on foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14267)|
| 3:57:49| obviously. Folks young like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14269)|
| 3:57:51| myself can walk. The trolley services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14271)|
| 3:57:53| are fastest growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14273)|
| 3:57:55| portion of ridership, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14275)|
| 3:57:57| of course the trolley service is free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14277)|
| 3:57:59| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14279)|
| 3:58:01| I think it's sort of a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14281)|
| 3:58:03| of build it and they will come. I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14283)|
| 3:58:05| that would happen, but it will increase our costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14285)|
| 3:58:07| considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14287)|
| 3:58:09| So you don't make that much on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14289)|
| 3:58:11| free transportation, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14291)|
| 3:58:13| We lose it quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14293)|
| 3:58:15| on free transportation than we do when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14295)|
| 3:58:17| charge a fare. And a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14297)|
| 3:58:19| of cities don't, well not a lot, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14299)|
| 3:58:21| there are cities who really want the ridership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| and think that the fare box recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14303)|
| 3:58:25| is so nominal that they offer all their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14305)|
| 3:58:27| services free. It's just sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14307)|
| 3:58:29| philosophical way that you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14309)|
| 3:58:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14311)|
| 3:58:35| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14315)|
| 3:58:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14317)|
| 3:58:39| Short and sweet. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14319)|
| 3:58:41| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14321)|
| 3:58:43| believe that takes care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14323)|
| 3:58:45| of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14325)|
| 3:58:51| Well, we'll move to public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14331)|
| 3:58:53| works section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14333)|
| 3:58:55| So we're behind a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14335)|
| 3:58:57| We are behind a little bit. We're going to have to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14337)|

| 3:59:03| on the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14343)|
| 3:59:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14345)|
| 3:59:11| There's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14351)|
| 3:59:19| That's a big group, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14359)|
| 3:59:21| It is a big group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14361)|
| 3:59:23| An esteemed group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14363)|
| 3:59:29| Some would say this is where the rubber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14369)|
| 3:59:31| meets the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14371)|
| 3:59:33| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14373)|
| 3:59:35| The road meets the rubber, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14375)|
| 3:59:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14377)|
| 3:59:39| Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14379)|

| 3:59:45| So you've got the whole public works team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14385)|

| 3:59:51| We can kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14391)|
| 3:59:53| do mass questions or we can break it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14393)|
| 3:59:55| individually. I did want to just introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14395)|
| 3:59:57| a few folks who are with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14397)|
| 3:59:59| Alicia Catlett, if she'll raise her hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14399)|
| 4:00:01| She's our budget and finance for public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14401)|
| 4:00:03| And Chad Weff behind me is our deputy director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14403)|
| 4:00:05| Public service is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14405)|
| 4:00:07| behind the scenes. I always say we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14407)|
| 4:00:09| the core services that touch our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14409)|
| 4:00:11| We have 305| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14411)|
| 4:00:13| employees, a big department like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14413)|
| 4:00:15| police and fire, and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14415)|
| 4:00:17| $33 million operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14417)|
| 4:00:19| budget. It's a flat budget this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14419)|
| 4:00:21| besides the traditional increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14421)|
| 4:00:23| for salaries and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14423)|
| 4:00:25| what Jim handles every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14425)|
| 4:00:27| We do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14427)|
| 4:00:29| $15 million in capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14429)|
| 4:00:31| and that's really focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14431)|
| 4:00:33| new facilities. And Ms. Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14433)|
| 4:00:35| was up here. She talked about technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14435)|
| 4:00:37| I think public service over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14437)|
| 4:00:39| the next two years to three years is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14439)|
| 4:00:41| focused on three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14441)|
| 4:00:43| Integrating technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14443)|
| 4:00:45| a departmental reorganization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| and new facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14447)|
| 4:00:49| We have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14449)|
| 4:00:51| doing the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14451)|
| 4:00:53| We've had the same system in place for over 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14453)|
| 4:00:55| years, and it's worked well, but it's time to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14455)|
| 4:00:57| at that because we have new tools and new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14457)|
| 4:00:59| technology. And so those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14459)|
| 4:01:01| three focus areas we're hoping to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14461)|
| 4:01:03| increase or improve efficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14463)|
| 4:01:05| find efficiencies, increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14465)|
| 4:01:07| our services, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14467)|
| 4:01:09| improve customer service, those three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14469)|
| 4:01:11| And so I'll open it up to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14471)|
| 4:01:13| Obviously, I've got neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14473)|
| 4:01:15| codes as well. Sometimes that pops up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14475)|
| 4:01:17| or any other issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14477)|
| 4:01:19| you may have. I'm just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14479)|
| 4:01:21| curious. I mean, we're talking about the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14481)|
| 4:01:23| facility. I mean, you live it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14483)|
| 4:01:25| What's your take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14485)|
| 4:01:27| What's it going to really benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14487)|
| 4:01:29| What's it going to do for? Yeah, I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14489)|
| 4:01:31| brought this 1978| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14491)|
| 4:01:33| document that talked about us consolidating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14493)|
| 4:01:35| parcels back in the early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14495)|
| 4:01:37| late 70s, early 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| So if you look at that facility, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14499)|
| 4:01:41| was bought. It's the old foot mineral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14501)|
| 4:01:43| property, which was before my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14503)|
| 4:01:45| but it was an industrial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14505)|
| 4:01:47| The city bought it because it was central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14507)|
| 4:01:49| and at that time was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14509)|
| 4:01:51| out towards the western end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| the city, but there was real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14513)|
| 4:01:55| and property there. It was industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14515)|
| 4:01:57| So we repurposed the foot mineral buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14517)|
| 4:01:59| They were built in the 50s. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14519)|
| 4:02:01| our employees, and when you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14521)|
| 4:02:03| Lorain Street, it's not just public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14523)|
| 4:02:05| This complex is not just about service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14525)|
| 4:02:07| It's engineering. It's fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14527)|
| 4:02:09| It's some, you know, occasional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| parks and rec that comes to our warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14531)|
| 4:02:13| and it's engineering. It's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14533)|
| 4:02:15| where many of our design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14535)|
| 4:02:17| customers, architects and engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14537)|
| 4:02:19| come for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14539)|
| 4:02:21| just engineering to get various permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14541)|
| 4:02:23| or to have meetings. So it's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14543)|
| 4:02:25| 300 employees, public works-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14545)|
| 4:02:27| employees, who come to very antiquated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14547)|
| 4:02:29| facilities on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14549)|
| 4:02:31| And so those antiquated facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14551)|
| 4:02:33| obviously affect culture and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14553)|
| 4:02:35| production, but more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14555)|
| 4:02:37| those same facilities also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14557)|
| 4:02:39| have high utility costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14559)|
| 4:02:41| I looked at the utilities. We spend about $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14561)|
| 4:02:43| a year just on utilities at Lorain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14563)|
| 4:02:45| Street. That's only in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14565)|
| 4:02:47| service. That doesn't include what engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14567)|
| 4:02:49| customers need. Right now, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14569)|
| 4:02:51| a separated fleet services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14571)|
| 4:02:53| department. The heavy shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14573)|
| 4:02:55| which is the big trucks and the fire trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14575)|
| 4:02:57| are serviced at Lorain Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14577)|
| 4:02:59| All the other vehicles are serviced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14579)|
| 4:03:01| at Prosser Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14581)|
| 4:03:03| and so there's a split system there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14583)|
| 4:03:05| where you've got support staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14585)|
| 4:03:07| that have to do support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14587)|
| 4:03:09| supplies and materials and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14589)|
| 4:03:11| finance. A duplication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14591)|
| 4:03:13| A duplication of those services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14593)|
| 4:03:15| and so that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14595)|
| 4:03:17| We've also got millions of dollars worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14597)|
| 4:03:19| of equipment that sits out 24-7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14599)|
| 4:03:21| and has no cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14601)|
| 4:03:23| And so the combination of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14603)|
| 4:03:25| are really why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14605)|
| 4:03:27| this facility is important. It's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14607)|
| 4:03:29| a priority for, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14609)|
| 4:03:31| for me, but for previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14611)|
| 4:03:33| public works, public service administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14613)|
| 4:03:35| This actually started, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14615)|
| 4:03:37| they've been looking at this property since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14617)|
| 4:03:39| late 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14619)|
| 4:03:41| Bob Wetzel, when he was the public service director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14621)|
| 4:03:43| started slowly buying properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14623)|
| 4:03:45| But really what brought it all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14625)|
| 4:03:47| was in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14627)|
| 4:03:49| Benfield Richters was hired by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14629)|
| 4:03:51| the city to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14631)|
| 4:03:53| ideas for fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14633)|
| 4:03:55| public service and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14635)|
| 4:03:57| There were some ideas that fleet may buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14637)|
| 4:03:59| an old or a closed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14639)|
| 4:04:01| auto center out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14641)|
| 4:04:03| Clinton Highway, and there was discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14643)|
| 4:04:05| about getting fleet all in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14645)|
| 4:04:07| location, and so we hired a design firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14647)|
| 4:04:09| to look at all of our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14649)|
| 4:04:11| Some of those facilities we knew had critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14651)|
| 4:04:13| needs, health and safety needs, so they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14653)|
| 4:04:15| a critical facilities report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14655)|
| 4:04:17| They also looked at all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| our facilities, and again, the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14659)|
| 4:04:21| was consolidate at Lorain Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14661)|
| 4:04:23| replace two or three of the key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14663)|
| 4:04:25| buildings, and you'll gain significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14665)|
| 4:04:27| efficiencies from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14667)|
| 4:04:29| And so we have not, I guess what we have submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14669)|
| 4:04:31| is a very basic request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14671)|
| 4:04:33| You know, the original plan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14673)|
| 4:04:35| over $23 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14675)|
| 4:04:37| We value engineered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14677)|
| 4:04:39| that down to get a very basic request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14679)|
| 4:04:41| that will provide good services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14681)|
| 4:04:43| excuse me, good location for our employees to come to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14683)|
| 4:04:45| that will cover our equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14685)|
| 4:04:47| that will improve the utilities and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14687)|
| 4:04:49| efficiencies from a utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14689)|
| 4:04:51| perspective, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14691)|
| 4:04:53| will be a place where our design customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14693)|
| 4:04:55| again, oftentimes engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14695)|
| 4:04:57| and architects come to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14697)|
| 4:04:59| with engineering when they come down to Lorain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14699)|
| 4:05:01| Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14701)|
| 4:05:03| If I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14703)|
| 4:05:05| I'd like to throw in a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14705)|
| 4:05:07| anecdote on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14707)|
| 4:05:09| We had a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14709)|
| 4:05:11| one of our engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14711)|
| 4:05:13| was entering his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14713)|
| 4:05:15| office on Lorain Street, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14715)|
| 4:05:17| thought somebody was playing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14717)|
| 4:05:19| a trick on him, but it turned out it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14719)|
| 4:05:21| a real live black snake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14721)|
| 4:05:23| that was wrapped around his doorknob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14723)|
| 4:05:25| We've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14725)|
| 4:05:27| the building is old, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14727)|
| 4:05:29| it's very accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14729)|
| 4:05:31| We came in one morning, and there was a raccoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14731)|
| 4:05:33| that had gotten into the Gatorade in one of our rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14733)|
| 4:05:35| so if you want to see an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14735)|
| 4:05:37| excited raccoon, have him eat about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14737)|
| 4:05:39| two gallons worth of Gatorade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14739)|
| 4:05:41| But the facility is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14741)|
| 4:05:43| antiquated. Is that the mascot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14743)|
| 4:05:45| for the group? It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14745)|
| 4:05:47| We'll let that be for engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14747)|
| 4:05:49| It is antiquated. It doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14749)|
| 4:05:51| meet fire code or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14751)|
| 4:05:53| accessibility code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14753)|
| 4:05:55| There are many locations in the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14755)|
| 4:05:57| where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14757)|
| 4:05:59| a non-competing, or excuse me, a non-compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14759)|
| 4:06:01| use. The tire shop butts up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14761)|
| 4:06:03| one of our meeting rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14763)|
| 4:06:05| The small engine shop for fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| is connected to one of our rooms, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14767)|
| 4:06:09| if they're running equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14769)|
| 4:06:11| there's carbon monoxide issues. We've tried to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14771)|
| 4:06:13| address that. So there's just lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14773)|
| 4:06:15| of issues that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14775)|
| 4:06:17| this has been an ongoing request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14777)|
| 4:06:19| It's not something that just popped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14779)|
| 4:06:21| out of thin air. We've been working on it for over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14781)|
| 4:06:23| ten years, and obviously other folks have looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14783)|
| 4:06:25| for many years, so I think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14785)|
| 4:06:27| a good plan. It's not a fluffy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14787)|
| 4:06:29| It's a very basic, practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14789)|
| 4:06:31| design. I think we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14791)|
| 4:06:33| a lot of design and try to highlight many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14793)|
| 4:06:35| the environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14795)|
| 4:06:37| benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14797)|
| 4:06:39| that our engineering folks preach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14799)|
| 4:06:41| every day in stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14801)|
| 4:06:43| and obviously Mayor O'Hara has an interest in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14803)|
| 4:06:45| as well, and so we're going to look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14805)|
| 4:06:47| and look at LEED practices and principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14807)|
| 4:06:49| as we go into the design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14809)|
| 4:06:51| Now, Samuel Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14811)|
| 4:06:53| your timeline is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14813)|
| 4:06:55| And then, what are you going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14815)|
| 4:06:57| tear down the buildings you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14817)|
| 4:06:59| Yeah, I mean, the Benefield Rectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14819)|
| 4:07:01| plan was, and I know this is overused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14821)|
| 4:07:03| you know, it's at the 10,000 foot level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14823)|
| 4:07:05| so we are very close to coming to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14825)|
| 4:07:07| to counsel with a contract with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14827)|
| 4:07:09| designer, an architecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14829)|
| 4:07:11| firm, an engineering team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14831)|
| 4:07:13| that will be the team that will start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14833)|
| 4:07:15| to program, so we've got to get out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14835)|
| 4:07:17| clouds and get down on the ground, so they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14837)|
| 4:07:19| do programming. That will take several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14839)|
| 4:07:21| They will then start working on design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14841)|
| 4:07:23| documents, schematic design, final design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14843)|
| 4:07:25| construction documents, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14845)|
| 4:07:27| we'll go out to bid for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14847)|
| 4:07:29| So, there is a key large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14849)|
| 4:07:31| building that we hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14851)|
| 4:07:33| that needs to be replaced, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14853)|
| 4:07:35| we will consolidate parcels. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14855)|
| 4:07:37| spent the last couple of years purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14857)|
| 4:07:39| and acquiring these individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14859)|
| 4:07:41| parcels. Those will be one-lotted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14861)|
| 4:07:43| and then we will build a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14863)|
| 4:07:45| large building, and that is very conceptual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14865)|
| 4:07:47| at this time. As Mr. Greave knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14867)|
| 4:07:49| as an architect, it's just the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14869)|
| 4:07:51| concept of what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14871)|
| 4:07:53| That building will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14873)|
| 4:07:55| constructed. This building will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14875)|
| 4:07:57| be torn down where we are now, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14877)|
| 4:07:59| fleet building will be built, and we'll consolidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14879)|
| 4:08:01| fleet. So, it's kind of a leapfrog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14881)|
| 4:08:03| We've got to get out of this building into a new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14883)|
| 4:08:05| tear it down, then get fleet built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14885)|
| 4:08:07| and then fleet can consolidate in one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14887)|
| 4:08:09| Those are key. Two phases? What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14889)|
| 4:08:11| Two phases, then another one? Yeah, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14891)|
| 4:08:13| to three phases. There's some discussion, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14893)|
| 4:08:15| about, you know, do we renovate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14895)|
| 4:08:17| engineering building, or do we try to bring them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14897)|
| 4:08:19| in while we're mobilizing equipment on-site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14899)|
| 4:08:21| and try to get everybody into one new building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14901)|
| 4:08:23| Obviously, we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14903)|
| 4:08:25| real budget, and we have to be respectful of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14905)|
| 4:08:27| and our customers, but we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14907)|
| 4:08:29| want to try to maximize what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14909)|
| 4:08:31| and maximize efficiencies. It would be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| to consolidate all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14913)|
| 4:08:35| engineering's resources. Budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14915)|
| 4:08:37| will limit some of that, but we're going to, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14917)|
| 4:08:39| we'll value engineering and back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14919)|
| 4:08:41| off our ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14921)|
| 4:08:43| You know, traffic engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14923)|
| 4:08:45| the sign and signal shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14925)|
| 4:08:47| some of those folks are located at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14927)|
| 4:08:49| Elm Street and some very old buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14929)|
| 4:08:51| and again, trying to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14931)|
| 4:08:53| folks when they're off-site can be a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14933)|
| 4:08:55| challenging, so if we can get those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14935)|
| 4:08:57| down to Lorain Street, that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14937)|
| 4:08:59| be the ideal, but again, some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14939)|
| 4:09:01| it's going to be driven by budget, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14941)|
| 4:09:03| we obviously know we have to stay within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14943)|
| 4:09:05| All right, we've got more to come on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14945)|
| 4:09:07| Councilman Campin. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14947)|
| 4:09:09| I'm sure you would have thrown this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14949)|
| 4:09:11| number out if you had an idea, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14951)|
| 4:09:13| what kind of efficiencies or savings in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14953)|
| 4:09:15| energy, time, equipment, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14955)|
| 4:09:17| is there any cost or dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14957)|
| 4:09:19| figure you could throw out that you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14959)|
| 4:09:21| get annually from this construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14961)|
| 4:09:23| Yeah, and I won't be able to do that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14963)|
| 4:09:25| We do hope, as we get the designer on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14965)|
| 4:09:27| board, we know that there's efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14967)|
| 4:09:29| We know that our equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14969)|
| 4:09:31| sitting out in UV light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14971)|
| 4:09:33| and weather 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14973)|
| 4:09:35| especially diesel equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14975)|
| 4:09:37| it's not healthy for it, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14977)|
| 4:09:39| generators and our leaf trucks and our salt spreaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14979)|
| 4:09:41| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14981)|
| 4:09:43| our anticipation is that as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14983)|
| 4:09:45| designers get on board, they'll be able to start to get their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14985)|
| 4:09:47| arms around that. Again, we do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14987)|
| 4:09:49| that we have very leaky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14989)|
| 4:09:51| buildings, very inefficient buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14991)|
| 4:09:53| $100,000 a year, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14993)|
| 4:09:55| as the designers get on board, we hope to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14995)|
| 4:09:57| bring you some numbers and show you some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14997)|
| 4:09:59| specifically. And then there's the intangibles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=14999)|
| 4:10:01| of just having a professional place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15001)|
| 4:10:03| go to work. Having a training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15003)|
| 4:10:05| room, we don't have a very good place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15005)|
| 4:10:07| to train employees. We have 305| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15007)|
| 4:10:09| employees and we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15009)|
| 4:10:11| computer access for many of those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15011)|
| 4:10:13| Again, Ms. Wright talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15013)|
| 4:10:15| the AVL system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15015)|
| 4:10:17| and I wanted to jump up when she was talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15017)|
| 4:10:19| We've been collecting brush the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15019)|
| 4:10:21| for over 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15021)|
| 4:10:23| and I know through technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15023)|
| 4:10:25| we can get more efficient. Our current system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15025)|
| 4:10:27| requires us to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15027)|
| 4:10:29| every street. We have subzones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15029)|
| 4:10:31| in each area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15031)|
| 4:10:33| and we drive every street in that zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15033)|
| 4:10:35| looking for brush. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15035)|
| 4:10:37| a big truck, that's a big diesel truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15037)|
| 4:10:39| that gets wear and tear and fuel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15039)|
| 4:10:41| and there's some communities that have call-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15041)|
| 4:10:43| and where it's called in into a 3-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15043)|
| 4:10:45| system that Mr. Jensen would manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15045)|
| 4:10:47| and then it's plotted in a software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15047)|
| 4:10:49| and your route, your most efficient route for collecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15049)|
| 4:10:51| at the next day is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15051)|
| 4:10:53| based on technology. There's another way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15053)|
| 4:10:55| where you would take a little Prius and drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15055)|
| 4:10:57| these subzones the day before and hit a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15057)|
| 4:10:59| button every time you went by a pile and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15059)|
| 4:11:01| the next day you would have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15061)|
| 4:11:03| here's your route, this is the most efficient route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15063)|
| 4:11:05| based on technology, based on software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15065)|
| 4:11:07| So that's the kind of stuff that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15067)|
| 4:11:09| want to work towards. We know we can be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15069)|
| 4:11:11| efficient but we need, again, the software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15071)|
| 4:11:13| system we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15073)|
| 4:11:15| has been around since I believe the early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15075)|
| 4:11:17| 90's and so it's very paper-driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15077)|
| 4:11:19| it's not, if I need to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15079)|
| 4:11:21| where a work order is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15081)|
| 4:11:23| I have to call down to Lorain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15083)|
| 4:11:25| Street and get a response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15085)|
| 4:11:27| on it, I can't pull it up on a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15087)|
| 4:11:29| so I jumped around a little bit but those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15089)|
| 4:11:31| are the things we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15091)|
| 4:11:33| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15093)|
| 4:11:35| I was just wondering as you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15095)|
| 4:11:37| talking about consolidating operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15097)|
| 4:11:39| from several locations and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15099)|
| 4:11:41| mentioned the Prosser Road fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15101)|
| 4:11:43| repair thing and the Elm Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15103)|
| 4:11:45| will there end up being surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15105)|
| 4:11:47| property where you can recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15107)|
| 4:11:49| some value by selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15109)|
| 4:11:51| it or getting rid of it somehow or other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15111)|
| 4:11:53| Yeah, Prosser Road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15113)|
| 4:11:55| on a former dump site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15115)|
| 4:11:57| and so I don't think we'll ever get rid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15117)|
| 4:11:59| of anything at Prosser Road and there's also a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15119)|
| 4:12:01| you know the fire department... It could be your amphibious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15121)|
| 4:12:03| street if you had a fleet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15123)|
| 4:12:05| Yeah, it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15125)|
| 4:12:07| former, you know, it's a landfill, a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15127)|
| 4:12:09| where materials were deposited many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15129)|
| 4:12:11| ago and so it's capped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15131)|
| 4:12:13| and it's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15133)|
| 4:12:15| And there's a need, the advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15135)|
| 4:12:17| to moving fleet, one, is it's all in one location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15137)|
| 4:12:19| one part shop, support staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15139)|
| 4:12:21| there's efficiencies there. The fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15141)|
| 4:12:23| also has a real need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15143)|
| 4:12:25| storing some of their technical equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15145)|
| 4:12:27| their spare engines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15147)|
| 4:12:29| Right now they've got that just, you know, kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15149)|
| 4:12:31| out throughout the community in different fire stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15151)|
| 4:12:33| where they can find it. Some of it sits out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15153)|
| 4:12:35| the police department has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15155)|
| 4:12:37| trailers and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15157)|
| 4:12:39| So if you vacate the light shop, you're now going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15159)|
| 4:12:41| a building that can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15161)|
| 4:12:43| for storage. It could get some of that expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15163)|
| 4:12:45| multi-million dollar fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15165)|
| 4:12:47| equipment indoors for storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15167)|
| 4:12:49| where it's better on it and more secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15169)|
| 4:12:51| Now the Elm Street facility, we'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15171)|
| 4:12:53| look at that and look at its history from an environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15173)|
| 4:12:55| perspective, but I mean that may be a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15175)|
| 4:12:57| if we vacate it that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15177)|
| 4:12:59| surplused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15179)|
| 4:13:01| Obviously, with what Joe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15181)|
| 4:13:03| may talk about with Lakeshore, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15183)|
| 4:13:05| Fifth Avenue site was ever vacated, that may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15185)|
| 4:13:07| that's an older building that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15187)|
| 4:13:09| potentially in the future could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15189)|
| 4:13:11| vacated. So yes, are we looking at that? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15191)|
| 4:13:15| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15195)|
| 4:13:17| David, I may have missed this, but are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15197)|
| 4:13:19| folks going to be handling the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15199)|
| 4:13:21| design contract and the construction contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15201)|
| 4:13:23| for this new building or is it going to be turned over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15203)|
| 4:13:25| PBA? Right now it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15205)|
| 4:13:27| in our shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15207)|
| 4:13:29| Right now it's in our shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15209)|
| 4:13:31| I don't know if Eddie or Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15211)|
| 4:13:33| want to look into that, but right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15213)|
| 4:13:35| it's in our shop. We bid it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15215)|
| 4:13:37| We did an RFQ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15217)|
| 4:13:39| and then an RFP, so we'll come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15219)|
| 4:13:41| council with a contract between the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15221)|
| 4:13:43| and us. I mean that could change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| but right now it's between us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15225)|
| 4:13:47| and the architect directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15227)|
| 4:13:49| No decisions have been made as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15229)|
| 4:13:51| whether we want to try to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15231)|
| 4:13:53| vertical builds with PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15233)|
| 4:13:55| or whether we're going to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15235)|
| 4:13:57| bid them out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15237)|
| 4:13:59| normal course of things. Right now we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15239)|
| 4:14:01| just want to get an architect on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15241)|
| 4:14:03| board and get the design out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15243)|
| 4:14:05| there. Frankly, we haven't thought that far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15245)|
| 4:14:07| through it yet, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15247)|
| 4:14:09| Thank you. Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15249)|
| 4:14:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15251)|
| 4:14:13| This is more a philosophical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15253)|
| 4:14:15| statement probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15255)|
| 4:14:17| In all this consolidating, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15257)|
| 4:14:19| am very much in favor of, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15259)|
| 4:14:21| we ought to take all the operations we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15261)|
| 4:14:23| and consolidate them and squeeze all the efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15263)|
| 4:14:25| out that are possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15265)|
| 4:14:27| It seems to me, though, philosophically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15267)|
| 4:14:29| that other entities in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15269)|
| 4:14:31| other governmental entities, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15271)|
| 4:14:33| the county, that essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15273)|
| 4:14:35| have the same function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15275)|
| 4:14:37| They've got vehicles to repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15277)|
| 4:14:39| fleets to manage, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15279)|
| 4:14:41| I've often wondered why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15281)|
| 4:14:43| we can't consolidate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15283)|
| 4:14:45| functions. They're essentially the same function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15285)|
| 4:14:47| A car is a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15287)|
| 4:14:49| A fire truck is a fire truck, except they don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15289)|
| 4:14:51| fire trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15291)|
| 4:14:55| I'll just lay it there. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15295)|
| 4:14:57| if Mr. Hines wants to take a stab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15297)|
| 4:14:59| at making a response or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15299)|
| 4:15:01| but to begin to consolidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15301)|
| 4:15:03| some of our services and save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15303)|
| 4:15:05| some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15305)|
| 4:15:07| What did you say? Take a stab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15307)|
| 4:15:09| at making a response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15309)|
| 4:15:11| I guess the first motion toward the stab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15311)|
| 4:15:13| is it's always a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15313)|
| 4:15:15| difficult, even though to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15315)|
| 4:15:17| two different entities of separate budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| cycles into that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15319)|
| 4:15:21| but believe me, it's something we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15321)|
| 4:15:23| about and engage in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15323)|
| 4:15:25| quite often, and the logic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15325)|
| 4:15:27| of what you said is pretty unassailable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15327)|
| 4:15:33| Further questions? Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15333)|
| 4:15:35| Palmer. Well, in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15335)|
| 4:15:37| to Councilman Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15337)|
| 4:15:39| I've always thought that consolidation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15339)|
| 4:15:41| was going to reduce expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15341)|
| 4:15:43| and we need to look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15343)|
| 4:15:45| things, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15345)|
| 4:15:47| in looking at some places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15347)|
| 4:15:49| in our own state and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15349)|
| 4:15:51| beyond, the initial savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15351)|
| 4:15:53| is great, but the long term is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15353)|
| 4:15:55| there. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15355)|
| 4:15:57| I always think you really need to think seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15357)|
| 4:15:59| about where you're going with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15359)|
| 4:16:01| A discussion for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15361)|
| 4:16:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15363)|
| 4:16:05| I would point out that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15365)|
| 4:16:07| there are certain activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15367)|
| 4:16:09| that the city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15369)|
| 4:16:11| the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15371)|
| 4:16:13| do jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15373)|
| 4:16:15| For example, we missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15375)|
| 4:16:17| risk here earlier, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15377)|
| 4:16:19| we've been able to pool insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15379)|
| 4:16:21| We've looked at a variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15381)|
| 4:16:23| of things, usually those are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15383)|
| 4:16:25| inside what I'd call the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15385)|
| 4:16:27| county mayor's office, because again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15387)|
| 4:16:29| just because you're well aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15389)|
| 4:16:31| of the county structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15391)|
| 4:16:33| has a much different structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15393)|
| 4:16:35| which complicates things immensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15395)|
| 4:16:37| But we are always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15397)|
| 4:16:39| have certain things on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15399)|
| 4:16:41| our plate that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15401)|
| 4:16:43| look at, and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15403)|
| 4:16:45| discussions, you know, they never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15405)|
| 4:16:47| rise, I guess, to your level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15407)|
| 4:16:49| until we were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15409)|
| 4:16:51| kind of bring those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15411)|
| 4:16:53| to fruition. But there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15413)|
| 4:16:55| are things where we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15415)|
| 4:16:57| combined savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15417)|
| 4:16:59| and we'll address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15419)|
| 4:17:01| those where we think they're legitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15421)|
| 4:17:03| savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15423)|
| 4:17:05| Councilman? Yes, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15425)|
| 4:17:07| you. David or Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15427)|
| 4:17:09| Hagerman, have we looked at other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15429)|
| 4:17:11| cities that are doing a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15431)|
| 4:17:13| with their public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15433)|
| 4:17:15| fleet type stuff? In other words, have we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15435)|
| 4:17:17| looked at models where things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15437)|
| 4:17:19| are done really well and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15439)|
| 4:17:21| we hope to be that good kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15441)|
| 4:17:23| Yeah, we've been very fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15443)|
| 4:17:25| Mr. Hagerman and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15445)|
| 4:17:27| are both members of the Tennessee chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15447)|
| 4:17:29| of the American Public Works Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15449)|
| 4:17:31| The APWA is the national group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15451)|
| 4:17:33| The city of Alcoa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15453)|
| 4:17:35| Kenny Wiggins, is their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15455)|
| 4:17:37| public works director is an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15457)|
| 4:17:39| They're about four years ahead of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15459)|
| 4:17:41| so they went through a very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15461)|
| 4:17:43| process of identifying a need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15463)|
| 4:17:45| doing a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15465)|
| 4:17:47| doing property acquisition, and then building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15467)|
| 4:17:49| a facility and consolidating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15469)|
| 4:17:51| multiple divisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15471)|
| 4:17:53| within. They have a track record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15473)|
| 4:17:55| you're saying? Yeah, and I would love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15475)|
| 4:17:57| if any of the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15477)|
| 4:17:59| want to go do a tour of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15479)|
| 4:18:01| It was, again, Mr. Wiggins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15481)|
| 4:18:03| is a very frugal, customer-oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15483)|
| 4:18:05| engineer, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15485)|
| 4:18:07| they built a great facility, but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15487)|
| 4:18:09| not the Taj Mahal. It's a very operational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15489)|
| 4:18:11| functional facility, but it's professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15491)|
| 4:18:13| I would love to take any of you on a tour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15493)|
| 4:18:15| out there, and I'm sure Mr. Wiggins would be more than happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15495)|
| 4:18:17| So, they have done it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15497)|
| 4:18:19| in Alcoa, and we've watched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15499)|
| 4:18:21| them do it. Again, they're about four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15501)|
| 4:18:23| ahead of us, but we've been on fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15503)|
| 4:18:25| similar paths, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15505)|
| 4:18:27| they went ahead and got it into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15507)|
| 4:18:29| end zone a few years earlier, but it is a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15509)|
| 4:18:31| facility. If you'd ever love to go out and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15511)|
| 4:18:33| or like to go out there and look at it, we'll get a tour for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15513)|
| 4:18:35| And if you ever want to come see our Lorain Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15515)|
| 4:18:37| facilities, I know some of you have been down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15517)|
| 4:18:39| We'll be glad to get you around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15519)|
| 4:18:41| Lorain Street as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15521)|
| 4:18:43| All right. For the sake of time, we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15523)|
| 4:18:45| drop this and go ahead to Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15525)|
| 4:18:47| I mean, David's always available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15527)|
| 4:18:49| for anyone, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15529)|
| 4:18:51| need to keep on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15531)|
| 4:18:53| the time schedule here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15533)|
| 4:18:59| Mr. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15539)|
| 4:19:01| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15541)|
| 4:19:03| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15543)|
| 4:19:05| Following Public Works, and I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15545)|
| 4:19:07| makes sense for us to go after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15547)|
| 4:19:09| Public Works because we work very closely together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=15549)|
