| 0:08:54| The current operator does have a license, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| That will have to be surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=536)|

| 0:09:16| And who will be operating this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=556)|

| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=580)|

| 0:09:47| You must pay for a permit, pick up a permit, and pass a final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| Sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| I've had a lot of trouble from this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| Can you talk into the microphone, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| That one's dead, Woofie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Step up there to the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| This is one of my nightmare stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| I think last month we counted about nine times they'd been cited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| and I'd just like this gentleman to understand that we'll be checking him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| Mr. Chairman, Captain Mays, is he still pending something in the eyes of the sheriff, or he's okay, just stay okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=628)|
| 0:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| I'll make a motion with the pendings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| But I want to reiterate what Captain Mays has said, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| It has been a problem location, and every time he's out, he will check you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| So make sure that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| And you have to get your – before the license for him, you'll have to get your certificate of server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=657)|
| 0:11:05| Anybody that works there that sells has to have a certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| You must be in full compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| That store has a history of noncompliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| That's one of the reasons why Racetrack Petroleum has kicked the current operator out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| He's been there for six, seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| So – but it's on the radar, so just be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| I actually have – I just want to put this on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| I actually have a couple businesses in Anderson County for the past five years, and we have had zero problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Motion was with all the pendings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| And seeing no further discussion then, the motion is properly before us, pending final inspection of health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=702)|
| 0:11:50| final on fire, pick – I mean pay and pick up the final on code, and have server training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=710)|
| 0:12:02| surrender the existing current certificate, and have a certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| When those items are all checked off, we'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| That's the motion that's before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Good luck in your endeavor, Mr. Patel, and please do not come back and visit with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=746)|

| 0:13:43| I do not, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| What's your relationship with the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Are you leasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=828)|

| 0:14:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| And who will be operating this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=845)|

| 0:14:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Are you familiar with the Knox County, Tennessee beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=849)|

| 0:14:24| I'm going to ask the staff some questions at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=864)|

| 0:14:34| Thank you, Captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| Yes, I'd like to make a motion that we accept his application pending his server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| Business tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Business tax and a certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| Certificate of registration and business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Is that all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| And I recognize the light down on the end, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Mr. Jones, your business is going to open at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| but you're going to sell beer to people who leave this location but not at catered events, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| The permit is to not sell any alcohol at this location but solely offsite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| So you're going to only sell your beer at catered events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| That's okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Isn't it when you all have, say, weddings and a reception after a wedding, and they're catering the wedding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=941)|
| 0:15:51| if there's any alcohol or beer served, they have to pay a, I guess, say, bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=951)|
| 0:16:00| So you all are actually providing the alcohol and you're being the bartender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| so they're not paying extra to hire different people to come in and serve, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| We're fully insured by our insurance company to serve liquor at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| The application would be for us to have the proper permitting to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=987)|

| 0:23:38| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| We are at a point of the agenda this evening called public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| and I take a point of personal privilege this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| to recognize my representative at state legislature, Representative Harry Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1431)|
| 0:24:05| Representative Brooks received his Bachelor of Arts in Speech and Communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| from Carson Newman College in 1969.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| He's worked as a teacher, counselor, and administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| He is a member of Knox County School Board 1992 to 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1459)|
| 0:24:26| He was elected to the state legislature of Tennessee in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| In this current session, he's the chair of the Education, Administration, and Planning Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| a member of the Education, Instruction, and Program Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| a member of the ever-powerful Calendar and Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| His work for us here in Knox County or in East Tennessee does not stop with the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| He is also chair of the Board of Trustees, Carson Newman College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| and locally on Washington Pike where he resides, and I get to drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| I have the privilege of driving by his house to and from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| He's the chair of Union Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| I'll call it he's the chair of the Building Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Does that be correct maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| That's close enough, of which they are involved in a rather large undertaking of how to have daycare here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1521)|
| 0:25:35| But the most important thing and the reason that I pause us tonight to recognize Representative Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| as a part of resolution that's on consent, it's 218, it's on page 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1542)|
| 0:25:52| is that Representative Brooks in the amount of $19,000 plus to Gibbs High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1552)|
| 0:26:02| No, see I can't even read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| $19,000 plus to Carter High School, $25,000 plus to Gibbs High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| $10,000 a piece for Halls and South Doyle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Representative Brooks has taken his campaign funds and made significant contributions to these four high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1577)|
| 0:26:28| because they're in his district and because he's in education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| and because he's wanting to help us here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| So having said that, please, Representative Brooks, if you would approach the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| and bring your lovely wife with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| Thank you, Miss Mary, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Superintendent of Schools, would you please come down if you have words to say, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| Superintendent of Schools, Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| You said a mouthful there about Harry and the only couple things I could add is I've known Harry a long, long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| I think he was working for the Sheriff's Department when I first met Harry and worked with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| and had an opportunity to balance budgets, fight for the money between education, Sheriff's Department and law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| Harry always won, got all the money, but we made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| But Harry's been a friend of Knox County Schools forever and ever, and not just Knox County Schools, but the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| all the school districts in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Harry's been a proponent for students and educational systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| and we just appreciate Harry and the time that he's served, and we're going to miss him greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| And just the gifts that he gave our four high schools, so wonderful and such a surprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| and we're looking forward to seeing what those schools do with those funds to benefit the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| the constituents that serve in Harry's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| So again, on behalf of Knox County Schools and on behalf of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| I just would like to say publicly thank you to Harry for the donations that he gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| and also for the service that he's given so long to not only to Knox County, but to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1701)|
| 0:28:29| And continuing for just a second, I see a discussion or a line here on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Representative Brooks, I just want to take this opportunity to say thank you for the school in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1719)|
| 0:28:47| Halls High School, that you gave that money to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| It's very much appreciated, and what you've done in Dave Wright's area with his schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1730)|
| 0:28:59| but that one in this district, I want to say that the people out there really do appreciate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| and they want to just say thank you for all you did for that high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| Representative, I see another light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| Commissioner Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| And I simply want to acknowledge not only your gift, but the impact of your dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| and the contribution they will go to making our schools much stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| And I want to say thank you on behalf of South Doyle High School, Carter High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| which is where I used to take, and your contributions to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| I just want to say thank you for the Gap Creek, Kimberlin Heights, and the Bonnie Kaye community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| for your great service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Mr. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| Representative Brooks, could I ask you for comments, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| I don't want to belabor your all's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| I know you've got some issues that are in front of you, but I first, my wife and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| she's been a great partner in these many years in the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| and in other activities with the school board and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| It's fun to discuss with her the issues as they come about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| and we've always had some good discussions, especially dealing with education issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| But thank you for your kind words and your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| We basically took the ratio of the 19th legislative district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| and divided up the ratio with the various high school zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| and that's how we arrived at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| The election commission helped me develop that ratio when we just then multiplied it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| and it arrived at that particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| But I appreciate your service to this community, and y'all do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1859)|
| 0:31:09| And this school board, our schools in this county, is the best metropolitan system in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1869)|
| 0:31:18| I know there are times we have our local issues, but I will tell you, folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| we've got it good in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| We're always looking to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| We're always looking to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| But our teachers and our students and our leadership team here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| has done a good job over multiple years from that standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| and they will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| With your leadership and the school board's leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| tomorrow is going to be brighter than today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| But thank you for your kind comments, and I appreciate the recognition with the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| Please stand there for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| I can notice people here on the raised floor because they have lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| I'm going to have to get Mayor Burchett a light placed on his helmet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| so that when he turns his helmet light on, he can come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| I served in the legislature with Representative Brooks and Mr. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| and I want you to know when somebody said something that Harry was doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| I said, I think I just said that's very obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| Because during legislative session, you know, we sort of pit things urban against rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| and Democrats against Republicans, and Harry was always a level head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| And I'll tell you, he always, when we talk about the least amongst us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| that was always his concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| And that shows in this and the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| And when Harry spoke, he spoke with authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| and he wasn't one of those we used to say had a spring on his seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| He didn't say a lot, but when he did, people listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| And this is just indicative of his career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| and I think we owe him a very large debt of gratitude past the amount of money that he gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| which is substantial, but I think it just shows the quality of person he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| A little known fact, while some of the wilder ones, like Bill Dunn, lived in motels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| Harry actually brought a camper down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| He and his wife, they camped down in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| People don't realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| I never got out from under that tent under the bridge overpass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| but Harry was exceptional, and he'll be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| And again, thank you, Representative Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2019)|
| 0:34:01| As stated earlier, I said we were in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| There are six items on public forum this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| The next item, Sir Charles, Commissioner Bussler, describe those rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2047)|
| 0:34:21| These rocks are called kindness rocks, and they were made by the, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2061)|
| 0:34:29| thank you, Mr. Chair, for recognizing these rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| They're made by the middle school eighth grade class in, not during class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2074)|
| 0:34:43| but anyway, they're made to show people the brightness of some days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2083)|
| 0:34:53| the brightness in the community, and to encourage people to be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| I thought this was really good when they were showing me these pictures of these rocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| and I had to give them recognition, and I told them, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| I'm so proud of these rocks that I was going to have them on my dais for them to see it on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| Now, in a roundabout way, these rocks, and I hate to give him credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| but Mayor Burchett, in a way, had something, well, he didn't have anything to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| but his mother taught the teacher, that's the teacher of this class, to do this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2130)|
| 0:35:39| So I found out that probably the mother was the really mainstay in that family and not the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2139)|
| 0:35:47| So then anyway, I had to give comment to that that it was from her mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| Now, this is a homeroom class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Like I said, not during class do they do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| So that's what that is, and if somebody needs one of these rocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| wants to take it up and put it in their community and let it be passed on for kindness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| for a brighter day and a brightness for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| you're welcome to have one of these rocks to take with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| and where they can pass it on into your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| Is there a present of Mr. Driscoll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Please, sir, come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| I need your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Okay, my name is Thomas Driscoll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Most people know me as Tommy Driscoll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| I live at 609 Coram Road in East Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2194)|
| 0:36:44| Should I start with what I've got to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Yes, sir, and please try to help us with five minutes or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Let's see, before the groundbreaking of the new Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| and his inspector, Jack Paul, came to my house and stole 12 of my vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| I was 100% within the law of Knox County at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| They came two or three times, but the last time they came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| they had me arrested on a bogus warrant out of Jefferson County that had already been resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2237)|
| 0:37:25| and held in jail until a Chestnut Street garage could come up and steal 12 of my cars on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2245)|
| 0:37:36| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| They left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| They took the best ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| I had them in a fenced-in area, eight-foot sheet metal fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| so they were not visible from anyone else's property or the county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| They took the best ones and left the least ones, and I was in jail until about 7 o'clock that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2271)|
| 0:38:00| They picked me up about 9 o'clock that morning, and I guess it took them that long to haul off 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| but they didn't come back and get the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| You know, if any of them were in violation, they were all in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| Several of them were tagged as antiques and registered as antiques,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| especially a 1982 Grumman bus that was used during the World's Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| and some of the cars in the bus had personal property stored in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| I talked to Mayor Burchett at the groundbreaking of Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| and handed him a package of material that explained the whole situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| and he said he would look into it, and as of today, I haven't heard from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| Shortly after it happened, but before I talked to Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| I spoke with Dave Wright, who represented my district at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2338)|
| 0:39:07| and he said, yeah, I'll call you back and we'll talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| And as of today, I haven't heard from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| I filed a complaint in federal court by myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| and of course that was a scam and a sham and a waste of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| but I did it anyway, just so I could say I did, because I knew what was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| But let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| I'd like to get compensated for my property that was stolen, because it was a criminal activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2376)|
| 0:39:46| and I might need one of those rocks the gentleman has over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| But I'll get more detail on what happened and how it happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| and come back next month and give you all the whole story of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2397)|
| 0:40:06| But it depends on who you are, not just in this county or this state, but in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| as to how you get treated or mistreated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| In closing today, I'm not interested in being set up for any false criminal charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| or being arrested or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| I'm not interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| My dogs are not interested in that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| I live with my dogs, live by myself, on four and a half acres, basically secluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| and the cars were located on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Well, it belongs to my mother and her husband, but it was on the property that I live on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| and it was less than 50 feet from the very end of Billy Neal Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2445)|
| 0:40:55| So there's the trailer out there on the end of Billy Neal, my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| and a bunch of woods to the right, a bunch of birds and animals, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| So nobody could see the cars behind the eight-foot fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| It was on a high elevation, the highest elevation around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| and like I say, it was 100 percent within the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| but I think they just wanted to yank my chain because I've got some other complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2478)|
| 0:41:26| with the county and with Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| They stole 43 of my vehicles in Jefferson County in 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| and that was, y'all got to hear that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| I'm hoping to put it on a book on tape and give it away, just like these rocks over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| But it's real interesting, and I appreciate y'all's time, and I'll see you if I'm living next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Sir, can I just ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| In your opening comment, you referenced a Knox County employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| That employee has not been with Knox County for over seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| I'm still a victim of criminal activity within Knox County, within the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| I just want people in the audience to understand this is something that didn't happen last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| He's not been an employee of this county for over seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| I mentioned the groundbreaking of Carter Elementary School twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| Continuing with public forum, is there a Mr. Pat, P-A-T-T?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2559)|
| 0:42:49| Sir, the subject that you wish to speak about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2569)|
| 0:42:59| On rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| Do you wish to speak now or later when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| Whatever suits you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| No, you may speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Now is a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Timothy Pat, West Raccoon Valley Road, 1931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| This is my wife, Walter Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| And please try to stay with the five minutes for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| I've got a rental property, and I've got a disabled veteran that lives in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| and they give him one of these life alert buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| I don't know if it malfunctions or if he hits it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| He's bedridden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| He's a disabled veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| And every day or two, or every week or two, rural metro comes flying up the road in a fire truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2625)|
| 0:43:54| and they send me the bill for $1,450 every time they come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| and I've got four different bills here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| I mean, I hate to evict a disabled veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| I mean, he's going to be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| He has no family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| But what do I need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| I mean, I'm at your mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| I mean, I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| I mean, he's bedridden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| He's served our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| He's up in his age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| He's had two strokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| But I cannot continue to pay him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| I cannot pay these bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| I'm a farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I raise beef, cattle, and mow hay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| That's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| And I've got this old farmhouse I rent to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| He's been there nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| And he can't afford to pay it, but he's probably got good insurance that could pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| But they don't bother to bill him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| They just bill me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| They say they cannot bill the tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| They have to bill the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| So to me, I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| The last time I heard the truck coming, of course, now my heart jumps three or four beats every time I hear a firetruck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| Because, I mean, it's getting up in the money now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I take my little side-by-side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| I was feeding cattle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| And I meet them at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Well, the fire engine pulls up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| A man jumps out, and he goes to the door, and he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| Is everything okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| And Mr. Crockett says, Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| They shut the door, leaving the firetruck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| A few days later, I receive another bill, $1,450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| It says lift assist on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Well, I know that's a crock, because I was sitting right there watching it with my own eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| And they didn't even go in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| But yet I've got the bill right here, $1,450, lift assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| The man's laying right there, and he's bedridden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| So he can't, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| But I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| I mean, I'm at your mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| We're a little concerned about, I'm concerned about everybody in the community that's getting these bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| We've been talking to several people, and a lot of people are getting these type of bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| It's going to affect our, if we have to pay this to keep our land that we've worked and paid for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| this is going to affect our life tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| It's going to affect Mr. Crockett's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| He's not going to get to live there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| We're going to have to evict him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| But all these other people in the county that's having to pay this, that's getting billed for this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| I worry about them, because rural metro, I don't think that they need to be billing people for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| It's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| And they're just putting the money, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| What are they doing with the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| And the poor people in the county that's paying the money are going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| eventually they're going to be homeless because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Well, I don't understand the $1,450 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Do you know anybody that makes that besides NASA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| I mean, I don't make that a week, let alone an hour, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| Don't make it hardly a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| But, I mean, that's just, that's devastating to anybody who could afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| It just, it don't make no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you, Mr. Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Could you wait there just a second, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Mr. Pat, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| You have your bills there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| Does anywhere on that bill state first responder or ambulance service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| What does it say in there in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| It just says tender 232, one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| And what's the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Tender 232, same truck, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| One hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| And you've got a third one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| We've actually got, we've actually had four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| We've actually had four, but I don't know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| One of them in March, 14th, and three of them in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| They all say the same, and they all say lift assist, which I know one of them was alive because I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| They didn't even go in the house, but, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| So none of them says like first responder or ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| It is a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| It's a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Tender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| It says tender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Thank you, Mr. Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| If you happen to be around when we discuss this later on, we may need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| We hope that you can do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| Continuing with public forum, Randy Pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2890)|
| 0:48:20| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Randy Pace, 554 Valley Hill Lane, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2903)|
| 0:48:32| I want to thank Commission for the opportunity to address you this afternoon regarding issues of the Canton Hollow Road proposed improvement project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2912)|
| 0:48:46| As some of you may already know, I have a background in community development, not only as a mayor and councilman, but also as a planning board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2926)|
| 0:48:57| I come to you as an advocate for the public trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| I've spoken with some of you one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| I've spoken with members of the MPC staff, Knox County Engineering Department, and residents throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| My initial reaction to a report indicating that Canton Hollow Road was the most dangerous road in Knox County was skeptical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2952)|
| 0:49:21| However, I recognize that public safety is paramount, and I wanted to be supportive and assist my neighbors in understanding the process in a positive light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2961)|
| 0:49:34| As I began to review the proposed project, it quickly became clear that I could not support what was being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2974)|
| 0:49:43| I want to thank the director of Knox County Engineering and Public Works for the information he provided in helping me gain a better understanding about the road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2983)|
| 0:49:53| I've taken the time to compile a list of concerns that I and many other residents have concerning the proposed road improvements on Canton Hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=2993)|
| 0:50:03| A recent MPC decision regarding the Southwest Sector Plan amendment and rezoning further our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3003)|
| 0:50:11| That issue is before county commission later this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| Real quick background, you'll note that in your agenda packet under that application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| the MPC conducted a public hearing on the 13th of July for the Sector Plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| five days before the scheduled public meeting for the proposed Canton Hollow Road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| I requested the application be delayed until the 18th of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| That request was ignored despite support from a number of MPC board members and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| The following are concerns. Their order do not represent any particular order of importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| We believe they all deserve your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| The disregard for the public's right to be informed regarding the road improvement project prior to making decisions that have a direct impact on public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3054)|
| 0:51:05| Granted, that one doesn't apply to commission, but it certainly applies or falls within your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| The disregard of federal, state, and local development standards and established engineering and community planning standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| to achieve unrealistic goals regarding community development as it relates to walkable communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| The clarity of information provided the public regarding the need and cost for installation of sidewalks and bike paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3085)|
| 0:51:32| in accordance with development standards and lack of any supporting evidence that installation of sidewalks and bike lanes or bike paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3092)|
| 0:51:42| are appropriate based on the location and the number of residents served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| as well as right-of-way hillside and ridgetop protection areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| The consideration of alternative locations to these types of improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| And I'll go into that further on the other item on the agenda later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| The lack of consideration from MPC that existing, ongoing, and future development places on the public's safety and financial interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3124)|
| 0:52:13| And that was in their own words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| The lack of consistency and accuracy of the information being provided the public concerning costs associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3136)|
| 0:52:26| future and future responsibility of maintenance and upkeep of the sidewalks in this road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3146)|
| 0:52:36| The impact to local neighborhoods and properties during road construction and improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| Our recommendations are as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Direct the engineering department to conduct and publish a review of the design standards as they relate directly to Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3164)|
| 0:52:54| Direct the engineering department to conduct and publish a review of the research already conducted by the MPC Bicycle Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3174)|
| 0:53:02| and the crash data report published by MPC's Transportation Planning Office on June 15, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3182)|
| 0:53:11| As it relates to the appropriateness of bike lanes and sidewalks on Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| Direct the engineering department to review the repositioning of Trent and Jennings in Canton Hollow Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| as it relates to site distances, the change in site distances, and the cost to reposition utilities in the interest of public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3204)|
| 0:53:34| Direct the engineering department to publish proposed traffic pattern changes during each phase of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| Direct the engineering department to publish a detailed cost breakdown for the entire project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| to include estimates for right-of-way acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| Direct the MPC, I'm sorry, recommend to the MPC to consider public input in its decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3231)|
| 0:54:00| Direct the, excuse me, we'll move that to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| Consider scaling back the installation of sidewalks and bike lanes on Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| Consider relocating improvements to Campbell Station, Fox Road to connect to North Shore, Concord, and the other communities served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3251)|
| 0:54:24| Maintain consistency with regional bikeway plans and consider partnering with the City of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| and the City of Knoxville in developing a better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Consider widening the travel lane on Canton Hollow Road in the interest of public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| to a minimum of 26 feet which is essentially 6 feet less than the design standard of 32 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3282)|
| 0:54:53| The concerns over the approval and construction of developments within the southwest sector is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| An annual report indicates dangerous roads are being created by a lack of proper planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3299)|
| 0:55:07| The MPC's lack of consideration for infrastructure costs and completion of infrastructure projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| are creating a dangerous situation, not to mention an increased burden on schools and county administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3315)|
| 0:55:24| I look forward to your responses and I'll remain available to you and the public going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| I am here to volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you, Mr. Pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| And then the last order of our public forum today is Buddy Hines still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3339)|
| 0:55:52| Buddy Hines, stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| This is me, Dave Wright, speaking to my cousin, Buddy Hines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| Now, some people might take me to be literal in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| but I have trouble really finding the actual bloodline that would make him a relative of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3369)|
| 0:56:19| but I still call him a cousin because I consider him to be a cousin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| I did not know him as he grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| We grew up in separate parts of town, but Buddy is being appointed to the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3385)|
| 0:56:33| so I just want people to know that whenever I call him a cousin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| that didn't mean he got a job on the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| In fact, Todd Napier, would you please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Todd is the director of the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| and we're having a little rolling around with the membership of the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3408)|
| 0:56:58| I would like to say that I have been there for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| and I view the work being undertaken and developed by the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3422)|
| 0:57:11| as an arm of Knox County is leading to quality jobs coming into Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3431)|
| 0:57:19| and I want to recognize that by having these two gentlemen stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Commissioner Schoonmaker, were you wanting to recognize someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| No, I just didn't know if you wanted them on camera or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| I think they're standing over in the shadow saying that they are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| Also, there is a reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| These are two agenda items today that are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| There is also an agenda item for the reappointment of Mike Edwards to the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| Neither of these items have been pulled from consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| and I just wanted to make sure that people recognized, first, Buddy Hines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| taking the step forward to serve the community as a member of the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| and then Todd Napier for being the strong direction that Development Corporation is receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| in support of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Are there any other comments from my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| Thank you both for being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| I have worked a handwritten list of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| Is there anyone else that considers themselves to be signed up to speak on public forum this afternoon, this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3505)|
| 0:58:34| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| Please step forward, sir, if you're wishing to speak public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| You do not wish to speak to a certain item of the agenda, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| Well, it's on the agenda, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| If I need to wait my turn, I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| You can speak now or you can speak when your item comes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| I'll be happy to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| My name is Gary Hibben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| I'm the owner of Highway Markings Incorporated, a local company here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| We've been doing business with Knox County for several years now, probably 15 or 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| I've been in the business 50 years, but what brings me to this collection of commission members tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3555)|
| 0:59:28| is a contract that I've had for a few years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| I've had some for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| but one that extended into January of next year on some highway guardrail services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| Then I got a letter and an email on the same day, June the 9th, from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| stating that they were going to re-bid this work due to the convenience of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| Well, I'm not sure if I understand the word convenience, but sure not convenient for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| I was planning on this contract running out until at least January next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| and even at that point having another year to renew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| But the problem is that some of you all are certainly aware of the last three or four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| of these guardrail issues on these impact heads getting hit and several people losing their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| Well, TDOT reacted, and I do a lot of TDOT work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| I'm guardrail and pavement markings, concrete work, and signs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| But some unfortunate accidents happened because of some of these terminal anchors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| which as far as I know, and I've been doing Knox County's work for several years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| that Knox County has not had any of these installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| but still as a safety precaution the state wanted to change some of these on jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| So therefore, Knox County thought it would be pertinent to go ahead and re-bid this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3644)|
| 1:00:52| And in the past, if they had an item that they wanted to add, they would send you an addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| But this is re-bidding the whole contract, and the mainstay of this is it's bid for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3657)|
| 1:01:05| But then they have four-year renewals, which makes it a five-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| And ladies and gentlemen, that's not really fair for a company, not mine, anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| to be knocked out of bidding something for five years. That's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| And I just respectfully ask, in consideration, not only does this issue of guardrail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3681)|
| 1:01:30| there are other items I know that Knox County bids for five years, and maybe those people are happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| Even when I had a five-year contract, I told purchasing many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| that it should be a one-year, with a one-year extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| and then whoever gets it has the option of adding additional pricing to the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| and nobody on the outside would know that except the contractor that has it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| so you don't know what the prices end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| When they re-bid this, I got a letter June the 9th, they re-bid it July the 19th, if that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| I'm talking just not without any notes, but we were not the successful bidder on pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3724)|
| 1:02:12| On the other 30% of the contractors, we scored high, as high as you could possibly get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| and I was bidding trying to get an answer from purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| and the highway department or public works, why are you re-bidding it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| Why didn't you send some addendums out? That's the way it had been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| Well, Knox County purchasing, just one particular person said, well, this is the way we've always done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3751)|
| 1:02:38| Well, I know we're living in 2017 and things have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| but just because you've always done it that way doesn't make it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| and what I'm asking tonight from the commission is I don't want any special favors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| I'm just trying to get some wrongs changed that some of these service contracts at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| not only in public works, but other areas of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| need to be for a one-year period with a one-year renewal makes it a two-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| I've been in this 51 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| I service a lot of counties in Region 1, which is East Tennessee, Region 2, Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| and there's not but three counties that I know of that even do it for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| and that's Sevier, Williamson, and Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| In four years with these extensions, the contractor that has it could increase his prices for whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3806)|
| 1:03:34| and I'm not sore about losing a bid because I bid it fair and square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| but the question is my price has been higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| If this contractor within two or three years raises his numbers to where they equal mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| you're right back to where we were at square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| I've asked three options that we either pass on another 30 days to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3832)|
| 1:04:04| or we let the contract that's in place now continue until January, which is just four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| I haven't had any work since the middle of May from Knox County, and I appreciate Knox County's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| It's the extension of a contract that needs the attention of this body of members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3857)|
| 1:04:26| to not let a contract extend into a five-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| For any of you in business, you shut the door on somebody for five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| and you don't know what the other people are getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| I know it's public record, but you're always having to check to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| I don't have that much time in my life anymore to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| but I just ask that we either postpone it, use the contract in place now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| or re-bid it when it comes up for renewal in January of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| That's all I have to say, and thank you so very much, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| Thank you, Mr. Hibben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| The item that he is speaking to is Resolution 406, page 9, is not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3902)|
| 1:05:10| We will discuss this item at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Is there anyone else who thought they were on public forum this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3915)|
| 1:05:23| If not, we're moving on to—I'm going to use my list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3923)|
| 1:05:31| Honorary Resolutions, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| Yes, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| I would ask that we defer Resolution 101 for 30 days until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| That's a form of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| What is before us is to move this honorary to the next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3953)|

| 1:05:59| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=3959)|

| 1:06:51| I thought it was real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4011)|

| 1:07:03| I believe he had given commissioners an invitation to the TVA and I Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| Does anyone wish to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4029)|

| 1:07:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| We're now to that point to place amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| Are there items to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4085)|

| 1:09:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| I have one that has to deal with, we discussed it earlier in the workshop, but there was something else that came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| and I wanted to ask the school about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| It's number 201, and I just want to get some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| I don't know if it's fact or not, but I was wondering if they could answer just one more question on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| This item is on consent, but I will allow you the opportunity to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| It will be approved, though, at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| So if the Board of Education, if the superintendent or his person might be prepared to speak on 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4208)|
| 1:10:19| 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| It will just be to ask and answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| Are there other items to be pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Dr. Ryswick is coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| I don't know if you want to do it now or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| Dr. Ryswick, I would let you, please stand to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| Now stand to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| This is a question of Commissioner Busler on item 201, page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Doctor, you answered my question I asked, but then there was another, something came up on information on the ACT test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4254)|
| 1:11:05| Is there a law that's coming into effect in 18 or 19 that the high schools will be judged on the average ATC scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4265)|
| 1:11:16| that will affect the management of those high schools if they don't meet that 22 level on the ACT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4276)|
| 1:11:26| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| There actually is a law for this year's graduating class that all students have to take either the ACT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| or the SAT as a requirement for graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| There's not a passing grade set on that for every student, but just that they have to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| There's also, but the state has set a goal by 2020 to have a composite average for the state of a 21 or higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4300)|
| 1:11:50| Currently in Knox County, we're at a 21.1, so we already meet that for where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| But there will be, ACT will be figured in as part of the accountability structure moving forward for all schools in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4315)|
| 1:12:03| So you say it's a 21 point, what I heard from some other counties was it was going to be a 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4323)|
| 1:12:11| and I just wanted to make sure that that was, it is a 21 though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| 21 point something, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| The composite score of a 21 on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| There's some subtests to that that make up that score, but the composite score of a 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| So by the year 2020, the state has a goal that the average composite for the state will be a 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| A total 21, that is the composite score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| And if they don't meet that, what is the penalty to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| We're under a new law now, ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act, which is different than No Child Left Behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4361)|
| 1:12:48| So this is the first year of accountability that we've had under that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| and the state is still clarifying some of those types of things that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| Right now, what we're looking at are kind of how the system or how the district would be classified as a needs of improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4376)|
| 1:13:07| or exemplary or those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| But as far as we haven't heard anything about monetary restrictions or anything like that that would come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| it's more, you know, we know this coming year schools will receive a letter grade rank by Tennessee law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| so every school in Knox County will get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| Districts will also receive some of those, again, different classifications based on how their scores are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| But to this point, you know, we haven't heard any monetary restrictions that would be placed on the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| Well, I want to talk about monetary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| There was one county that I was in talking to some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| and they said that if that particular high school did not reach that level that they could be, I guess, run by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4421)|
| 1:13:53| That's a good question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Well, I mean, they may have some different information, but as far as it's a little more complex than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| So the state has different classifications of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| and so one of those would be a priority status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| A priority status would be a school that falls in the bottom 5% based on achievement measures across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4448)|
| 1:14:15| and then they have to remain in there for an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| They typically give districts some time to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| And then there is an achievement school district that can actually come into priority schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| and then the state can claim those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| But to my knowledge, there's not one based solely on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Thank you, Dr. Ryslick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| We are now finalizing the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| There are four items that will be discussed this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| Is there any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| Do I hear a motion that the agenda is set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4488)|

| 1:15:04| Madam Clerk, I think we're to drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| Are there drives and roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| There are no drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| Do I hear a motion to approve line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Motion is properly before us to approve line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4519)|

| 1:15:44| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| Motion is properly before us to approve 232 notaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4556)|

| 1:16:00| Those applications are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4560)|
| 1:16:09| We're back in order, I think, looking at the four items of tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| Madam Clerk, we will read consent at a later hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4573)|
| 1:16:26| If there be no objection, we will read consent at a later hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| Madam Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| First item is on page nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| It's resolution 406, approving a contract with Tennessee Guardrail Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| to provide guardrail installation and maintenance services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| Did I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| Motion to approve so we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Dwight, I guess, really just kind of some of the questions that were proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| Do we have a contract that ran through January and we've slowed that down or canceled that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| How do we get to where we're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Dwight Mendevate, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| We'll be joined tonight by Jim Snowden and Karen Smitherman from procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| and Chris Sivier, who is our capital projects manager who does guardrail inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| but I'll let them introduce themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| We have a contract currently that is the same as the contract that is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| It's five years with one-year increments and an opportunity to renew every 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| We did terminate early, but we terminated two months early due to the fact that TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| had changed so many elements in the approved products list that we felt it was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| These are always very difficult situations when you've got good local companies bidding on the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| and we appreciate the history that we've enjoyed with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| but in this case, the process that was observed by procurement is, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| it is a by-the-numbers, objective, and fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| I don't know that it could have been done any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| I'd be remiss if I didn't publicly recognize Karen Smitherman and Matt Myers for the work they've done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| We'll be glad to answer any questions, but this is by the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| We are requesting an affirmative vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| We'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| And, again, I've got the staff here that is involved in this every day, day in and day out in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| and they'll be glad to answer any questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| I guess what I just heard is that one of the previous commenters' suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| were that not to have a five-year contract, but that's what we kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| one-year renewals is what we just come off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| It's exactly the same, and the contract that's before you is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| It's for five years, but once a year we have the opportunity to revisit the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| if for any reason we want to terminate, if we're not satisfied with the performance of the vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| if we have any form of issue of delivery of goods or services, we do have the right, as noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| at the county's convenience to terminate the contract, and we can and will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| I think there's three other contracts, not ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| but I think there's three other contracts that are exactly the same on commission's agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| This one is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| I should also mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| Well, another thing I noticed in the contract, it says we can use other vendors if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| Did I read that correctly in the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Occasionally there will be a product or treatment that the vendor under contract is unable to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| or will have a need for exigency, and so we do leave ourselves as many options as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| Obviously our job is to get the best price and product for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| and give ourselves as much flexibility as we can, so that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| I should mention also, since the contract's before you, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| I don't actually know the gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| but I think a representative from the company that we recommend is here, Mr. Derek Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4798)|
| 1:20:07| Okay, so Mr. Howard is here if you have questions regarding their particular company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| He's in the audience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| They have also been a vendor under contract, and just like Mr. Hibben's company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| a good professional partner to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| You know these things are always tough, because when you take it to market and you bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| our job is to get the best possible price for the county and the best possible service for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| and that's bluntly what we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| So we wish we could leave everybody satisfied at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| but that's very difficult under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| Thank you, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| Dwight, we had the discussion this afternoon and explained that within one year, 30 days before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4845)|
| 1:20:53| is this bid not a letter sent to the current contract holder asking for a price increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| if there will be any price increases, and if so, you do have the right to go out again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| and ask for other bids at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| And the contract that's before you also limits price increases to the consumer price index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| So it's already capped, but if we're dissatisfied, we still have the option to consider terminating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| But it is already capped within the terms of the contract that's before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| Dwight, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| Is there a reason we didn't let this run out in January instead of doing this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| Yes, sir, and I'd probably do well, Commissioner Thomas, to let Jim give you the specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| or actually Chris Sivier, who most of you will not have dealt with Chris very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| He's one of those people that's in the field working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| But Chris is our resident expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| He does the inspections and field review on guardrail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| He really has done a fine job for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| Guardrail is an evolving science, as most things in transportation are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| TDOT has an approved materials list that changes and changes and changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| and we try to stay as current with that as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Those changes have just gotten to the point where they were so numerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| we felt like it was time to go ahead and re-bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| and make sure that we had everything that's on TDOT's approved product list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| covered by the terms of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| But they have price increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| We're protected there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| We have a CPI provision in this contract, so we are protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| I personally would like to make a comment in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| in response to this five-year, moving contracts to five-year increments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4958)|
| 1:22:48| because other contracts are written that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| would not necessarily mean that it's a good reason to approve this contract being five years in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4973)|
| 1:23:02| This may come out later on in other discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| but for that one reason, for that one reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| I will be a no vote on this contract this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| I just say that for the purpose of my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| And to make sure, Mr. Chairman, I've done a good job of clarifying the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| In effect, this is a five-year contract in one-year increments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| so we do have the right every year to end this relationship and go back to market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| if we so desire to find a vendor that is meeting our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| In the ear of the chair, we will go to a roll call vote, beginning with Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5034)|
| 1:24:04| And let me say this evening, I did not announce this earlier, this is the 12th month of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5044)|
| 1:24:12| so Commissioner Gill will be called on first to vote on all roll call votes this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5052)|
| 1:24:20| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| Commissioner Gill votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| I don't think we addressed it if we don't pass, but we go back to having nothing and re-bidding the whole thing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5066)|
| 1:24:38| A pass is a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| No, if it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| If it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| Let's pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| I need you to address your question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| If you don't pass the resolution to confirm this contract, then it will be shifted back and they will have to re-bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5092)|
| 1:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| I just wanted to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5101)|

| 1:26:04| Madam Clerk, I believe we're at 4.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5164)|
| 1:26:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| It is a resolution approving ten agreements with the Tennessee Department of Transportation, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5175)|

| 1:30:10| Madam Clerk, backing up to the item 604, page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5410)|
| 1:30:18| This is a resolution approving an extension of ambulance service agreement with rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| metro of Tennessee LP to provide medical ambulance services in Knox County for an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| five-year term, July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2023, as allowed in the current contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5427)|

| 1:30:37| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| Motion is properly before us with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5452)|
| 1:30:59| Or do you want to wait for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| We can have discussion after substitute motion or we can have discussion before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| Your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| I'm going to wait for the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5470)|
| 1:31:23| Okay, who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Oh, Commissioner Andrews, did you have anything you wish to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| No, I just wanted to get the discussion rolling, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| Back to Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| We've discussed this for a little while and I have one issue that I want to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5504)|
| 1:31:53| That has to do with the billing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| As you can understand with Mr. Pat out here, that he's received a bill for $1,450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5518)|
| 1:32:06| In our contract here, in this total contract, it refers to rural metro, let's see if I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5526)|
| 1:32:16| got the name right, it's rural metro of Tennessee LP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5536)|
| 1:32:24| And from my understanding, that is the rural metro ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| And in that it refers to the contractor, which is the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5551)|
| 1:32:39| And in the contract, it has a pricing structure, which it says all inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5559)|
| 1:32:48| If you've all read it, it's all inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| Since AMR rural metro ambulance utilizes first responder service for outsource vendor, that's rural metro fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5573)|
| 1:33:06| does the fee structure in 6.6 apply to the outsource vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5586)|
| 1:33:16| I'm not sure that we even, we're talking about the contractor using a subcontractor to meet their servicing schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5596)|
| 1:33:30| Does, and I even got from Dr. Buchanan, I asked her if rural metro ambulance service, and correct me if I'm wrong, okay, please do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5610)|
| 1:33:42| That rural metro ambulance service, I don't know what the name is, I'm not sure what's going to be on the contract or what's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5622)|
| 1:33:52| They use rural metro fire, which is a separate entity, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| They're two separate entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| There are two separate entities, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| They are, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| They also use Carnes and Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5649)|
| 1:34:16| And I read that information to you about to utilize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| There are two sources and they utilize both Carnes and the city fire for that first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5660)|
| 1:34:30| My question is, if you use the fire service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5670)|
| 1:34:38| My question is, if you use the fire service as a first responder, as part of the fire agreement that we have with the contractor only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5678)|
| 1:34:51| which is the ambulance, not the fire department with the ambulance, but they use that fire to fulfill their agreement with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5691)|
| 1:35:02| is the citizens of Knox County only due to, as it says in here, what the ambulance cost is, which is $755.25 plus mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5702)|
| 1:35:25| If they charge $14.50, that sounds to me is overbilling, but is that service for first responder, which it says in the contract here, is all-inclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5725)|
| 1:35:39| and in the contract it also says that's part of their service as a first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5739)|
| 1:35:47| So if they go out with a non-subscriber, to me this contract says they can only charge $755.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5747)|
| 1:35:59| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| I think they can charge $755.25 plus, it's $8 and something, I recall off the top of my head, mileage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5765)|
| 1:36:14| And it says in there that that's all-inclusive, so meaning there's no additional charges under the contract if it's an ambulance call to meet this criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5774)|
| 1:36:24| And they can fulfill that themselves through another party, but it's still charged what the contract says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5784)|
| 1:36:35| Okay, so the third party is not the responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5795)|
| 1:36:44| Well, never mind, I'll get my thoughts together here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| But the only thing I can read in this contract is there's only one fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| If somebody calls 911 and says I need an ambulance service, they send a first responder to that job, then $755.25 is all-inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5812)|
| 1:37:05| And to me that's the only charge you could charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| May I clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| And with all due respect, our contract is for ambulance services only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| And Mr. Law Director or Charlie Sturkey, correct me if I'm wrong, the contract doesn't address billing for first responders at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5841)|
| 1:37:30| We don't have a contract with first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| We only have a contract for ambulance services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| The contract with ambulance services does allow for first responders to be part of the response system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5856)|
| 1:37:43| but there's no contract silent on what they bill or don't bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| Could I ask, excuse me, let's go back to your original question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5868)|
| 1:38:00| I think it was framed in the context of how does the ambulance service get graded on responding to a dispatch of an ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5880)|
| 1:38:13| and you named rural metro as being a first responder, but Carnes Volunteer, the Knoxville Rescue Squad, Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5893)|
| 1:38:29| And Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| All of these are non-contracted people, but they respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| They are helping the ambulance, I'll say people, meet or not meet their response times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5918)|
| 1:38:50| Is that your original, is that your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| That's what I'm trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| See, in the original contract here on page three, it lists words and terms defined under this contract, and it talks about first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5935)|
| 1:39:07| And if they utilize that first responder, we have a contract only with rural metro ambulance to take care of emergency calls that require transports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5947)|
| 1:39:23| So when they call 911 and say I need an ambulance, what's the first thing that is sent out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5963)|
| 1:39:32| It should be an ambulance, but if they send a fire truck, then on the bill, if they're using them as a first responder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5972)|
| 1:39:39| and Mr. Pat came up here and said there's nothing on that bill that says first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5979)|
| 1:39:46| It says fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| Now, let me go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| In section 409, and it states in here, shall cooperate and coordinate its activity services with first responders for the purpose of ensuring quality patient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=5992)|
| 1:40:07| The contractor, which is the ambulance service, will maintain records of this stated requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6007)|
| 1:40:17| Okay, in 708, it says the contractor may use the ALS first responder for meeting the response time required set forth in this section 406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6017)|
| 1:40:29| Indicates time requirements, damages, and penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| But they're using that as their ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| And we have a thing, and if you've got a copy of this, it states in here the rate charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6037)|
| 1:40:48| And it says everything is inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| In the contract, it states and defines first responder, the ALS term, all these conditions are in here in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6052)|
| 1:41:05| My question is how much, if this is the only person that we've got with pricing on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6065)|
| 1:41:16| and they utilize a third party to fulfill their agreement with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| who's responsible for paying that third party if they're going to charge $1450?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| The contract says all we have to pay is $755.25 plus mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| Now that's the problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| There's not definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| And plus I was asking what the term is for the services that we're getting or who is in charge of this ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6097)|
| 1:41:48| If you've looked at any of the statements that have come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| I hate to bring this up, but there are, let me tell you what's on one bill that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6114)|
| 1:42:04| Okay, it says American Medical Response, Medical West Ambulance, Las Vegas, Abbott EMS, AMR, Medics, Medstat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6124)|
| 1:42:13| and Rural Metro of Tennessee LP plus, I have a new one, I don't even know who it's from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6133)|
| 1:42:21| that if you want that ambulance service, from then it comes out as Emergency Care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| And a lot of this is redacted on the front of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| and the only thing that relates this Emergency Care to Rural Metro division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| is that it's a marketing corporation to go for to get that ambulance service if you want to subscribe to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6156)|
| 1:42:44| That's another issue I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| What's the name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Who are we dealing with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| Who, since we have a separate ambulance service and a separate fire service, who regulates the fire cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6168)|
| 1:42:56| We regulate the ambulance cost, and we're dealing with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| and they're sending fire service out to the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| Does this contract that we have, the way I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| says $755.25 plus mileage is the only thing we should be charged for an ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6186)|
| 1:43:14| No more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| That's who we have the contract, is the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| I have no problem with their service or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| I have a problem with that other charge of $14.50 that's automatically used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| Now, in my opinion, if I'm contracting with whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6207)|
| 1:43:36| and I can't fulfill that contract and I use somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| there's no way I can charge for that other service I have to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| I have to absorb the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| So does the bill go back to $14.50 to the ambulance side since they're separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| Because it shouldn't go as a third party to my constituents out there since they only ask for one service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6232)|
| 1:44:00| Now, do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| I may just completely clear as mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| Do you understand what the problem I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| I don't have a problem with their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| In fact, I get great comments about the people that come out and do the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| The problem I have is the billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| And who do we bill to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| Who's sending the bills out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Who do we contact if we have a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| So that's why I think this needs to be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| and the only way I know to correct this is put the right wording in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6271)|
| 1:44:39| I believe Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| You know, a lot of times the commission, everything goes very smoothly, goes very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6283)|
| 1:44:50| But it's moments like this that define all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| and I love the fact that we all get together and discuss things as important as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6292)|
| 1:45:00| You know, I really am not concerned about who gets our ambulance contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| In fact, I'm only concerned about who can do the best job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| And when we discussed this last Monday, I heard from a lot of people that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6309)|
| 1:45:15| I didn't even know this was something that was coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| And most of the people I heard from were seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| I guess because they think they're going to be most likely the soonest people to use this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6324)|
| 1:45:33| Rightfully so, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| There's a lot of pressure on this because there's so many interested parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| but I think we've got to get it right and we've got to make sure that we discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| we find out what are the best answers, and what's the best decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| I have a question that a senior asked me, and I guess, Dr. Buchanan, if you could answer it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6351)|
| 1:46:00| I know that a lot of the response times, if not all, are self-reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6360)|
| 1:46:08| My mom is 88, so seven years ago she had a heart attack and she needed an ambulance right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6368)|
| 1:46:19| If a fire truck gets there, does their time stop right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6379)|
| 1:46:25| They've responded, even though an ambulance may not be there for ten more minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| But the fire trucks they dispense, that's the wrong word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| The fire trucks they dispatch are specifically ALS first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| It's not just any fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| Larry can clarify that better than I can because he knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| But the staffing is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| They have the capabilities to take care of that emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| Well, if she needed transport, that's the only thing she's concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| She needed to get there as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| I remember that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Larry Hutzel, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| My title is emergency response coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| In a situation, if it comes in as a priority one or priority two call, an ALS first responder engine could be sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6424)|
| 1:47:14| If that ALS first responder engine is sent and they get there within ten minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| then they get an additional seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| So they have 17 minutes to get to the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| Now, depending on the emergency, not all fire trucks or ALS fire engines may be dispatched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6445)|
| 1:47:30| So they could very well see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| If your mom called and she was having a heart attack, you could very well see a fire truck show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| an ALS fire truck in behind it, and an ambulance comes in behind that to transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| So the time would stop, though, when the fire truck gets there, right, for the reporting purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| No, sir, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| No, sir, it does not stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| It gives that ambulance seven more minutes to get to the scene for a total of 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6472)|
| 1:47:59| If it's ALS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| Yes, if it's ALS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| So, no, the clock does not stop when the fire truck gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| It stops when the ambulance gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| Let's pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| We're saying ALS fire truck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| When I say ALS, I'm talking, it's EMT and paramedic advanced life support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6499)|
| 1:48:26| We're saying rural metro, it says, on the fire truck, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| It could say Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| It could say Carnes Volunteer Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| So, as stated earlier, there are lots of people that can help stop the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6515)|
| 1:48:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Reset the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| I think a better word, not stop the clock, is reset the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| Extend the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| Okay, extend the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| That's a good word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| Let me ask, and several people mentioned this to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| They said, explain to me why there were no public meetings on this beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| And I said, well, this was not the way it was set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| I had a senior that said, well, you have traffic calming meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| You have meetings about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Why didn't we know about this so we can come and give comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| The short answer is that we followed the process we follow for contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| When there's an extension requested by the vendor, we did our evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| We made a recommendation to the mayor based on that evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| And then it gets put on county commission as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| So we really followed your process for how an extension of a contract would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6580)|
| 1:49:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| And somebody else asked me this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| And just so that we're clear, Envision owns AMR, and AMR bought Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6593)|
| 1:50:02| And now KKR is buying Envision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| I will let one of my AMR colleagues answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| My name is Chris Blatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| I'm the regional director for Tennessee for AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| And my address is 10140 Gallus Point Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| So is this the way it's set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| Envision owned AMR, AMR bought Rural Metro, and now KKR is buying Envision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| So Envision owned AMR and a company called MCARE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| They elected to focus on their physician practices, so they're retaining their MCARE business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6637)|
| 1:50:44| and they're selling their AMR Rural Metro business to KKR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| KKR will be merging AMR and Rural Metro with the AMGH helicopter program under a new name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6650)|
| 1:50:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| And, you know, I wish that wasn't taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| That kind of concerns me, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| I read a statement KKR made last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| They said to Reuters writer Carl Donnell, said it hopes to strengthen its leadership role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6670)|
| 1:51:17| by rolling up smaller competitors and cutting out costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| And my concern is if they're going to cut costs, I don't know where those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6682)|
| 1:51:28| and I don't even know if they're going to be employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| And I looked at the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| There's no staffing requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| Are there in this contract at a certain level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| I mean, I know it's performance, but, I mean, you don't have X amount of EMTs or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6696)|
| 1:51:45| No, we have to meet the minimum staffing configurations as dictated by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6705)|
| 1:51:52| And then our contract is even more stringent as far as, as you stated, sir, performance-based contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6712)|
| 1:52:00| And we actually have to run paramedic and EMT advanced units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6720)|
| 1:52:07| whereas other counties don't run that high a level of staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| And obviously there's a lot of penalties associated with our performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| so we can't, it would be very difficult to reduce staffing and still meet the performance standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6739)|
| 1:52:27| Amen to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| I guess, you know, KKR, I mean, when I read everything about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| they're a leverage buyout group of bankers, basically, or investors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| and they buy things and they leverage all their assets to buy other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| And I remember this, I've been involved in a few corporate takeovers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| and any time they said, we're not going to have any changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| about a month later what followed was, here are our changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| And so that scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| I wish that that was not taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| When we were purchased by Envision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| they immediately infused over a million dollars into this operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| I anticipate the same to take place when KKR comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| They're merging two very successful organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| and they're going to enjoy the synergy of those operations to lead the way in medical transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6798)|
| 1:53:27| Well, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| They're not a medical company, they're investors, and that scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6810)|
| 1:53:35| They also said they would substitute helicopter rides with cheaper ambulance rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6815)|
| 1:53:46| I don't know if that means it's going to be cheaper for the public or cheaper for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| So that does concern me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| I didn't deserve, I guess, a comment on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| and I hope that doesn't mean a lack of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6834)|
| 1:54:03| I'm just concerned with these corporate takeovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| The big thing that really sticks in my gut is I'm afraid they are going to come back and make changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| and service will suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| And if it does, and if we violate the performance standards of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| or compromise the contract in any way, that the county has remedy to resolve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6858)|
| 1:54:27| Okay, and then, you know, I had not heard this story about this couple before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| so I hope somehow we can remedy their situation with them being billed for somebody they're renting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6873)|
| 1:54:42| So that's another concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| There's just little things in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| I wish we could just say, hey, let's rewrite this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| Evidently, that's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| So these are the things that concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| And to then Commissioner Thomas, let me see if I've got my notes down in response to his questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6897)|
| 1:55:07| The sale, the proposed sale upcoming is not effective yet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| There is a proposed sale on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| It's pending SEC approval, which we expect to be in about October time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| And the corporations that are looking at consolidation are looking at ground transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6924)|
| 1:55:33| maybe leaving fire protection on the side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| They're not consolidating toward health transportation then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| And then I want to back us back up into discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| Last week, Dr. Buchanan's, the evaluation being, this is back early in your question there, Commissioner Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6950)|
| 1:56:05| passing the evaluation, but we had 15 minutes and we don't have that time tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| to discuss whether the evaluation of 1s and 0s or 0s and 2s and those items of how we arrived at passing or failing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6970)|
| 1:56:26| we may have had concern about that last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| And then one last comment of the service we're expecting here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| I believe the comment was that it's better staff, better quality people working in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=6997)|
| 1:56:47| And I do not disagree with that, but what I don't want us to do is to measure ourselves against other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7007)|
| 1:56:56| I will speak to this later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| I've made a distinct and purposeful discussion with at least three groups a day since last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7018)|
| 1:57:10| And one of them happened to be out of county and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| if she has trouble, I'll throw her in the car and we'll head off to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| I do not want that in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| That's not what we have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| But what we have before us is a contract talking about service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| So I'm sorry that I've digressed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| I just wanted to reemphasize to me what I thought the responses were to Commissioner Thomas' questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| And I'm now to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| Chris, since AMR was, I guess, go back a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| the people that were talking about and vouching for rural metro four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| were the ones that are advocating for a rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| And I find it kind of odd that we go back in time and rural metro and AMR were the top two vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7073)|
| 1:58:00| The other vendor that bid wanted us to pay them excess of a million dollars a year to have ambulance service here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7080)|
| 1:58:09| And so AMR and rural metro are your top two vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| They have now merged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| Do you have more employees now than you did before the merger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| We've hired over 100 EMTs and paramedics in the last year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| So when another corporation came in, there was an influx of people, not a reduction of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| So, you know, and you and I and Jerry have had candid conversations that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| while rural metro AMR doesn't walk on water, we are on much better community service than we were two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7118)|
| 1:58:45| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| Have you had any, Dr. Buchanan, have you had any billing complaints come in to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7128)|
| 1:58:54| or I guess Mr. Huddleston, to the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| We, I think a couple of years ago we did have a billing complaint that we, it was a fire question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7138)|
| 1:59:05| so we passed it on to Chief Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| That was a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| If not, other than that, I don't recall any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| I'm looking at Larry because he gets most of those emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| No, we haven't had those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| And I would say that if I do, I mean, since we don't regulate the rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| we set the rate, then I would forward it to rural metro and then ask them to check into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| and then to get back with me about what the final disposition was of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7170)|
| 1:59:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| Chief Harnish, if you could come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| I know we're talking about two different, and again, you know, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| in the last three budgets we've spent less than a half a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| maybe a little over a half a million dollars on emergency services outside of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7202)|
| 2:00:08| We have over 500,000 people in our county, I believe, or close to, no, close to 500,000 in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7208)|
| 2:00:15| And we spend less than a dollar a year per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| And we have a fire department that's a subscription-based, two subscription-based fire departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| that's went to a three-plus insurance rate ISO rating and a five ISO rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7226)|
| 2:00:33| And there are some people that choose to gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| They choose not to subscribe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| You can subscribe, I believe, to the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| I believe that's what emergency care is, is a subscription service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| Is that what emergency care is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| Seventy-five dollars per household covers all out-of-pocket expense for everyone that lives in that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7249)|
| 2:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| And we have over 2,500 subscribers here in Knox alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| Have you all had, I know we get fire questions all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| So in reference to the gentleman that came up early, Mr. Tapp, was it Tapp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| Pat, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| Mr. Pat, why do you bill the homeowner and not the tenant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7271)|
| 2:01:18| Well, to be clear, those calls were billed because they were reported by his tenant as non-emergency requests for lift assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7278)|
| 2:01:27| So not medical calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| Is that what a medical bracelet does, the necklace, is that what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| In his instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| We forgave those bills simply because we didn't want the consequences either to Mr. Pat, his family, or his tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7294)|
| 2:01:43| But the basis for that has to do with the way law in Tennessee allows fire departments to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7303)|
| 2:01:51| And in the absence of a contract with a property owner, and I've been to Sessions Court more times than I want to recount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7311)|
| 2:02:00| the law requires us to use an arcane legal theory called quantum merit, which looks at who gets the value from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7320)|
| 2:02:10| And the value from the property accrues to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| And so, therefore, if we wish to make a claim, we have to make the claim against the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| So it's a little obscure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| I don't entirely understand it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| But that's how the courts have consistently ruled we should collect if the property owner is not a subscriber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7345)|
| 2:02:33| What specific law in DCA or is there a fire commission that allows that to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7353)|
| 2:02:42| You know, I've asked that same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| The answer I get is that quantum merit is a legal theory that's accepted by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| It is not a statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| So, again, I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| That seems to be both what plaintiffs and defendants' attorneys describe, and it's accepted by the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7375)|
| 2:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| Chris, could you come back to the podium for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| What are some things that AMR brought to the table when they bought Rural Metro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| What are we doing this year that we weren't doing three or four years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| So huge financial investment, which allowed us to do a pay adjustment with all of our current staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7397)|
| 2:03:26| We paid tuitions, partnering with Rowan State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| and we held EMT training programs for Knox residents who were interested in careers in EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| We brought about 50 folks through those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| We paid for paramedic scholarships and EMT advanced training programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| We did sign-on bonuses, $15,000 for paramedics and $7,500 for EMT advanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7427)|
| 2:03:55| and that investment in itself was over $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| So it's allowed us to bring a lot of people here from all over the nation, as far as Alaska,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7439)|
| 2:04:05| to Knox County and work at EMS and become residents of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7445)|
| 2:04:12| We've purchased 10 ambulances since the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7452)|
| 2:04:18| We've deployed new state-of-the-art electronic patient care reporting on tablets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7458)|
| 2:04:26| where we can process outcome data, and that will drive our clinical program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7466)|
| 2:04:35| It's been a huge investment locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7475)|
| 2:04:39| Are you doing procedurally anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| I know we spoke about the stroke response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| Is that new or is that prior to the AMR metro merger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7486)|
| 2:04:50| Could I ask my clinical team to come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7492)|
| 2:04:59| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| Chris McLean, 10140 Gallis Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| So I'm the clinical manager for AMR operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| When we talk about stroke and STEMI care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| those are things where we partner with the hospitals to actually be able to get in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| participate, be in good community partners with them to allow them to get accreditations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| What that does is it's really decreased the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| whether it's someone having a cardiac event or a stroke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| to get them below the national standards and to help them achieve accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| Was that in the contract that you all had to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| That's additional stuff, just being a good community partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| And that's not just AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| I'm going to tell you, whether we're the lead, whether we're a partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| or whether we're a follower, that's part of that continuity of care that we're shooting for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| and that's what we're trying to achieve here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| I'm done for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| Can I just add a couple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| I think these are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| When we talk about first responder agencies, we've added equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| We actually donated life pack equipment, monitors out to Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| as well as CARMS to be able to get them to that ALS level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| I'm with Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| If my family's here, I want them to get the best care possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| and that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| My career starts at the top with Dr. Brooksbank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| He's a local ER physician, been here well over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| to John Brinkley with QIQA, or myself with the clinical program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| in addition to Leah, who is a new clinical person here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| Our goal is good patient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| I heard you talk about one of your constituents from your area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7600)|
| 2:06:46| and if it would please the chair and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| I've got Mr. Barker here that can tell you a personal story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| and he wanted to come here to talk to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| to make sure you understand what kind of care he received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| If that's okay, Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| Mr. Barker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7623)|
| 2:07:11| And your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| My name is Jim Barker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| Address is 1937 Hickory Glen Road off Carmichael Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| It's out in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| Excuse me, on April 10th, about 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| I went into major cardiac arrest, more in my grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7647)|
| 2:07:33| The good news was my wife was outside available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| She started giving me CPR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| She has serious arthritis in her arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| So our neighbor, who is a doctor, just happened to be out in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7663)|
| 2:07:50| He came over and helped, and he got the ambulance on the way, AMR ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7670)|
| 2:07:56| The response time they were there, my wife says, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| but she said I was just under 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| A young couple of responders named Sam and Jessica,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| and she said they rolled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| They already knew what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| The hospital had told them what was happening when they called 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| and got me up on the gurney, gave me the defibrillator, put me in the ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7698)|
| 2:08:24| IV, took me down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| I was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| I was heart stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| And in a situation like that, a lot of people don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| After six minutes, your brain starts dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| Ten minutes, you're dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| Twelve minutes, they don't even turn the sirens on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| So it's a quick, intense period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| A lot of people don't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| When I got to the hospital and woke up, I had two stents put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| a piece of plaque had stopped my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| I still have plaque in my veins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| and asked me if I'm pragmatic enough to think that it could happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| And it happened to not, to tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| But I think the thing, the personal side of this, is these people are highly trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7747)|
| 2:09:14| They're very energetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| And one thing that happened that I never expected was two weeks after I was home recuperating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7756)|
| 2:09:26| they called and wanted to know if they could come by the house and see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7766)|
| 2:09:32| I don't know how many other ambulance companies you've got that would do something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| but you certainly have one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| And like Mr. Thomas said earlier about his family, speed is the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7778)|
| 2:09:48| The equipment, the training, the response, I mean, asked me who I would vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7788)|
| 2:09:56| And I'm in the construction, rehabilitation business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| I've got people work for me 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| I could hire people cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| But I believe in continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| I believe in skill sets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| And I think you need to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| And my bill, by the way, was $852.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| I still got it in my folder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| I asked you, you know, what's my life worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| I thought it was a bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| That's all I really have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| No, I thank you for your testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| And I believe you're here in support of the reason that Knox County is wrestling with the ambulance contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7832)|
| 2:10:40| is to make sure that service like you have just described is provided to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7840)|
| 2:10:48| That's the reason we're here is to make sure that service is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| But I guess, like I said, I'm a testimonial to it because in a situation like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7853)|
| 2:10:59| when somebody's heart stops, stroke happens, anything like that, I mean, you're down to minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7859)|
| 2:11:05| Now, if my wife hadn't been there, I wouldn't be here in front of you tonight anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| So luck was a big part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| And I still got an article the people at Park West wrote, put it in the paper, had my picture, said the luckiest man alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7873)|
| 2:11:21| And, you know, I guess I fit that bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7881)|
| 2:11:25| I've nearly never had a lot of luck in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| It's always I've had to work for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| But I guess this was the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| And if I have it again, I hope these people can find me because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7893)|
| 2:11:39| everybody here might need help one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| But I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| We have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7906)|
| 2:11:52| When there's a billing inquiry, what's the process that somebody follows to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7912)|
| 2:11:58| And is it on the bill that they get if there isn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| There's a number that they can call for customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7921)|
| 2:12:05| And we also have a full-time department that's called the AMR Patient Advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7925)|
| 2:12:12| So their full-time job is to help patients navigate through the complex difficulties of hospital billing and medical billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7932)|
| 2:12:23| But once we get a patient in touch with the patient advocate, the problems are resolved very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7943)|
| 2:12:33| Is there anything else you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| We have one other person that came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7957)|
| 2:12:44| So, Chair, thank you for letting us talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| Commissioner Busler, this really relates to what Mr. Barker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| So he kind of gave an explanation that your brain loses its function in four to six minutes of being down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7971)|
| 2:12:58| And that goes back to that first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| So that first responder is the one that gets there the quickest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| They have ALS gear, BLS gear, oxygen, medications, and that is the starting point for the first medical contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7984)|
| 2:13:12| And without that, individuals like Mr. Barker may not be here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| I do have one other gentleman here, Mr. John Bagwell, if I can get him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=7997)|
| 2:13:23| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| No, you have the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| Could I respectfully ask that you withdraw it for the moment so I can open zonings and recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8009)|
| 2:13:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| I withdraw my motion for the only purpose of a recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8018)|
| 2:13:44| Who is the second on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| Commissioner Daly, is it okay that the motion be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| Well, there's two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| Let me ask if I could have a motion for a brief recess to go to zoning for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8038)|
| 2:14:06| I make a motion that we go to a brief recess so we can go to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| For a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| Did I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| All we have before us is a motion to briefly recess the County Commission August meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8056)|
| 2:14:25| for the purpose of dealing with a zoning meeting that's scheduled at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| We are in brief recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8079)|
| 2:14:48| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| I would like to call to order at this time the August meeting of Knox County Board of Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8093)|
| 2:14:59| for the purpose of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| Commissioner Stonemaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8118)|

| 2:15:27| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| I'd like to entertain a motion to briefly, well, maybe not briefly, recess this Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8128)|
| 2:15:35| of Commissioners meeting for zoning that we be in brief recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8135)|
| 2:15:40| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| The motion is properly before us to briefly recess this meeting of the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8143)|
| 2:15:49| of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8150)|
| 2:15:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| We are in brief recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8156)|
| 2:16:04| I call from recess to order this, the meeting of the Board of Commissioners of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8164)|
| 2:16:19| for the month of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| Commissioner Anders, you had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| Do you wish to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion, get us back in session, make a motion to approve the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8186)|
| 2:16:33| Motion and second properly before us to resume discussion for the approval of the item, Resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8193)|
| 2:16:45| 604, page 19, that is currently now then before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| Commissioner Anders, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| Chris, if you don't care to come back up, I'd really, you know, we go back and we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8213)|
| 2:17:00| about the past and we're, you know, four years ago the people that were advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| for Rural Metro are now advocating against this and so I guess it really the flip of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| the coin, but what are you doing today that you weren't doing at the time of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| and what is Rural Metro doing that goes above and beyond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| What can you tell us that makes us want to make this contract extend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| We've added additional resources, see that shows through the improvement in our statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8243)|
| 2:17:37| Are we better today than we were in response times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8257)|
| 2:17:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| So month to date, we were hovering about 90%, we've never been below 90% for the response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8262)|
| 2:17:50| time compliance, but today, as of this morning, we're up over 93%, so that's due to additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8270)|
| 2:17:59| resources being on the street every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8279)|
| 2:18:04| The morale has improved dramatically in the workforce because the overtime has been reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8284)|
| 2:18:14| Four years ago, it was commonplace to have holdovers to cover hours and holdovers still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8294)|
| 2:18:21| happen, it's part of the business unfortunately, crews get late calls, but overall, we're much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8301)|
| 2:18:28| better at getting people off on time, have happier staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8308)|
| 2:18:36| Our training, availability of additional training from our staff has really increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8316)|
| 2:18:46| I think the doctor behind you would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| Dr. Roger Brooksbank, again at Gallows Point Drive, been medical director for Rural Metro since 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| and I'm going to say Rural Metro because that's where I started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| I hope to believe that every day that I've been working with the service, we continue to get better every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8340)|
| 2:19:06| I hope that we'll be better tomorrow than we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| We do a multitude to try to improve things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| For example, he talked about the EMR that we've added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| The EMR is a tablet-based computerized record that we were going to be able to pinpoint where certain calls are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8355)|
| 2:19:22| For example, if we have a situation where we have 50% of our cardiac arrest at one location or one center of one location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8362)|
| 2:19:30| we'll be able to better pinpoint that and be able to respond better and quicker in those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8370)|
| 2:19:36| A couple things to try to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| If you look at things like we like to measure things in the clinical world, we like to measure performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8378)|
| 2:19:44| If you look at today, if someone calls and is having a stroke in our region, for the last two years at one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8384)|
| 2:19:51| comprehensive stroke centers, which is Fort Sanders Regional, it takes 40 minutes for that patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| after the phone call is made, to get from that house to Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8396)|
| 2:20:03| which is a comprehensive stroke center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| If they decide that they want to go by private vehicle, the numbers that we see are two hours and 41 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8405)|
| 2:20:12| So a substantial difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| You talked a little bit about 911 and calling an ambulance or calling whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| It's a complex thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| When you pick up the phone and call 911, those calls may be, I've been shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| Well, if I've been shot, I send a police, I may send a fire department, and I may send an EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8426)|
| 2:20:32| It's complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| If I call and I say, I've fallen out of bed and I need assistance to get to the bed, I have no chest pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8434)|
| 2:20:40| I have no pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| I have no hip pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| I have no other complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| It may be a first responders that do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| Again, depending on what the call is, depending on how the complexity of the 911 center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| and the protocols that we've written to be able to provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| I just kind of really wanted to just make a statement and let the public and people who are watching at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8466)|
| 2:21:14| know that we, all 11 commissioners, have received letters from Ralph McGill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8474)|
| 2:21:21| the mayor from Town of Farragut, from our sheriff, Jimmy J.J. Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8481)|
| 2:21:27| and also from our Knox County mayor, Tim Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| Also from every single hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| And as you all know, Knox County is very blessed with the multiple hospitals that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8497)|
| 2:21:45| We probably have more hospitals in our area than any county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8505)|
| 2:21:51| I'd probably put our county up with having more facilities than anybody in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| So with that to be said, we've had letters from UT Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| from the Tenova, from all of their facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| and also from Covenant, which a lot of people still call Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8525)|
| 2:22:14| Also we've gotten one from Eddie Maness, who is overtaking our veterans two and three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8534)|
| 2:22:23| We've gotten one from our city mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| And the list just continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| So I just wanted to make that known to the public that we have received letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8548)|
| 2:22:34| from all of these people asking us to extend this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8554)|
| 2:22:40| And just one thing I thought I might mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| because of all the confusion about rural metro, which is fire, first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8565)|
| 2:22:52| our ambulance services and all, all those calls get called in to 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| And then it's 9-1-1 that makes the decision to dispatch what particular vehicles or first responders and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8579)|
| 2:23:09| And so maybe if this is a real problem that continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8589)|
| 2:23:16| maybe we can discuss that with our 9-1-1 board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| and see if there's a way of even making it more clear, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8600)|
| 2:23:26| And that's just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| That seems to be a real issue with some complaining about double bills and rural metro, first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8607)|
| 2:23:36| I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| My heart goes out to every single one of the men and women who are in this line of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8620)|
| 2:23:46| And I highly respect you and I thank you every day for what you do, because it is a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8626)|
| 2:23:55| And there are things that you all see and that you all come in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8635)|
| 2:23:59| that most of us will never, ever see or have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8639)|
| 2:24:04| It takes true people that have been called, really called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8644)|
| 2:24:11| This is a calling to be able to do what you all do, because you don't know what you're going into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| And so I truly respect you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8658)|
| 2:24:22| And I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| I know you all don't get paid what you certainly deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| And so it's a very serious thing that I take and I just truly appreciate all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8668)|
| 2:24:37| Can I just mention something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| So our local response to Hurricane Harvey, we've sent 20 EMTs and paramedics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8680)|
| 2:24:48| from the Tennessee operations this morning to participate in the search and rescue operations in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8688)|
| 2:24:57| So we've got 16 of our NOx employees right now in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| So please consider them in your thoughts and prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| And we're preparing a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| We'll be deploying more folks throughout the course of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8709)|
| 2:25:13| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| Thank you for bringing that up, and that is exactly where it's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8716)|
| 2:25:24| I couldn't be more prouder last night when I saw the states that were helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| and when Tennessee, when they mentioned Tennessee and had our state lit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| And that is what we're all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| And you all were very good at going up in the severe fires and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| So that is, we're blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| We're blessed to have all of our first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| AMR has an agreement, a nationwide agreement with FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| We're the only provider of their ambulance services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| and we've got vehicles and personnel deployed from across the country to this event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8754)|
| 2:26:00| to support the efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| I have to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| I had a question from back from the presenting of questions from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8766)|
| 2:26:14| I know we had discussion of emergency care and fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| but those are really outside of the contract that we're looking at what's being provided by AMR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8778)|
| 2:26:28| or maybe who's going to end up owning AMR and merging to other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8788)|
| 2:26:36| But the question that I had was on the ten new ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8796)|
| 2:26:43| Is the number of ambulances in Knox County up ten or did some be retired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8803)|
| 2:26:51| About four years ago, we were just about 60 ambulances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8811)|
| 2:26:57| and now we've got 75 in our fleet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8820)|
| 2:27:01| So there's been some rotation of ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8821)|
| 2:27:08| And I don't remember what made me write this down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8828)|
| 2:27:14| but the reason for this contract we need to reemphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| is the fact that we expect response time in Knox County as a result of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8838)|
| 2:27:27| That's the reason the contract is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| Saying that it has some complexity with it, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8850)|
| 2:27:34| may lend itself to is there's some complexities now that did not exist five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8854)|
| 2:27:41| and I will just leave that laying on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| The expectation is for good service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| As now continuing on to the statements that were read by Commissioner Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8867)|
| 2:27:54| that's what's expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| Good service is what is expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| It's not necessarily a derogatory remark to say that AMR providing excellent service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8879)|
| 2:28:11| that we're looking for a different contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| That's not what we're about here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| So continuing on, I believe that it was Commissioner Gill that has had her light on a time or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8897)|
| 2:28:23| So Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| I would agree with your complexities and the five-year contract in the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8907)|
| 2:28:32| but I also have to recognize this, because although I don't agree with a five-year contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8912)|
| 2:28:38| and we should look at one-year increments, I want to make the observation of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8918)|
| 2:28:43| that what is critical to this community are the men and women sitting in this audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8923)|
| 2:28:49| That is your point of service, the service, the needs of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| and that is what really is quite remarkable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8933)|
| 2:28:59| We're looking at response times, but I understand where the rubber meets the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8939)|
| 2:29:04| and those are the men and women that are sitting here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8944)|
| 2:29:09| I believe that was Commissioner Nystrom is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8949)|
| 2:29:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| One question, I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8954)|
| 2:29:15| We do have a letter in support of the extension from the Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8955)|
| 2:29:21| and one of the statements is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| I can assure you, Commissioners, that the problems we were dealing with 18 months ago are no longer problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8963)|
| 2:29:28| We work together, put public safety first, and jointly resolve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8968)|
| 2:29:34| My eyesight is not perfect beyond a certain level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| and I can't tell if the Sheriff or any representatives from the Sheriff's Department are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| but I wanted to give the Sheriff's Department an opportunity to chime in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| Is there a representative from the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8985)|
| 2:29:50| Are they already gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| All right, already gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| Well, Dr. Buchanan, is this something that you could address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=8995)|
| 2:30:00| Can someone address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| My question was just around working with the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| Around rural metro running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| They'll have to answer that, how they work with the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| All right, thank you, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| So we've developed regular meetings with the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| We've been meeting with the Knox Police Department and Knox Fire as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| building relationships and working through day-to-day logistical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| So I believe the open doors of communication over the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| have really improved the relationship and the service that we're providing one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9033)|
| 2:30:40| Thank you, and kind of a point of reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| I also want to echo what Commissioner Daley said last week at our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9043)|
| 2:30:47| This is one of the hardest votes I think we've had this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| I know we've all put a lot of emotional and mental energy into analyzing this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9050)|
| 2:30:58| And I guess I'll want to second what Commissioner Daley said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| This has been one of the hardest decisions that we've all had to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| So I know me personally, I've put a lot of thought into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| I've got a lot of friends on all sides of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| both in the audience as well as on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| And I think when we're done, either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| we're going to have a good service for our residents here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9079)|
| 2:31:24| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| Building on what Commissioner Nystrom says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| that is what we are building for, the best service that we can have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9089)|
| 2:31:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| Following Commissioner Nystrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9099)|
| 2:31:42| I wanted to bring your attention to the letter that was in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9102)|
| 2:31:46| from the Town of Farragut Mayor, Ralph McGill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9106)|
| 2:31:52| I won't read the whole letter, but I think the first paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| if you do have a copy with you while I'm talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| you're welcome to read the balance of the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| But it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9120)|
| 2:32:01| The Town of Farragut has utilized Rural Metro for our fire and emergency responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9121)|
| 2:32:06| since the inception of the town in 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9126)|
| 2:32:10| We have performed those services seamlessly as first responders of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9130)|
| 2:32:16| and they work closely with our staff and with the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| in making sure our citizens are well served and taken care of in case of an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9141)|
| 2:32:27| And also, we may kind of overlook Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| but they are part of our area for service for ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| In our audience tonight, we do have an alderman with the Town of Farragut present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| Louise Poblin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| So if anybody has a question regarding the town's position on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| I'm sure she would make herself available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| Let me reemphasize that we are not looking to re-bid to degrade service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9172)|
| 2:32:58| The inspiration that we have behind us at County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9178)|
| 2:33:03| is to make sure that good service is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| Now I think we've finished round one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| unless there's someone who's been missed in round one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| The first issue I mentioned was billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9201)|
| 2:33:25| Billing, what we have in contract with Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9205)|
| 2:33:30| Someone said about the response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| Let me read you what's in the contract for arrival at an incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| It's in the contract here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| It says, means the time that the ALS ambulance crew or ALS first responder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9219)|
| 2:33:46| notifies the 911 center that the ambulance or first responder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9226)|
| 2:33:52| arrives at the parking position at the scene of the incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9232)|
| 2:33:57| It doesn't say 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| It doesn't say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| It says the time when they arrive, the first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| So if you're needing an ambulance service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| the first responder is called or is recognized as an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9247)|
| 2:34:11| And the time from what I read here stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| I wanted to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| The other question is that we beat around the bush with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| who do we have the contract with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| Do we have it with the fire department or do we have it with the ambulance service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| If we have it with the ambulance service, when you call for an incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| the thing that you charge should be $755.25 plus $8.73 per mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9271)|
| 2:34:43| Now that's what I'm questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| I'm not questioning about their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| I'm not questioning about their training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| I'm not questioning anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| I'm saying that $14.50 that that first responder that they utilized to take care of their contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9291)|
| 2:35:00| is, in my opinion, not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| If they're using that as that, it should be $755.25 per contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9304)|
| 2:35:11| I don't want to hear any more about all these magical things that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| I'm not questioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| I'm not questioning the people in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| What are they to be charged if they're not members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9320)|
| 2:35:23| And this states what they should be charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9323)|
| 2:35:27| No more, no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| And I want just clarification, something written in here that says you call up for an ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9330)|
| 2:35:36| if the first responder shows up, it's $755.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| If the ambulance service gets there later, that's all they're charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| because it says all encompassing in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9342)|
| 2:35:46| I'm not questioning your ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| I'm not questioning all the other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| I am questioning the billing, what our constituents, what our community is being charged for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9351)|
| 2:35:59| and what they should pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| Now, that's the flat end of my conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9361)|
| 2:36:05| No more of this other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| I understand you do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| I've had compliments about the way they do service out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| What are our people being billed for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9373)|
| 2:36:18| And if it's a first responder, which is in the contract right here, $755.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9378)|
| 2:36:26| Plus mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9386)|
| 2:36:28| No more, no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| But they're being paid just like one of my constituents came out here and got up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9390)|
| 2:36:35| He was billed $14.50 per call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9395)|
| 2:36:39| This is the contract we have with them that says that's the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9399)|
| 2:36:44| Now, in here they say about the time that they arrival in here, I'm reading here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9404)|
| 2:36:50| there's no thing in here talking about the time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| That's no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| The big deal is these people that are out there, like you say, that takes a gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9416)|
| 2:37:02| And some people don't have the money to gamble, don't have the money to pay for some of these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9422)|
| 2:37:09| So what are they to be charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| Now, the ambulance service, and you say, well, if they can't pay the $755,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9431)|
| 2:37:16| but if they have insurance, whether it's Medicare or any other insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| normally that insurance will pay the bill because that's why they bill the other end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9440)|
| 2:37:27| It's this other bill, the $14.50 that they get, that's under a fire that they can't file their insurance on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9447)|
| 2:37:37| Now, what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| Are we going to extend this contract and let them continue to bill the property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9458)|
| 2:37:45| Or are we going to have them talk to them about how you're going to bill for their service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9465)|
| 2:37:50| Like I said, I'm sitting here and hearing all this other stuff, and it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9470)|
| 2:37:55| You're a great service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| I'm not going to argue that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| I'm arguing about the billing, billing period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| Can we clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| Can we put it, do we have to write a new contract to verify that billing, that that's what there's to be charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9486)|
| 2:38:13| Are they going to read something in it that's not specifically stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| Do we have to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| To me, we have to address that in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9500)|
| 2:38:23| No more, no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| I'm not arguing about their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9505)|
| 2:38:28| I'm arguing about the billing, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| So I'll make my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9511)|
| 2:38:32| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9512)|
| 2:38:33| Can I just clarify something about the fire billing for medical calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9513)|
| 2:38:37| Is the fire billing, is billing for rural metro fire responding to a part of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9517)|
| 2:38:53| Or are we looking at it from it helps us reset the clock as we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9533)|
| 2:38:59| I just say that and I'm trying to measure now what your response to Commissioner Bussel is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9539)|
| 2:39:06| Rural metro fire, and Jerry, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9546)|
| 2:39:10| Rural metro fire doesn't bill for medical response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9550)|
| 2:39:13| So if they go to a heart attack as a first responder, they do not bill that party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9553)|
| 2:39:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9558)|
| 2:39:19| It's only for fire responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9559)|
| 2:39:22| And as we've talked this evening, we had a person show up with four bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9562)|
| 2:39:31| which I believe the word used was they were forgiven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9571)|
| 2:39:38| The person that owns the real estate may not have known that before tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9578)|
| 2:39:49| I'm going to go off track for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9589)|
| 2:39:52| Commissioner Carringer brought up several letters today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9592)|
| 2:40:02| This is before us last Monday, and I thought it was short-sticked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9602)|
| 2:40:06| For someone to be responding to us today saying we should approve this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9606)|
| 2:40:13| because AMR or who may be buying AMR as a good provider over the last few months, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9613)|
| 2:40:22| But it's because of that indecision that I think we find ourselves with this long, drawn-out discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9622)|
| 2:40:31| of what's taking place here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| The question about billing is a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9634)|
| 2:40:41| And it may be a question that can be resolved tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| But does that place it in the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| And I think the answer to that question is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9646)|
| 2:40:51| So I don't know that I asked a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| I was just making a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9656)|
| 2:40:57| I need to go to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| Well, I think I'll answer the question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9659)|
| 2:41:04| Again, three years ago I asked this commission to sit and look at the emergency services provided in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9664)|
| 2:41:12| And that committee sat on their hands and let it die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| And now here we are talking about emergency service response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| And nobody has said a word for the last 24 months about anything, about response, about fire, about ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9680)|
| 2:41:28| about anything in the last 24 months until we start talking about rural metro, AMR, contract extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9688)|
| 2:41:37| Now everybody is disgusted with their service or their billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| A BLS call, I think it would behoove every commissioner, if you haven't, and I think most of you have not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9701)|
| 2:41:49| go to 911 and watch the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9709)|
| 2:41:52| Watch the call taker transfer the call to either fire or EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9712)|
| 2:41:57| Go on a ride along with EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9717)|
| 2:42:01| You're sitting up here taking advice from PR people and from other people when you have no idea about the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9721)|
| 2:42:09| and the only thing you see is one side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| I've been on both sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| I've had issues with rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| Our sheriff, our chief, our mayor have had issues with rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9736)|
| 2:42:21| But in the last two years is the only time those issues have been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9741)|
| 2:42:26| The rest of the time I was ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| I was the chairman of the commission and I got ignored by the previous administration of rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9748)|
| 2:42:33| And I was even on scenes when those things happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| I had a very good understanding of everything that we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9755)|
| 2:42:41| But in the last 24 months, nobody has said a word until tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9761)|
| 2:42:46| And then here we are all up in arms when I asked you three years ago to look at emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9766)|
| 2:42:53| Fire service in Knox County can't sustain where it's at right now by the $400,000, $500,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9773)|
| 2:43:02| Our rescue squad, who if rural metro fire wasn't here, our rescue squad would have to go pick up everybody out of the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9782)|
| 2:43:09| There's no more volunteers to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| The only thing they've got right now is technical services and their partnership with rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| So be mad all you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9798)|
| 2:43:21| Be upset all you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9801)|
| 2:43:22| I asked you to look at it three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| You've said nothing for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| And here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| That's all I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| I do not know which of you two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9812)|
| 2:43:33| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9813)|
| 2:43:34| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9814)|
| 2:43:36| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| I just wanted to say that, again, everything you said about all these qualified, great employees, I had no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9819)|
| 2:43:50| So, I mean, I applaud everything you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9830)|
| 2:43:54| My concern is really the flux of the situation with investment bankers buying it and what kind of service we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9834)|
| 2:44:02| I wish this was going to be a year from now so we could see exactly what was going to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| instead of guessing what's going to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| But, again, I want to reiterate, I know all these men and women do a fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9852)|
| 2:44:19| I never had a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9859)|
| 2:44:23| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| I have one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| Three years ago, there was only two people sitting on this dais that had conversations about this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9870)|
| 2:44:41| Three years ago, there was only two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Wright and Mr. Chairman, former Chairman Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9885)|
| 2:44:58| The rest of us haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| So for you to make that blanket statement that three years ago I was arguing this before all of us, we weren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9900)|
| 2:45:09| Were you on the fire committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| Were you on the fire committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| The fire committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9915)|
| 2:45:23| We've had this before us for five business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9923)|
| 2:45:29| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| I just have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| Twenty-four months ago, I wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| And with the nature of all county business, I'm here to do my due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| and to serve the needs and interests of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9940)|
| 2:45:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9942)|
| 2:45:46| And Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9946)|
| 2:45:51| Before we vote, I just wanted to compliment Martha Buchanan on her efforts regarding this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9951)|
| 2:45:58| She's reached out to me numerous times, and I'm sure to all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9958)|
| 2:46:03| but she really did a fantastic job in trying to help walk us through this and answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9963)|
| 2:46:11| And I really, really appreciate what you did for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| I wanted to speak for just a moment to the aspect of PR people putting pressure on commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9975)|
| 2:46:22| One of the things that commissioners have to do is to look at pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9982)|
| 2:46:28| You have to look at getting letters from people of endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9988)|
| 2:46:36| There are a lot of things that have to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| One of the issues that I perceive to be about the largest issue we have before us is that this came Monday after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=9998)|
| 2:46:55| as Commissioner Andrews would say, no conversations going on before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10015)|
| 2:47:02| as to whether or not it should be this, that, or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10022)|
| 2:47:08| I got home last Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| My wife wanted to throw me back out in the yard because I was irritated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10030)|
| 2:47:17| It must have been I missed supper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| Tonight I brought supper with me, so it's under the counter here, and I'm satisfied myself tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10040)|
| 2:47:29| But I looked at it a different way last Monday evening when my wife asked me, the staff asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10049)|
| 2:47:39| well, who are you going to talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10059)|
| 2:47:42| And I said the last people I'll talk to will be the ones that call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10062)|
| 2:47:48| The people that I'm going to talk to are I will place myself in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10068)|
| 2:47:54| at least three times a day for the next week with someone who doesn't know where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10074)|
| 2:48:07| And I satisfied that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| In fact, on some days I spoke to five people or five organizations or five opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10090)|
| 2:48:18| I only want to use three tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10098)|
| 2:48:21| One is the guy that maintains the John Deere tractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10101)|
| 2:48:31| And for those of you that do not know Grady Lead, he does not maintain his tractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10111)|
| 2:48:39| He's got somebody that maintains them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| And his comment was, you've got to look at things every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10121)|
| 2:48:48| I was in a doctor's office Friday morning at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10128)|
| 2:48:53| That's a.m., 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| I missed the meeting that I had scheduled with Commissioner Daley at 9.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10135)|
| 2:49:03| I asked the guy sitting catty-cornered to me who was in Bermuda shorts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10143)|
| 2:49:08| had a lot better retirement tan than I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10148)|
| 2:49:14| who was asked by the nurse that came to get him to say, tell me how old you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| I guess that's a question to see whether or not he knew who he was, and he was 82-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10160)|
| 2:49:26| He was working a crossword puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10166)|
| 2:49:30| I interrupted him and asked, what do you think of the ambulance contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10170)|
| 2:49:36| He looked over his glasses and said, don't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| After a little bit of conversation, his response to me was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10180)|
| 2:49:46| that's what you get paid the big bucks for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10186)|
| 2:49:51| And then Saturday evening I was in attendance at the most important contract that's ever made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10191)|
| 2:50:02| A young couple entering into wedded life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10202)|
| 2:50:09| I asked the aunt of the bride, what do you think of the ambulance contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10209)|
| 2:50:17| Her response was, I've never had to call for a fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10217)|
| 2:50:26| There are several of those down the list, but the most important one that I need to bring to you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10226)|
| 2:50:35| is the contract compliance engineer in Oak Ridge in charge of transporting nuclear waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10235)|
| 2:50:48| When I described what was before Knox County at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10248)|
| 2:50:54| he said that contract looks like to me that Knox County is not in the procurement business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10254)|
| 2:51:02| It looks like the ambulance services of the United States is the people that's in the procurement business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10262)|
| 2:51:10| Now we can be bought out one time and get a good contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| We've been bought out and there was tough times at rural metro several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10274)|
| 2:51:21| And it's in the process now of changing hands again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| So let me say what the contract compliance nuclear engineer said in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10284)|
| 2:51:31| It looks like Knox County is not in the procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| It looks like the ambulance authorities are in the procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| Which brings me to one last point that's been hit upon a couple of times here just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10301)|
| 2:51:49| The vice chair is seated here, is up for re-election, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10309)|
| 2:51:56| You're up for re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| I can't talk to him so I want to make sure I was right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10319)|
| 2:52:02| He's up for re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| Did he have any input into the contract that's on the table today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10324)|
| 2:52:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| I think he'd be lucky enough and honorable enough to be re-elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10332)|
| 2:52:17| Will he have any input into the contract that's in effect for the next five years if we extend what's on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10337)|
| 2:52:28| We won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10348)|
| 2:52:31| We seated commissioners are term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10351)|
| 2:52:39| And here's going to be a two-term commissioner with no input into the technicalities, the complexities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10359)|
| 2:52:46| the verbiage, the billing, the whatever that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10366)|
| 2:52:53| And his eight years in office, any input into the ambulance service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10373)|
| 2:53:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10382)|
| 2:53:03| That's all I've got to say about where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| It has nothing to do with rural metro, AMR, whoever, whoever, the good employees of the carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10386)|
| 2:53:15| There are several people seated here that have been in the ambulance business in Knox County for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10395)|
| 2:53:22| Somebody is going to be in the ambulance business here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10402)|
| 2:53:26| and I would hope that AMR or whoever their successors are would be sufficiently knowledgeable of the contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10406)|
| 2:53:38| that needs to be taking place and that they could be the successful bidder if this contract were to be reopened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10418)|
| 2:53:50| I've gone a long way here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| This is not PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10432)|
| 2:53:55| This is citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10435)|
| 2:53:59| Well, I'll take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| One that I happened to hit on was in Norris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10441)|
| 2:54:08| But all the rest of the 28, 30 people that I have talked to, everyone has asked me to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10448)|
| 2:54:18| And by the way, I didn't realize I had folders here from Illuminator, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10458)|
| 2:54:26| the politicals of Knox County saying that I needed to approve this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10466)|
| 2:54:32| So I'm going to only recognize Commissioner Bussler because the question has been called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| Commissioner Bussler, give me 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10478)|
| 2:54:43| Three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10483)|
| 2:54:44| I'm a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| I told the people when I was running for office I'd represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10486)|
| 2:54:49| They have problems with billing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| So I'm representing them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| The question is billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| That's the main issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| When you sit in front of a little 85-year-old lady that's got her second notice that's threatening to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10498)|
| 2:55:06| or you get a call from a bill collector that says this bill has been turned over to them to collect the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10506)|
| 2:55:19| or this bill for the fire truck, I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10519)|
| 2:55:26| I'm representing that lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10526)|
| 2:55:27| I want you to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| I'm not against rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| I'm not against trying to sit down in front of a lady to calm her down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10533)|
| 2:55:38| when she's 85 years old thinking she's losing her house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| The next thing is I'm going to tell you I had a good response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| Rural metro has come a long ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| When I first moved where I'm at now, ISO was a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10548)|
| 2:55:54| Now it's a 2, and my insurance pays for all that protection that I'm getting from them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10554)|
| 2:56:01| That's not always the case when you live way out in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10561)|
| 2:56:06| Those are the people that I'm representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| Am I passionate about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| If I get upset about it, that's right, I will get upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| When you get the person that gets four bills for $14.50, he's not even at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10573)|
| 2:56:21| Now, what he said about that, what did he say, the way that they bill for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10581)|
| 2:56:29| did you know if they used that premise that you're not home, you're on vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10589)|
| 2:56:35| somebody wrecks in your yard, somebody calls 911 and they come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10595)|
| 2:56:38| and they send a first responder, ambulance service, whatever, out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10598)|
| 2:56:42| when you get back, you could be billed for both the ambulance service and the fire service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10602)|
| 2:56:47| or both of them together, and you're not even home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10607)|
| 2:56:51| You're not even there by that assumption that he's using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10611)|
| 2:56:55| But, having said that, we've got to make sure that our citizens are not upset by the service we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10615)|
| 2:57:06| and we've got to make this language in this properly that we know what they're going to be billed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10626)|
| 2:57:11| That's it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170828?start=10634)|
