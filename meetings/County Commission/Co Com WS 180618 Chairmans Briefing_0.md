| 0:00:30| Thank you, everybody, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| How this meeting came about is I often go to lunch with Chris and sometimes Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=33)|
| 0:00:39| and Chris approached me about having Mark come and give us a presentation on bonds, TIFs, and pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=39)|
| 0:00:46| because those are some of the most important things we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| In a lot of ways, they're very simple, and in a lot of ways, they're very, very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| And Chris, do you want to step forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=54)|
| 0:01:01| I'll take this time to introduce Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| If you have never met Mark, you're in for a treat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=64)|
| 0:01:07| His dry sense of humor is wonderful, so be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| Mark is the bond counsel for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| He can explain what that is when he gets up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| That means he charges you for stuff, but he does a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| He's probably one of the leading experts in TIFs and pilots across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| and so a lot of times the legislature will turn to him when they have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| He also has a really good ñ he does all of our ñ let's see, he's our bond counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| That means every time we issue bonds, he's reviewing those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| He can also talk about one issue that's on your agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| It's where we've got a ñ not a refunding, but we've got a reissue of a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| He can talk to you about how everybody was talking about the new tax legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| how positive it was, what has a negative impact on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| because it doesn't allow us to do refundings in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| He can explain that and tell you how that will negatively impact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| And so without further ado, I'll give you Mark Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Or Chairman Smith, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| You just call me Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| That's what you always call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| This is a thrill to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Can you pull the mic down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Yeah, let me pull my mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| I'm not nearly as tall as our next speaker, I guess, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| No, he's about my size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| It seriously is an honor to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| I speak about economic development a lot all over the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| and this is the first chance I've really had to talk to my own hometown commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| I'm pointing at Randy because Randy and I grew up in Timbercrest together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| good bearded guy, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| But, yeah, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| But, yeah, we're bearded bulldogs and enjoyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| I didn't know Randy, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| He was much younger is what he likes to tell me beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| But it really is a privilege to get to come talk to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| And there are so many things to talk about today that I could really talk several hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| And Randy texted me Friday night and said, please, just talk for an hour at most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| And then if they have any questions, which he thought was not very likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| because he probably would have been so bored by then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| that we could spend a half an hour answering questions if you all are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| And talking about specific deals, if you want, I'd love to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| I get to work all over the state on TIFs and pilots and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| I always like to act like John Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| I tell people from Mountain City to Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| I get to do economic incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| And that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| I've done one in Mountain City, and I've done them in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| So it's a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| But before we dive into incentives, I thought we would talk a little bit, as Chris mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| about just when you issue debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Because I know it comes in front of you a lot, and you all probably understand it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| But just so in case it helps at all, I hope that if I tell you a little bit about why you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| what you're being asked to do, maybe it will give you a little color to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| So there's two real types of debt that you all are asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| One is GO bonds, just regular bonds that we do most years for you all for school projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| and other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| So almost every year as part of your budget resolution, you'll have a debt resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| You've been paying off a lot of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| So net, you're not really adding any debt for a number of years or a small amount of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| But often you're borrowing for new purposes because you're doing significant capital expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| So you'll see a bond resolution come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| And the other type of borrowing is a conduit bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| It's sort of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| This building, this city county building, the public building authorities of the world were formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| to do this very building that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Public building authorities are a special kind of entity that was created to essentially administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| public facilities across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| And in a collaborative effort, Knoxville and Knox County got together and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| Sort of the bond lawyers from Chicago that used to do a lot of work in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| before our firm started doing most of the deals in the state wrote this legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| and we've now lived and breathed it for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| And it's a way for cities and counties to collaborate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| but it's also a way for you to be able to borrow money through what we call a conduit issuer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| And I'll talk to you a little bit about why you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Because you do have on your agenda this time the extension of one of these PBA financings coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| In your last agenda, you had a traditional general obligation bond resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| So I'm going to give you my little slides if you go down to my chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| So why would you ever use a public building authority instead of doing bonds yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| Well, the reason people do it are two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| One, and this is the big one, is variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| Many big communities like Nashville and Memphis and obviously Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| believe that it's in their best interest to have some amount of variable rate debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| because normally if you keep good fund balances, which you do here at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| Ed's always squirreling away a lot of money over there in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| You're hopefully making decent investment earnings on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| and so it often makes sense to do some variable rate debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| because you can sort of effectively hedge that by having some variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| You cannot do variable rate debt directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| You have to do it for legal reasons through a public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| So the matter that's in front of you this week was a variable rate bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| that has now been purchased by a bank, and it still is floating along at a very low variable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| But when the tax laws changed counterintuitively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| when the rates went down so that the corporate income tax rate went down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| from 35% down to the low 20s, your interest rate went up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| because even the bank, its return went down because the tax benefit of holding those bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| and the bank sort of felt guilty, so they came to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| hey, we'll extend this loan and we'll lower your rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| And Chris and his team negotiated that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| and so what's in front of you all on commission this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| is essentially just authorizing the paperwork that needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| to lower the interest rate on that variable rate debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| and to extend the period that the bank can ask for the debt to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| So it is a pretty simple transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| and it's somewhat informational to keep you all posted on those sort of transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| The county, our county, has been conservative compared to some counties and cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| and has a good ratio of fixed and variable rate debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| but there are communities across the state that have almost 100% variable rate debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| and with interest rates rising, that's a pretty risky thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| and we should be really proud that we have not sort of gone down that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| And so also if you have a collaborative project like the city-county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| it often makes sense to use a public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| It was used for Thompson Bowling Arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| and it's been used widely across the state for those kind of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| So when you issue debt, you often may wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| why in the world does this Mammoth guy give me two resolutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| He gives me this short little resolution called an initial resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| and then there's this long bond resolution, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| And so the short resolution is what's called the initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| That's a resolution that we, after you all adopt it, we put it in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| and the public have 20 days to object to the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| They can go run out, and if they can get 10% of the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| from the last election to sign a petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| they could put that bond issue to referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| I've been doing this about 30 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| and I've only seen maybe three referendums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| and probably all of them were in Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| because they love to have referenda in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| But I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| But at least a couple of them have been in Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| and it's very, very rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| If you have only a school project, it can't be referended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| In other words, if you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| we're going to build a new high school and issue school bonds for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| general obligation school bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| legally they're not entitled to do a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| But almost always we combine school projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| with other recreational projects and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| so most of your bond issues are subject to referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| And when we do that initial resolution, it goes in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| and I'm never aware of any effort to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| And it's been a long, long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| since I think there's been a referendum on anything here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| The Titan Stadium Coliseum, I guess as they call it in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| actually went to referendum and passed about 55-45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| It's one of the bigger referenda on this sort of thing that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| So once that 20-day referendum passes, then we can move forward to closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| Usually we ask you to adopt the bond resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| at the same time as the initial resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| so you all can take up all the matters in the same agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| but the bond resolution says you can't move forward until that 20 days passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| So once those 20 days pass, then we can move forward with your bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Your bonds are sold by competitive sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| In other words, they go and they put them on an Internet platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| It's like eBay for bond lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| It goes and they put them up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| and usually a strong county like Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| you probably get five to ten bidders for your bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| All the big underwriting firms want to sell your bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| And so you look and you pick the one, obviously, that gives you the lowest interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| You accept that bid, and then usually we have about two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| to get all the paperwork together to close the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| And so that's sort of the process when you issue bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| So who are the people involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| Well, there's your financial advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| You all have hired two under a RFP process, PFM and Commonwealth Securities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| and Chris and his team have been using them for various aspects of the county's deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| Then you have bond counsel, and we were hired under an RFP process a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| Bond counsel is probably the only person in the world that finds this interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| but I'm going to tell you anyway what is bond counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Well, 100 years ago or so, railroads, really the late 1800s, as early as that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| railroads were going to a lot of communities and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| if you will issue bonds to pay for the railroad to come to your town, we will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| And so a lot of railroads did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| A lot of these railroads were fly-by-night operations, and they went bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| And the counties and cities issued bonds to help them got left holding the bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| Well, a lot of these counties and cities said, whoa, we didn't do this legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| We didn't have the authority to issue these railroad bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| And a lot of them just defaulted and said, we're not going to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| And all these rich Wall Street folks got left holding the bag with counties and cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| largely in the south and the Midwest, not paying for their bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| And so Wall Street said, we're not going to buy any more of these bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| unless you hire a lawyer experienced with municipal law to give us a legal opinion that these bonds are legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| And so back in the day, and this is sort of hilarious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| Richard Nixon's law firm was a big bond law firm back in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| John Mitchell, for those of you who are old enough to remember Nixon's attorney general who went to prison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| was the bond counsel for Knox County for a short period of time, way, way back when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| And so it's historically our law firm, which is, as I mentioned, we do most of the deals in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=737)|
| 0:12:26| probably about 70% of the cities and counties in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| We weren't really qualified to do this work until maybe the late 60s or early 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| But for many, many years before that, it was dominated by firms out of New York and Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| And so our role is to, again, give an opinion that the bonds are legally issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| And what also became very important is we have to give an opinion that the interest on the bonds is tax exempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| unless you intentionally do like a taxable deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| Like the pension bond issues we've done a couple for you all are taxable bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| The interest on them is not excludable for federal tax purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| But most of your deals are, and you might say, well, when would it not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| Well, it would be if you did it for private use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| In other words, if you did a bond issue that you were going to lease it to a private party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| and were going to pay it back from those lease payments, it would in most cases not be a tax exempt bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| So you're paying us to do the tax analysis and the legal analysis to make sure you jump through all the right hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| And then you have the underwriter, which in most cases buys the bonds by competitive sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| If you do a refinancing, they can actually buy them negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| A refinancing is a little bit different because you're trying to hit the market right at the best time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| So state law lets you negotiate with an underwriter instead of selling them at competitive sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| A paying agent is a pretty minor role, but when Chris needs to pay his bonds, he sends a wire to a bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| and the bank then disseminates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| And then DTC, which stands for Depository Trust Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| and I thought you might find this halfway interesting, is that historically bonds were those little pretty frilly sort of stuff, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| And those things don't even exist anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| All bonds are electronically entered in New York at an institution called Depository Trust Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| So if you buy a municipal bond, as you may know, your broker doesn't even hold the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| He just has an electronic debit of a municipal bond that's held at DTC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| And so DTC, we deliver typewritten bonds to the paying agent who holds them for the benefit of DTC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| and who actually is the holder of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| If you ever had to find out, you would have to find out from Depository Trust Company or DTC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| So Tennessee is a very good state for municipal finance for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| Our ratings for our entities are really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| If you go to Kentucky, for example, there's so many challenges to doing bonds in Kentucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| that most of their financing is done using lease purchase agreements, including like roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| Like they'll lease purchase a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| We don't lease purchase many roads in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| And one of the reasons we don't is we have no debt limits in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| A lot of states say that you cannot borrow more than a percentage of your assessed value in your county, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=908)|
| 0:15:17| So if our county had a billion dollars of assessed value, they might limit you to, say, $200 million of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| That's not true in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| There are absolutely no debt limits in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| Our charter has any debt limits, as many charters and cities do across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| State law trumps that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| State law says you can borrow on an unlimited basis, notwithstanding any debt charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| Oak Ridge has a limit on debt, and I get calls usually once every couple of years saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| but our charter says this, not to say, sorry, state law wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| As you talked about no debt limits, what do bonding agencies, the AAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| and what do they look at as a practical number for a bond debt for, say, a Knox County or a Hamilton County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=952)|
| 0:16:00| Well, I may have to defer a little bit to Chris on that because they just get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| So much of it depends, though, not only on there's not so much a magic number percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| because a lot of it depends on income growth and population growth and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| I mean, you may have low debt to assess value numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| but you may just have to be very poor county and have a hard time paying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Do you know what our numbers are, Chris, by chance, what our debt to assess value number is in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=986)|
| 0:16:36| I don't have a number, but we're considered above average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| In talking to Moody's this year, they're not overly concerned with our number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| and they compare it to your full valuation of your tax roll compared to your debt service amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| And with debt service, your total bonded indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| Is the rate not a factor in there, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| The rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Tax rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| No, actually not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| And so they just say full valuation of your tax roll compared to your total debt limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| They have a number in mind, but what helps us is we have a very healthy fund balance, which he mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1028)|
| 0:17:16| so that offsets that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| We have economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| They really like the fact that we have OR&L and Y-12 and UT and TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| and we have big city and county governments, so we don't see fluctuations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| So we have a lot more positives than we do negatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| They like the fact that they would consider us having strong management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| I should beat my chest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| But that's because we put policies in place to allow things to keep doing what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| which would be like a debt service policy and a fund balance policy and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| so we don't let things get really out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| And so for sure they would like that to be lowered, but I think what Mark said is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| You could be in a county with no debt, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| and you may have a B bond rating because you don't have any type of economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| So I think any time you're going to a county our size, you're going to have some debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Now, we can all agree or disagree what that level should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| but I think we've moved in the right direction because we know we have growth in our tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| and as that continues to grow, you know, if debt service was to stay about the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| then you're eventually going to get to a level that's where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| It's interesting to me, Brad, that places like Pigeon Forge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| which have essentially no property tax but live off sales taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| have almost comparable ratings as we do here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| And so it's hard to – each place is so unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| and many communities live off sales taxes versus off of property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| So each place is sort of unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| And my last thing I mentioned already is that, unlike a lot of states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| where you have to referenda almost any bond issue, we just don't have that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| And it really makes it – you guys are really the arbiter of who decides whether you're going to issue debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| And in very few cases do you have a referendum on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| So I'm going to move to – and, again, we're going to have a long Q&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| You kept that three-syllable word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Three-syllable word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Which one did I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Arbitrary, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Randy told me I had to limit to three-syllable words for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| So when we first started talking, Randy and I, about this, we've chatted a lot over the last couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| Randy and I have gotten together and talked about incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| as he's had questions about particular deals, as he was doing his due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| And so I spent a lot of time doing, as I mentioned earlier, pilots and tax abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| which also are really just tax abatement and tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| And in many states across the country there are a lot of tax credits against income taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1191)|
| 0:20:01| and various types of incentives that local jurisdictions can use to attract industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| and to encourage job growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| We're lucky in many ways that we live in a low-tax state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| We don't really have many taxes that we can credit things to, a little bit of franchise and excise tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| But when someone is doing a site selection search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| the first thing they're going to ask you about is tax abatement, if you're a big industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| They're going to want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| I know he's here, and he can certainly tell you a lot more about the real-world experience than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| But I see the site selection folks have well figured out that they have the leverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| if they have the jobs, to basically demand tax abatement for any significant industrial project that creates good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| And so historically PILOTs were for those purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| And PILOT, as you all may know, stands for payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| And as I said, it's sort of a misnomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Sorry, big word, but it is a – because often there is no payment in lieu of tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| It's zero, so that's kind of a lie to say that's a payment in lieu of tax because where's the payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| But there are a number of times, a lot of cities and counties across our region have programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| and Todd can certainly describe our program here, but where you start is a certain percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| and then move up over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| They vary greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| And then so PILOT, as we're talking this afternoon, just think of that as tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| You're basically providing an abatement of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| And TIFs, there is no abatement of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| The taxes are paid to Mr. Schaus, just like everybody else's taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| But when they come in, his office has the task of divvying up the taxes when they come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| and sending some of it to either KCDC or IDB if it's subject to a TIF and keeping the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| And we'll talk about what the rest is for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| So a TIF, again, keep in mind, no tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| It's a reallocation of tax increment revenue, and a PILOT is tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Could you distinguish between the two and when one is used and the other one is used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| Yeah, I have some slides on that if that's okay, like which is good for a PILOT and which one is good for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| Private owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Yes, and so if you don't mind, Randy, I'll pull a little background and then I'll hop into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| because it sort of helps do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| And one thing that's really, if I were in your old shoes, I'd say, wait a minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| Why am I, I mean, why don't people just come to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| We're the ones who set the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Why can't, when this big industry comes to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| why can't I just say we're going to give them a 30% abatement for ten years or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| Why do you have all this IDB junk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| and why do lawyers like you, Mamentoff, get involved other than it's nice that you can make a living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| and it's a lawyer's dream sort of thing that we had to go through all this paperwork?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Well, candidly, it's our constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| Our state constitution, not our federal constitution, says everyone in Tennessee has to be taxed equally, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| So if I own the same house David has, his taxes have to be the same as mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| even though he's on county commission, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| So you all can't cut him a break just because you like David better than you like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| But the same thing is true of an industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| If an industry comes to town, we have an existing industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| We can't cut their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| You guys can't vote to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| It would be unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Well, historically, everybody said, well, man, we can't compete in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| in the game of attracting industry if we can't abate property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| Largely started with Spring Hill and getting the Saturn plan a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| And so they were like, how are we going to get these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| How are we going to get around our own constitution to get this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Well, what entities are exempt under our state constitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Well, the biggest one are municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Obviously, you all don't pay any taxes on any county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Neither does the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| It is a municipal entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| It is your municipal entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| And any properties that it owns is exempt from taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| So somebody many years ago came up with the clever idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| well, we'll just convey properties that we want subject to tax abatement to the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| and they'll lease it back to the guy that we're trying to attract to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| So the property became exempt because it's nominally in the IDB's name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| but it's really owned by General Motors or Nissan or Volkswagen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| All those huge plants are owned by industrial development boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| I got a really big kick, if you all know the Kimberly-Clark plant over there in Lowndon County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| They did a pilot for about ten years or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| They forgot the IDB owned it, and their lease expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| So they actually had no ownership interest in their entire probably $200 million manufacturing plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| for several years before somebody happened to look at the deed and realized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| wait a minute here, we don't even own this property anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| And that happens a lot more than you might think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| But it's all driven by our Constitution, why we have to go through this pilot rigamarole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| instead of just doing it directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| In New York, you go to a commission and ask for abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| sort of like you all might set up a committee to say who really deserves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| Unfortunately, you can set the rules for who gets abatement through delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| and if you don't mind, my little next slide is about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| is you all get to decide for your industrial development board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| what authority they have to abate taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| You have to delegate to our IDB of Knox County the authority to negotiate a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| So years ago, Todd and his team presented pilot policies to you all that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| hey, if they meet these standards, we can grant this pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| And so you all approved those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| That was your delegation for manufacturing facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| But if it's not within those limits, then it has to come back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| And one thing that's been, and please don't boo and hiss me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| but the law is very clear on this, is the city and the county are separate in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| The city has its own IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| The city can delegate to their IDB to do a pilot, and it affects your taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| and the same thing is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| If you have a project that you want to help that's in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| and you delegate to the IDB, the city has no say-so over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| And recently there was some legislation that passed that limited certain retail projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| that if it's over a 10-year pilot for a retail project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| it has to go to the other governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| But other than that, it's free reign as to who can do what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| The only county that that's not true is Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| And, of course, Shelby County is always different, as is Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| But, yeah, otherwise they can do a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| But I'm really proud of our community because it's really worked well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| and Todd administers both boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| The county IDB is focused on major industrial projects and recruiting jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| and the city IDB is primarily focused on pilots for inner-city redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| And so even though there's not a legal reason for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| that's just sort of how things have fallen out in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| So I talked about the sale-leaseback structure and why it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| And, again, so when a company comes in and they own the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| they want their tax payment, they quit-claim the property through a deed to the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| and the IDB leases it back to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| and they pay no meaningful rent other than the commitment to make any pilot payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| Their real rent is their commitment to do the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Say I commit that I'm going to build a $10 million building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| and put in $50 million of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| That is the rent, typically, for that kind of project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| That's their commitment to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| And so the limits on pilots are you can't go over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| plus a construction period, without going to the state for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Rarely do we go to the state for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| because you've got to go running to the comptroller's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| and it takes a couple months to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| So you really don't want to do that unless it's a really extraordinary project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| I probably think ten or so projects I'm aware of in this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| have gone to them from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| and that they really are projects that are sort of earth-shattering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| I think we just did one last month for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Well, then you will have to go to the state if they get approval if it's over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| and it is through the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Which project was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| If it's over 20, you have to go to the comptroller's office for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| It's not hard as long as it's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| It was our own project at the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| Oh, it's for Todd's project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| I did know the Farriot Hotel project was 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| and they had to go get state approval for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Is that right, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| And so it's pretty rare, but it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| In certain projects, and this is important for downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| is that certain projects you cannot do a pilot for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| You cannot do pilots for single-family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| So if a developer comes to you and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| will you do a pilot for my residential development until I'm able to sell my lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| you do not have the legal authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| That's not an eligible project under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| And so a condo project is not eligible for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| That's why you see TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| and we'll talk about TIFs for downtown condo projects and not pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| You can do pilots for apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| and so that's why you often see pilots for apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| but you don't see TIFs as much for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| And so most capital projects are eligible for pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| but there are a few that you cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| And to me, single-family housing is probably the biggest one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| that people have asked me about over the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Often I get the question is, well, is there a minimum amount that we're ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| I mean, like a TIF, you're always going to get a minimum amount of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| With a pilot, there is no limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| In other words, you have the legal authority that you could give them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| let them pay zero for up to 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| without anybody else's approval plus a construction period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| So you have a lot of latitude in what you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| and if you should so choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| I think when IKEA came to Memphis, they gave them 30 years of full abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| And I don't know if you all saw this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| but IKEA was supposed to come to Nashville to Antioch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| and they just recently gave notice that they're canceling their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| They were going to do a whole special assessment district for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| We were working on it and got an email saying put your pens down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| because it is not happening right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| because IKEA has decided to go to more of a catalog model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| instead of the ‑‑ it's like a mousetrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| You follow arrows and you can never get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| until you've bought total amounts of goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| that you had no knowledge that you needed when you walked in the IKEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| but you left with all kind of Swedish meatballs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| that you didn't know you even liked until you tried some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| But that's a good example of a long pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| So TIFs are different in that, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| they are ‑‑ it's an allocation of property tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| You're dedicating a property tax revenue stream for a certain purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| and there are two main kinds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| And we're famous here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| because the IDBs could not do TIFs until 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| and your Chamber of Commerce is really ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| I love telling this story, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| At the time, they were wanting to do what Todd is asking you all to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| for the Carnes Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| If we successfully develop an industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| can we keep some incremental tax revenues to help pay for the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| Well, that was the goal of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| and because I was working on a lot of TIFs for KCDC already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| they said, hey, would you help us draft a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| to help us accomplish basically what Todd is asking you all to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| And I said, sure, you know, and we need it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| And I said, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| So I threw something together thinking surely it would get edited a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| Instead, it passed without somebody even changing a word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| which just fascinated me in the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| because I really didn't have time to do a thoughtful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| And so we've made a number of amendments to it since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| but that whole thing, IDB TIF, started here in Knox County for basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| so our development corporation could leverage the industrial parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| that they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| But it's now turned into something that is used all over the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| largely for retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| We are largely using it in smaller communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| who candidly are trying to compete with our community for retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| They're doing them for the food cities and the publics of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| trying to keep their retail base alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| We don't have that problem, as you all well know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| as much here in Knox County because people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| our income and size is good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| but a lot of smaller communities are fighting daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| to keep their retail base alive and to keep their sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| So IDB TIFs are largely used for greenfield development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| for shopping centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| done a little bit of manufacturing and warehousing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| but primarily it's been a retail phenomena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| And then my friend Ben Bentley is here from KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| You all may know Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| He's our executive director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| so I wanted to note that I appreciate him taking the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| But we use TIFs here in Knoxville largely for urban redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| and we've been doing that for a long, long time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| But it's sort of they've gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| They were used, for example, for, like, the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| at my building at Riverview Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| the garage at the First Tennessee Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| And for those of you, again, like, looking at David| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| because he's got the same white hair I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| the butcher years, they used TIFs widely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| back in that period of time to help with some of their projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| So they sort of faded away, and then I saw Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| doing a lot of downtown redevelopment TIFs for their projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| and I said, you know what, this could translate well to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| So I went back to KCDC, met with Alvin Nance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| who was our executive director at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| and started talking to the folks at the city and Bill Lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| who was our chairman of our redevelopment authority at KCDC at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| just sort of fortuitous that he ended up being here at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| We said, you know what, our downtown is dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| So we started working on projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| and realized TIFs would be a pretty good tool to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| And with this body's support, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| our downtown is much different than it was 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| and TIFs have been a huge, huge part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| And I'll talk a little bit more about the urban redevelopment TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| but that's sort of the history of both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| So how do you do a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Well, you first have to do a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| IDBs, it's called an economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| That's what Todd is bringing to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| I assume it was on your agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Is that right, Todd, or was it last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Yeah, and so you have to do an economic impact plan if you're suing IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| If it's suing a housing redevelopment authority like KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| it's called a redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| But in both cases, we have to hold a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| It's held by the IDB or by KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| and they report to you all if there's any real concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| and then it's presented to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Unlike a pilot, you cannot capture the county's increment without your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| There's no end run around you all as there is with a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| And so to get the city to contribute theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| they have to have city approval and they have to have your all's approval to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| to get the county's increment for the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| So it's a more time-consuming process that you have to go to both governing bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| And once the TIF is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| then we actually then spend the time doing the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| to make sure the developer is going to do what he or she says they're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| in terms of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| And the documentation can be fairly lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| There's a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| where there's commitments to actually build what they say they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| and that's often where we're involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| or there's a couple other firms here in town that do that kind of work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| And once that's been done, as I was describing before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| as the taxes come in, they are allocated either to the IDB or KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| to help pay debt service on debt issued by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| And they're not liable for it except for these incremental tax payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| So if KCDC does a note to a bank, a TIF note as we call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| tax increment financing note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| it's payable from those incremental tax revenues but no other revenues of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| It's not a general obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| The same thing is true of the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| And the county has absolutely no obligation to pay a TIF note whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| Your obligation is solely limited to divvying up the money and sending it their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| and that's where your obligation ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| But it begins right here whether you have the opportunity to approve it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| And if you don't approve it, then that allocation will never occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| I did a little TIF example for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| It's very, very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| But, again, I know many of you already understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| but if we have a parcel downtown, for example, that's paying $10,000 in taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| and they renovate the building, which is like falling down or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| and it jumps to $110,000, you have a $100,000 increment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| So the portion of your tax rate that's used for debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| and I got this number from Chris just today, is 20.28%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| So in this little simple example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| you immediately will start getting $20,280 that fiscal year after the building's completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| So it's not like you get nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| You get 20% of the increment immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| And then the difference, that $79,000, is allocated to KCDC or the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| depending on who did the TIF, to pay debt service on the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| So that's very simple math, but that's how these deals really work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| And that can go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| You change the tax rate, equalization, it's not like a fixed payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| and so it can go up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| And my next little slide is sort of what, Randy, you were asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| Which one's better for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Well, a PILOT's easier to administer because you put it in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| and Ed doesn't have to do the annual divvying up of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| Todd's over there telling me that PILOTs are still a pain in the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| And he's right, but I'm speaking for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| because he does have to do some annual compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| But generally a PILOT is an easier thing to administer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| But a TIF gives you immediately tax growth on the debt service part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| as I just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| And it also, the developer has more skin in the game usually with a PILOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| because they're usually forced to guarantee the payment of the TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| out of their own pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| So as you might guess, if they're personally guaranteeing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| we've probably done 30 TIFs in downtown Knoxville, maybe more now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| Two have defaulted in that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| One, CityView, which went into bankruptcy shortly after it got finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| and now it's a beautiful project and they're slowly leasing and selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| And then the other one is the Commerce Building over in the 100 block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| where the developer went back to California in the middle of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| Not a good idea, by the way, if you ever want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Go into California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| No, I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Those are the only two that we've really had a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| The other ones, if there's a shortfall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| the developer had to make up the shortfall and they were there and they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| And in both those cases, it didn't cost the county or the city a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| The defaults were purely on the banks and developers and their guarantees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| and that's how these TIFs should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| So which one of these is better for the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Well, again, a PILOT is a little bit easier to administer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| but if you're a developer and you need upfront money for your project to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| you're not going to get any upfront money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| You have nothing to borrow against with tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| With a TIF, you have an incremental revenue stream that you can borrow against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| and you can go to the bank and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| the county and city have agreed to give me the incremental taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| which based on our expert valuations should be at least this $50,000, $100,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| so please lend me money against that income stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| And they will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| They will lend money on top of their normal construction loan to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| Often this is 10% to 20% of the cost of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| This is a big chunk of the equity on a project that otherwise might not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| And so that's why a developer often needs a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| particularly on a downtown project where the numbers are not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| And then I know Randy and I, again, I'm sorry, Randy, to call you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| He and I have talked a lot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Next slide is how do you know that it's just not a greedy developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| that's got his hand out wanting incentive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| You know, I mean, if I'm a developer, I'm going to ask, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| I mean, what harm does it do to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| And I know over the years, again, somewhat Randy asking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| but other of you all have said we need to do a good job making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| that we're just not randomly approving TIFs that are not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| The first thing I would tell you is, and I'm sure Bill has told you this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| you know, a lot of these TIFs, he quashes for the downtown stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| before they even come to you all that they just don't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| But the ones that do come out of his office and are recommended to KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| or sometimes the IDB are ones that the city has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| a preliminary determination that they make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| So since there's maybe, what, two years ago or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| Prior Brown was the first one, which unfortunately has ended up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| in some litigation and stuff and hasn't moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| But we, the city, hearing your all's concerns, said, Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| are you aware of anyone that does analyses of financial statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| just to really see whether they need this TIF for, say, 10 years versus 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| and whether it's even needed at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| And so we started hiring a third-party consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| We're making the developers pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| When I say we, I'm helping KCDC, in my role as helping KCDC on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| do a study whether they really need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| What we found is they usually do, but we generally have cut back on how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| They may ask for a 15-year, and once we've run the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| it may only need to be 11 years or things like, you know, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| And so it was really due to you all initiating that concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| that we moved forward with that whole process, and it's really been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| In fact, the city liked it so much that they've adopted it for pilots as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| And so somebody comes to the city and asks for tax abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| and they do the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| They say, do they really need this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| They make them show them their pro formas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| and they really spend some time using this third-party consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| digging into the numbers and determining whether they're really needed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| And that really was due to you all protecting the public fisc,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| and it's turned into what we think is a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| But it really highlights one thing, though, is that, as I mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| the city can approve pilots for apartment buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| without coming to you all and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| And so TIFs, as I mentioned, are largely due for condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| I think most of us would say having some ownership of building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| having true homeowners downtown in condos is generally a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| People have more of a stake when they own their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| And so TIFs, I think you're going to continue to see them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| because I do think there will continue to be condo projects like Regas Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| Right now there's a lot of absorption in the market with Regas out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| and other condo projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| so I think they'll be a little bit slower in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| But you're likely to continue to see some requests for TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| largely due to condo projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| because they call out for TIFs generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2632)|
| 0:44:00| Just some general thoughts on urbanization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| And I'll be the first to admit, in fact, I will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| my daughter got married in the Emporium building on Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| and my toast was to explain to people the history of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| and about Sturkey Furniture Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| and that this was originally a TIF and a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| But after a number of glasses of champagne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| they really didn't care what I talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| In fact, I ran into poor Hugh on Friday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| as we were preparing for the wedding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| and he followed me around getting a TIF tour of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| I might add, we ran into Mark downtown there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| having a dinner together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| It was Trace and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| And he mentioned that he was giving his future son-in-law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| a tour of downtown with a focus on all the deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| that they had worked on to help redevelop downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| And I asked Mark if I could join him on the tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| And we walked down Gay Street through Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| We talked about every single building downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| that he had helped put together different forms of financing to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| and the ones in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| And it was absolutely...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| Let's just put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| If Mark has time after work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| if any of you all choose to call him up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| and ask for a similar type of tour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| I would highly recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| I also will add that where Mark is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| one thing I learned during the dinner and the ice cream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| that we had together afterwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| is that Mark got his legal start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| as the manager of the Westtown Mall Baskin-Robbins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| And that was impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| Yeah, and you know where that one is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| It no longer exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| I've dipped all 31 flavors many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| But I'll be clear that I was grateful for the tour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| and it also made a lot of the things that we're talking about today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| very real when you can see the impact on downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| and see the obvious passion he has for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| and the impact that it's had on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| So thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| And I used to think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| I was really skeptical of downtown redevelopment early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| I know as a kid, obviously, we'd come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| I'm sure some of you all did as well, to Millers and J.C. Penney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| But, you know, obviously, Westtown grew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| And as Hugh mentioned, I wouldn't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| But if those of you who are in this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| I mean, every city of our size in the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| is trying to redevelop their core downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| All you hear about is Greenville, Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| And it always makes me mad at Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| We've got a better downtown than Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| I know they've got the aquarium, but ours is more compact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| and is a better walking downtown than Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| in my modest opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| But Greenville, I can't help it that they have a waterfall downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| You know, they're very proud of their waterfall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| and they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| But, I mean, that's a great role model for us in many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| But if you look at their retail base downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| there's tons, probably 60% overlap with what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| But if you look at Huntsville, Lexington, Mobile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| these are all cities that are competing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| for a lot of the same type of industry there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| And what they're selling to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| is a vibrant downtown for young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| And so I know that often the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| not you guys have been awesome for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| supporting our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| but I think all of us, and Randy, I've talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| benefit from having a vibrant downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| And it's a huge part of economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| If you talk to the guys at Regal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| the recruiting they're able to do for folks coming to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| by now being near our downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| has made a huge difference in what they're able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| And they can still be in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| So they're in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| So, you know, it's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| As a former person in real estate and a free market capitalist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| whenever I first came on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| I was quite skeptical of TIFs and pilots in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| But the longer I've served on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| the more I see how important it is to us in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| that our downtown is vibrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| and how it helps us and Todd, the Development Corp, and the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| attract major businesses to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I just want to enclose my biases because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| ultimately, always, this is your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| whether you vote in favor of one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| but I can assure you we're trying to vet them really well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| and not bring them to you unless they make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| and can show that they need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| And, you know, Randy and I have had a lot of conversations like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| will they go away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| You know, our property values are still rising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| but the cost of building in the urban core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| the extra fire code cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| particularly if you're renovating an old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| makes it really hard to do without a pilot or a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| I mean, that's just the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| That 10% to 20% difference that they can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| in the valuation of your project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| is what makes those projects accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| And then, as Bill Lines and I have talked a lot, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| it's good, I think, for our county as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| because you're seeing a lot of young folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| and family folks my age who have become empty nesters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| move downtown, which takes less of county services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| out in suburban areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| and hopefully, you know, core urban development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| is hopefully good for our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| So that's my sales pitch, but no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| I always try to shoot straight with you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| and if you ever have a question about a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| or something that's come in front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| I'm glad to try to answer it as best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| There are, you know, I think also you're going to start seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| a few requests for greenfield TIFs, you know, the IDB TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| You've got TODs, but that's very, very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| That's really driven by a public need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| for industrial recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| But, you know, the only two TIFs we've done through IDBs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| for suburban retail projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| have been South Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| where we basically connected John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| to Chapman Highway in a safer manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| That, as Todd would tell you, was why that one got approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| It was really a road project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| and like Mike Edwards likes to remind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| of that that's why that one made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| And the other big one was done years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| was North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| And if you've ever pulled off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| and I know, John, that's your area, if I remember right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| or sort of close to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| and more like view YouTube, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| So there are all those ramps and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| that if you come off that slip ramp, as they call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| that was all paid with the TIF revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| from doing North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| And, you know, that was seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| as the sort of new urbanist type development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| that we really hadn't seen in Knoxville before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| and it was sort of a let's give this a shot sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| I don't know, that would be a really interesting thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| if that sort of project came back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| I do think you'll see some for road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| like South Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| I had a couple people call me recently about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| and so I think you'll see those sort of things come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| But Todd and his team have policies for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| but ultimately the actual TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| would need to be approved by you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| And I thought you, I'm going to close by just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| because I love to joke, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| but, you know, I do get to go all over the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| and do these deals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| and so Memphis is always just fascinating to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| I mean, pilots, if you say pilot in Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| somebody's going to take a stick to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| because basically they piloted their entire downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| They have an IDB that they call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| the Memphis Center City Revenue Finance Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| I figured if they had a long enough name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| nobody would ever say it, but it's a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| And so they do pilots for just downtown Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| and almost every building in downtown Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| that was ever renovated or got put under a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| And you can imagine Shelby County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| eventually got pretty frustrated with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| and they fought and fought and fought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| and eventually have somewhat come to a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| But we're light years ahead of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| in using TIFs and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| I mean, they have done three TIFs since they've done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| and I've gotten to work on two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| One's for Graceland, which is one of the funnest deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| If you haven't been to Graceland since it's been renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| go see Elvis. He's still alive down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| And a big TIF was done to help pay for a lot of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| But it's really interesting, very controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| and we as a community have worked so much better together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| than they have over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| and to our overall, I think, benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| And then Nashville is really weird| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| in that because they're a metro government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| there's no city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Every TIF and every pilot goes to the same entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| What, a 40-something-member city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| which is insane, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| I mean, I don't know how you all feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| but I'm sure that that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| I'd love to watch one of their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| I don't see how they get anything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Bless you, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| But what's interesting there, and Ben used to work at MDHA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| before he came to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| and so if you ever get a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| I think you would enjoy talking with him about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| They basically have abdicated their TIF authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| over to their housing authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| They create these huge TIF districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| and then say, go out, do good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| borrow no more than $200 million or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| And so, you know, they basically don't have TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| We bring almost every redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Not almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| We bring all the redevelopment TIFs to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| to get you all to sign off on them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| That is not true in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| They create these huge districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| and everything from the Omni there to the West End| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| to there's a $40-something-million TIF on the Omni,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| in downtown Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Most of their projects are TIF-driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| because they only have one entity they have to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| They do some pilots, but they're mostly TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| And their big dispute has not been the use of TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| It was that MDHA, when a deal would get paid off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| they would just keep the TIF revenues coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| So they would get the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| and they would just use it for future projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| And they built up a, as some people called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| not Ben had nothing to do with it all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| is the comptroller called it a slush fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| and they really got sort of crossways with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| and it took them a long time while to straighten that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| And then Chattanooga's been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| I love watching Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| because they're so much like us in many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| but they're so different from us in many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| because a lot of what they've done downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| was built by individual wealth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| because they've had folks like our friend Bob Corker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| but also folks, you know, like the Probascos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| and things like that who put tons of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| into downtown private money into downtown redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| And their incentives have almost all been for apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| and they've almost been pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| They've done essentially no TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| They have very few condos as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| that have been incentivized to develop downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| and most of those really nice apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| you see in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| And it's become a huge political issue down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| There's a lady that's made her life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| sort of trying to make pilots better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| in Chattanooga and Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| and she's sort of made it a statewide effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| and I'm going to close with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| and answer any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| where I went to Tasser, which is, as you all may know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| is essentially the Intergovernmental Relations Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| with the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| and she was testifying, and I don't know her well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| and she didn't even know I was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| but she said the absolute best role model in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| was Knox County because of what we were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| with third-party review and bringing every TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| to you guys to review and being as transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| as we try to be with these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| And I was like, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| because if the biggest critic in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| is going to say you're doing it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| that's a pretty good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| So anyway, I'd love to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| any specific projects you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| or answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| If that brings up the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| how does Todd or Mr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| how do you all vet these TIFs or pilots before we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| you say some of them need to get out the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| What's the process of doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| Well, the city ones will go through Bill's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| Bill, do you want to talk about what you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| to give a kibosh on some of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Just give me an idea of what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Appreciate your having me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Bill Lyons, city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Yeah, we have an office of redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| and we have an online application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| and so people will, if they're interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| we ask them to fill out what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| provide us basic information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| and as a first cut, we'll look at it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| we have two tests, a but-for test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| and that is would it happen but for the TIF and the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| which leads to the third-party review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| and the second is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| is it really worth our getting into it anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| I mean, maybe if this project doesn't happen, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Something will happen later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| and so what we do is vet it internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| We discuss what is the project, and we come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| and at that point, we often say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| we just can't support that for a variety of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| and we generally discourage them from applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| and going through because, as Mark said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| they have to go through the third-party review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| and that costs them about $10,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| and we don't want them not doing that if we can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| So we take ours, then once we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| we decide to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| We go to the developer and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| we need a third-party review to ensure that these numbers stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| because we don't have any more interest than you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| in not getting taxes that are really owed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| and having anybody unreasonably benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| from something that they shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| So we go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| Then we get with Mark and Ben and Todd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| and make sure we have the third-party review handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| We get that back, and then we'll sometimes alter their request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| cut it back some, and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| we don't think this merits what you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| It would be smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| We negotiate with them, and then we take them to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| and for TIFs to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| as you've seen, when we've brought them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| So we have had a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| We've turned down that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| we got a little bit of hard feelings here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| We've had one that we turned down that, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| later something happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| So that sort of validated our turning it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| Now, I will say what happened is a lot smaller scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| and won't produce the tax revenues for all of us later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| but we still think that was the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| But we first, I guess to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| we have an application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| and we consider it internally, and if we think we can recommend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| we put it through the review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| and then we take it to council and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| Mr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| I think that's part of the perception that we face on the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| commission is people perceive that we never turn any of these down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| And I don't think they see the behind-the-scenes process they go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| where they're vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| The bad ones don't get to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| We've discussed this at length, and there is that perception there often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| But, again, I think the answer is we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| and I think we do stand out among the big four cities in the vetting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| the third-party review, and the other things that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| and we do discourage a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| And we've tried to make that clear to folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| but it is a perception that is there occasionally for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| After your third process, vetting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| at what point do you do the public hearings and the context of when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| comes to the public and the length of time for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| Because I can see our process in terms of the public component of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| needs lots of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| And where the length of time for some of these projects impact the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| development long-term of the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| We take those to the relevant board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| and the KCDC announces a public hearing on the TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| and we talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| And we've had some of them reasonably that have gotten a lot of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| A lot of them have had no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| But that's done at that KCV level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| and we take DC level before we take it any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| I would say we did one jointly on University Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| We had quite a lot of discussion on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| when we had the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| Others, especially downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| virtually everybody around downtown likes these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| We've gotten very little opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| I think the most of it is explaining how the process works more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Ms. Gooding, sort of the gory details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| you would, once the third-party review is finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| if the city recommends moving forward based on that third-party review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| you have a three-week notice before a public hearing from KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| which is published in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| It's given to the property owners in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| And I'm sure Ben would be glad to make sure you get a copy of any of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| all that would be within your jurisdiction as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| Sorry, Ben, I just volunteered you for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| You gave me a big thumbs up on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| So it's a good notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| It's a two-week notice requirement for IDB TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| And, Mr. Dead, going to your question as to Todd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| if someone wants to do, like, a road improvement project in, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| suburban Knox County, and they say, look, I need a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| this is on your project list to do in four years, but I can't wait four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| I need this done now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| They have a lengthy application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| If I run through Brenda, who's sitting right here, if you don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| and Ray spends a lot of time on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| We haven't had many lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| I can't think we've had one now for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Is that right, Todd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Yeah, the two that I discussed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Southcove paid off really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| It really worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| I mean, financially it was a really good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| But if we have any that come, they'll go to Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| His vetting is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| It's not so much but for, although he may interject that more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| it's more an engineering review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| So a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| One of them is just what Mark said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Essentially if it's a public infrastructure work that needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| how important is it to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| So we generally will bring the application to county commission first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| and say is this something that you all support and want us to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| with before we spend all the time and effort to really do the vetting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| and to make sure that everything's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| The application has to make sure that it's filled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| and then there's an application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| And most of the application fee is used for an engineering evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| Why would you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| All right, well, so you've got a large development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| includes a lot of grading, some pad work, parking lots, road construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| utilities all going in by the same contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| Well, you know, the contractor doesn't care where they put the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| as long as they get paid, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| But we do care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| We want to make sure that the amount that's being stated that is for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| infrastructure which would be appropriate for the TIF is actually in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| with that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| So we do a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| And we have used some third party that was an outfit out of Chicago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| that had a Nashville office that we've used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| But it's been quite a while on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| And it's really pretty stringent, particularly on a retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| I mean, the percent that you can use, you don't have to take out the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| service and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| So it's not something you passively would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| We're going to come to county commission first to make sure there's political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| support for the public infrastructure that needs to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| And then we'll do the legwork to make sure that the numbers that they state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| are correct and they're accurately being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| And then the pilots, as he said, you know, there's a county IDB has a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| process that they go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Simply, you know, it's number of jobs, wage rates, capital investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| looks at any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| And there have been some that have fallen outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| They all come to county commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| And we also always do an economic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| We've got a third party that does that to determine what the return is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| the taxes foregone for that period of time was the actual tax impact through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| sales tax and other property taxes that it generates directly and indirectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| Chris, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| On Mark's handout of a simple TIF example, page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3797)|
| 1:03:28| In this example, the taxes on the property before the plan was approved were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| How much of that $10,000 went to debt service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| $2,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| So the original 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| The original 10 would be the 20.28%, so you have $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| So after the project's over, we're now applying $20,280 to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| How do we make up that general fund $8,000 that we lost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| No, they still pay the base taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| You still get the 10, so you get the 8 for the general fund plus the 2 for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Old law said that you froze the assessment, not the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3848)|
| 1:04:19| So what would happen due to equalization, you would end up with phantom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| TIF revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| It happened in Johnson City where they called me one day and said that their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| local redevelopment authority was asking for $300,000 due to equalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| even though there was no redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| And just the math worked wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| So we had to go to the legislature and rewrite the redevelopment authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| TIF statute so that the Johnson cities of the world never happened again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| So it was really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| Now you have your taxes frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| So if you have a $10,000 tax bill right now, it will never go below there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| unless you guys decide to eliminate property taxes totally in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| and I'm counting on that in the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| And I just wanted to clarify a comment to Mark earlier, my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| and what it was is I was remembering from our April meeting where the TIF limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| was 15 years and then we went to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| And so when I saw year 20, I was thinking five more, so that's 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| So that's where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| But it was only 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| That's an excellent, and you were right on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| Again, I'm sorry I'm taking your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| but obviously there's a lot of it in the newspaper about Easttown lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| or Knoxville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| And one project that we spent, I think I spent seven years working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| was the mall in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| As you all know, that mall just totally died, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| And worst time in the world, the recession hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| And, I mean, for a while it was a walking track for senior people like me, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| but it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| Every store closed in the interior of the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| The roof started leaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| What had been a $40 million assessment went down to $6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| and then went down to almost nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| And so it was a real disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| And so we first tried pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| They were trying to do a big redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| And we eventually have done a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| The county committed to 20 years on their TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| and the city went all the way to 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| and went to the comptroller and got approval to TIF their taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| even longer than the county because the number wouldn't work at 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| And they felt like commission had done their share at 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| and they even went back further to help the banks make the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| So it was about an $11 million TIF on that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| that basically tore down the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| I don't know if any of you all have been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| but you can basically park where the mall used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| and the Belk is a standalone store now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| The JCPenney still looks like it used to be part of a mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| but it's a standalone store now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| And they have some really nice shops there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| and they want that to be their town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| because Oak Ridge historically, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| really didn't have a downtown other than maybe Jackson Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| But it's a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| Similar story, too, for those of you who are familiar with Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| is Bellevue Mall was a mall much like Knoxville Center Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| that was in far west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| It's at the Bellevue exit, surprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| as you're going toward Memphis, and the mall just totally died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| And so they totally went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| That one was about a $20 million or $30 million TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| to pay for the redevelopment of that mall through an IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| not through a redevelopment authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| and they are redeveloping that entire site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| as a mixed housing retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| They have a library there, development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| because malls just in many ways have become dinosaurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| I mean, I'm not suggesting West Elm Mall is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| Please don't tear down my Baskin-Robbins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| or what used to be my Baskin-Robbins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| They actually covered that entrance up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| And if you've never worn a pink Baskin-Robbins shirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| you really have never lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| But Bellevue is a really interesting thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| and it was a very interesting TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| It was one of the harder ones that we worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| It was one of the bigger ones that had been done in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| And so we're seeing a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| We're seeing a lot of incentives at mall generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| Like in Maryville for Foothills Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| we did tax abatement for them to do a theater there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| because they wanted to create foot traffic in their mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| because theaters, as you well know, drive through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| That's why it's really good for West Elm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| for Eagles investing and turning that into a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| I don't know what they call it, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Cinnabar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Cinnabar, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| You can get drunk while you watch your movie, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| But the, uh...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| But anyway, theater's very good for a mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| So it's going to be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| But those are a couple of examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| and as I read about Knoxville Center in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| it always makes me interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Obviously, I'm hoping that it works out well for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| but it's going to be a challenging redevelopment site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| Any other projects y'all want to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| else I can tell y'all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| We have Councilwoman Welch here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| If you have any questions, Stephanie, feel free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| Have you got any great ideas what we can do at Knoxville Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Do I have great ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Yeah, can we get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| You know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| I mean, I don't know well the people that bought the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| so I don't know what their motivation is to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| The challenging part of Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| was that they had a developer who knew they had something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| that was essential to the community to redevelop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| and they were basically holding the community hostage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| and knew that I've got the card, and you're willing to pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| and I'm not going to be reasonable in negotiating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| And so it was really difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| And I'm not suggesting that's how it is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| It just cries out to me for a total redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| and it's going to be a major, major undertaking to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| and I can't imagine that it will happen without a lot of incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| But you guys have got to feel very comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| who you're incentivizing and what the project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| There are a few locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| I know you guys know this better than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| that a mall is such a great piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| no matter that it's been graded and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| So I think it has unlimited potential for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| and it's such a centrally located area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| but it really cries out for a master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| and a very thoughtful redevelopment process to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| And so I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| I mean, the retail market is crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| I mean, I'm working on a small community right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| where they're trying to get a tractor supply to come there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| because everyone in that little community is going to the next county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| to shop at their tractor supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Well, a tractor supply is a couple hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| of sales tax revenues to a small community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| They're going to pay for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| Probably the best TIF that I ever did was for the Lowe's in Newport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| at least best for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| because every refrigerator, every lawnmower in Newport and Cocke County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| and that whole part of East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| they were going to Morristown or here to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Now, you know, with a $2 million TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| they paid that back in sales tax almost overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| And I think there could be a win-win situation for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| but it's going to be a real challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| unless you have a very motivated seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Obviously, you know, and again, all I'm reading is when the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| with the taxes being unpaid and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| you know, there seems to be some interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| in maybe something needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| but, you know, I don't have a magic bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| But I would encourage you to look at Bellevue Mall, the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| and read about it on the paper, as well as the Oak Ridge Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| And if any of you have not been there, I'd encourage you to stop by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| It can really show sort of what a redevelopment can look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| I have one more interesting project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| and that is the city had indicated the police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| to be at Knoxville College on the backside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Could you speak to that project, if you know any information on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| What will occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Yes, and I'll be the first to admit, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| other than just friendly conversations with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| I mean, they're clearly, I mean, it's all been in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| about possible relocation of the fire and the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| and so whether that's the best location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| I just know, I mean, I've been up with Chris up at Rule High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| I'm talking about just the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Yeah, the area, just such a wonderful area for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| When Chris and I went to Rule, the old Rule High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| the views up there are just absolutely stupendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| And I've spent a lot of time over the years at KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| and I'm sorry I'm pointing to Ben,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| where some of our housing locations there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| are just absolutely some of the best, beautiful locations in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| But it is certainly challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Like, going up to Rule, as you probably know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| the roads aren't the best access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| It would probably need some improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| It really, I think, would take a collaborative city-county effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| and I'm sure Bill would tell you there would want to be a good teamwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| I just think there's, you know, Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| My parents, you know, I know I have a weird last name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| but I really did grow up here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| My dad was a chemistry professor at UT, and my mom is also a chemist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| and she actually went over to Knoxville College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| to try to help them with some of the chemicals and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| There's some real challenges, you know, in trying to redevelop that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| as I'm sure you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| And so I think it's got great potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| I just don't know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| I don't know enough about the financing that's on the college right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| I do a lot of nonprofit college financing, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| I'm really curious just because of my own thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| but I don't have really any personal, intimate knowledge of it sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| But I do think that whole area, those ridges going that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| with those wonderful views long-term cry out for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| And I think some other areas like Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| there's some buildings there that I just love those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| Vestal, I mean, I know that sounds silly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| but I just think there's a couple of buildings in Vestal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| that cry out for redevelopment long-term that I just think that we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| When we think of core urban redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| we need to not forget some of the historic little neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| that have made Knox County kind of a cool place historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| So, of course, again, sorry to get off my soapbox a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| but I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| Could you answer one more question about the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| because that's the district I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| closer to where Knoxville Zoo, Chihaui,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| because that encompasses Burlington right off of that exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| As we look at potential growth there, could you respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| Yeah, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| I mean, that one I think I can respond hopefully fairly well to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| is that certainly we went with Fish and Electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| We're moving east with TIFFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| and I think we will see that pilots from the city standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| I'm sure Bill would agree with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| our current redevelopment plan goes that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| I think the main areas that you will see requests for TIFFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| there are a few remaining projects downtown that might be piloted or TIFFed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| But I think what you'll largely see is going out toward the Magnolia Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| some of the warehouses in that area, and also up I-275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| There are some wonderful buildings up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| where the old Dempster-Dempster location was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| I think that's your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| There are just some great buildings there that cry out for redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| and I think we'll see more and more requests for incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| And again, you all ultimately will have to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| if that's something you all want to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| And obviously if they can do it on their own, great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| but there are certainly some buildings of such magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| that will just not work without a little bit of a hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| I just want to say thank you. I really enjoyed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| Any time you all want to hear about a specific deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| or if you ever want me to come and go over a bond resolution and get a good nap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618ChairmansBriefing?start=4528)|
