| 2:27:09| That's $100,000, and the more you play, the more you wear it out, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8829)|
| 2:27:15| I do think that this would be up to the school system because currently it is a principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| by principal, school by school decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| So we can ask them to give some feedback on that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| And I concur with Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| I like the idea of those, you know, their properties being open to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8847)|
| 2:27:34| Sometimes they just sit empty during periods, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| All right, then we get into page 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| The only thing I could see from Knox County Schools pushback would be from the high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8865)|
| 2:27:52| where you have booster clubs that have invested heavily in maintaining soccer fields or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| football programs, practice fields, to allow the public to go on those and the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8878)|
| 2:28:04| of those being damaged by the public would not go over very well, particularly if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8884)|
| 2:28:10| booster clubs are spending their resources to maintain those facilities for those specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8890)|
| 2:28:18| sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8898)|
| 2:28:19| So, and you've got the risk management factor too, if someone gets hurt messing around with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8899)|
| 2:28:27| the sleds or something from the football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| Yeah, I will add to that also just from prior experience that, you know, it would be nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8910)|
| 2:28:40| to think that we could leave all these facilities open and people would come in and do the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8920)|
| 2:28:45| thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| And unfortunately, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| And we had some pretty serious situations with playgrounds that we tried to keep open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8929)|
| 2:28:56| that were used after hours for not very good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8936)|
| 2:29:01| And then, I mean, they would just be trashed the next morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| You know, it makes so much sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| And I agree, it would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| But the school does maintain that liability as far as having to come in and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8950)|
| 2:29:18| So, I do appreciate, I don't like it, but I do appreciate why those have to be restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8958)|
| 2:29:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| Thank you all for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| We get into page 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8970)|
| 2:29:31| This is additional implementation actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| And I do think this is where we want to strengthen the criteria for amending the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8975)|
| 2:29:40| The goal of updating the comp plan was to identify where we can and should grow while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8980)|
| 2:29:45| preserving our rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| And we have put a lot of effort in doing just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| So, amending the plan going forward should be a rarity and not a norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8991)|
| 2:29:57| So, I asked for suggestions to strengthen the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| And the county was kind enough to take that question back to the consultants who said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9000)|
| 2:30:07| that they, you know, they proposed criteria for a plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| The proposed criteria for a plan update was strong comparatively with other clients that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9010)|
| 2:30:16| they had worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| They did recommend to change the introductory text to if an obvious or significant error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9018)|
| 2:30:24| or omission in the plan, or if two or more criteria apply, it may be appropriate to update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9024)|
| 2:30:31| the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| Furthermore, it was recommended by the consultant and the staff to planning commission to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| the frequency of hearings for plan updates annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| So, you have an error in your copy in your handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9039)|
| 2:30:44| The staff recommended quarterly to planning commission and planning commission passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| So, I just want to bring this up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9051)|
| 2:30:54| Again, I reached out to several different like planning commissioners, planning professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9054)|
| 2:31:00| advocacy groups as well for their insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| And what you have is what they suggested in my attempt to kind of put it all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9063)|
| 2:31:11| in a fairly simple form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| So, this is one suggestion for consideration is just replacing the criteria with the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9074)|
| 2:31:22| And you can kind of read through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9082)|
| 2:31:26| Another option is consider keeping the criteria for the plan update as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9086)|
| 2:31:32| But change back to the original language suggested by the consultant and the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| to read if an obvious or significant error or omission in the plan, or if two or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9097)|
| 2:31:43| criteria apply, it may be appropriate to update the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| And in coordination with that, amend the frequency of plan amendments to possibly semi-annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9106)|
| 2:31:55| or annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| So, those are things to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9117)|
| 2:32:03| I don't know if you want to discuss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| If you want to look at them, I tried to include the current amendment criteria for the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9125)|
| 2:32:16| under number one, whether one of the following situations exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| The blue language is what is in the criteria currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9141)|
| 2:32:27| And I did change where it says, I think zonings to such as adjacent place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9147)|
| 2:32:37| And the change of a zoning or land use in the vicinity or general area of a proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9157)|
| 2:32:41| property really shouldn't be considered a change of condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| Adjacent land uses could be, but this would protect the integrity of the plan and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9165)|
| 2:32:50| place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| And then in D, the proposed changes support the policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| I just wanted to point out that the policies are referencing those 23 policies on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9175)|
| 2:33:01| 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9181)|
| 2:33:02| And so, this gives staff and decision-making bodies the ability to refer to those policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9182)|
| 2:33:09| and include them in their justification for support or denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9189)|
| 2:33:15| And then you just get into whether the land use amendment request is compatible with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| surrounding future land uses as identified in the flume, whether the land use amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| request can be served by existing transportation facilities and other infrastructure and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| such as school water and sewer, whether the land use amendment request negatively impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| environmentally sensitive areas identified by planning, whether the plan amendment request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9213)|
| 2:33:38| respects clear and sharp distinctions made in the plan between suburban and rural place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| types and therefore will protect rural character, whether the land use amendment request is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9222)|
| 2:33:47| not conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| Staff and I, we talked about this one and deleting it and including the original text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9229)|
| 2:33:55| back up in 1D because this also addresses the 23 policies on page 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9235)|
| 2:34:02| And then the question for Director Snowden in this criteria, is it appropriate to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9242)|
| 2:34:08| any more specifics regarding roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9248)|
| 2:34:12| So, that's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9252)|
| 2:34:17| And those, that criteria, I just, we really try to just go into more specifics where anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9257)|
| 2:34:27| can pick up the comprehensive plan and understand the criteria to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9267)|
| 2:34:37| So, I'm sure that you all have comments, discussion, thoughts, feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| I would like to hear planning committee staff thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9283)|
| 2:34:53| What I think I hear you asking for is to increase the number of criteria that need to be met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9293)|
| 2:35:02| but then you're also adding a few criteria to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| You know, it's really up to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| I mean, I'm just kind of throwing this out there and saying, these are things that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9310)|
| 2:35:15| feel would be good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| You can like one or all or pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9317)|
| 2:35:22| You might like the idea of including some of them in the original text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9322)|
| 2:35:32| It's kind of, I'm just throwing it out there for discussion, for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9332)|
| 2:35:38| You may come back and say, I don't like any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| I want to stick to the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| That is up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| I just kept hearing over and over and over again, I need the plan amendment criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9346)|
| 2:35:53| to have more teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9353)|
| 2:35:57| And so, this was my attempt to take all of the perspectives, all of the considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9357)|
| 2:36:02| the dozens of suggestions that were submitted to me and do the very best that I can to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9362)|
| 2:36:10| of put them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9370)|
| 2:36:14| So again, it's for this body's consideration to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| Again, we don't, you can discuss it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| I mean, you know, I just don't, I don't know, I don't know what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9385)|
| 2:36:33| I just really want to protect the integrity of the place types and this plan going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9393)|
| 2:36:39| And I know that it may feel a little restrictive, but I have seen where not putting teeth in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9399)|
| 2:36:48| things have gotten us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9408)|
| 2:36:51| Because I live in the community of that is the perfect example of what not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9411)|
| 2:36:56| So, I just ask that you consider these, take them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| Again, you know, provide suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| I've tried to give you a couple of different just ways to look at it and think about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9426)|
| 2:37:11| and consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9431)|
| 2:37:15| So, that is that portion of the discussion item on page 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9435)|
| 2:37:22| So, I do have another discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| Well, hold on because I do understand that it's this body's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9445)|
| 2:37:31| However, I do want to hear what planning has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| Ms. Benedict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| I think I would like to speak to the process of this and then let Amy get into the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| of the actual amendment that Commissioner Frazier has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9462)|
| 2:37:46| Commissioner Frazier did come to us and request some plan amendment criteria and more teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9466)|
| 2:37:52| We reached out to the consultant that we hired multiple times and what you have before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9472)|
| 2:37:57| you is what they gave us as best practice that they've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9477)|
| 2:38:00| Also, we would, we amend our, we have plan amendments monthly now and we put forth a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9480)|
| 2:38:07| quarterly as a compromise moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9487)|
| 2:38:12| But we also will support the requiring to plan amendment or two criteria to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9492)|
| 2:38:20| And then Amy can speak to the details of what Commissioner Frazier has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9500)|
| 2:38:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9506)|
| 2:38:29| Thanks, Mandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| Let's see, where should I start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| Well, I guess first off, you know, the addition of this new criteria, you know, I'll defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9513)|
| 2:38:42| to Law Director Moyers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| But in my opinion, I believe that this would be a substantial amendment and that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| need to go back to Planning Commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9530)|
| 2:38:54| Planning Commission considers these, they use this, we, staff use this in our analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9534)|
| 2:38:59| but Planning Commissioners as well will use this in their analysis when they're considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9542)|
| 2:39:03| So I do think it's really important that we properly vet it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| But again, I'll defer to Law Director Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| Let me, which part are you speaking to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| The criteria for plan update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9554)|
| 2:39:15| So what's, let me see which, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9555)|
| 2:39:20| Page six and seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9560)|
| 2:39:21| Yeah, I was looking for what page it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| I got a couple different versions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| So page, starting on page, actually starting on page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9564)|
| 2:39:33| So two, three, four, five, six, and possibly seven, if those were added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9573)|
| 2:39:42| Although, you know, as Commissioner Fraser said, item number six, it's already in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9582)|
| 2:39:47| criteria that was recommended for approval by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| It's just been reworded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9592)|
| 2:39:53| And staff would support the original language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9593)|
| 2:40:04| You mean six or all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| All.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| Could you, Commissioner Schoonmaker, could you share your side conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9607)|
| 2:40:16| Well, the comment was directed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| Your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| I was just saying that it just doesn't seem like those are substantial changes for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9622)|
| 2:40:27| to go all the way back to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| But again, I'm not the legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9629)|
| 2:40:33| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| Before you address that, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| I have overlooked you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9636)|
| 2:40:40| Are you wanting to speak to this specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9640)|
| 2:40:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| I really just had a question for Commissioner Fraser, and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9646)|
| 2:40:51| specifically about items two through six on page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9651)|
| 2:40:55| And are these, these are, I just wanted, it's more clarification that these are additional to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9655)|
| 2:41:02| the current criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| Yeah, so the way that it's written is you could replace the current criteria or that blue column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9664)|
| 2:41:10| right, with the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| Everything that's listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| With the suggested changes from staff about item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9675)|
| 2:41:20| Or you could, another consideration is keep everything as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9680)|
| 2:41:27| but go back to the original language that was suggested by the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9687)|
| 2:41:32| Staff to read if an obvious or significant error, but that two criterias apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9692)|
| 2:41:37| And then also consider updating the frequency of plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9697)|
| 2:41:45| Currently now it's quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| So again, these are all just considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| I just, again, tried to put it all out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9712)|
| 2:41:56| Put it all out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9716)|
| 2:41:57| Okay, so Director Brooks, what you're telling me is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9717)|
| 2:42:02| and this is the first time I've, tonight's the first time I've seen these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| that two, three, four, and five, and perhaps six were things that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| never considered by the Planning Commission when they took this up or by staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9728)|
| 2:42:19| They weren't considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| No, they were not considered, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| So these would all be additions to the current criteria for plan updates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9744)|
| 2:42:29| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9749)|
| 2:42:32| That would be, I would have to say that would be pretty close to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| that would have to go back, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| If it hasn't, if these are new, have not been considered by the staff or the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9757)|
| 2:42:43| you know, without saying whether good or bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| this is the sort of thing that probably would need to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9767)|
| 2:42:50| And I would also, if the Commission was interested in pursuing these additional criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9770)|
| 2:42:57| I think that we would need some additional guidance provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9777)|
| 2:43:02| from the policy level on items four and five, as relates to negative impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9782)|
| 2:43:08| You know, whether the Land Use Amendment request negatively impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9788)|
| 2:43:11| environmental sensitive areas, how do you define negatively impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| What is the scale of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| The scale of that, and then number five would be the same concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9798)|
| 2:43:21| respects clear and sharp distinctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| Again, we need additional guidance and just clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9803)|
| 2:43:30| on what's meant by clear and sharp distinctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9810)|
| 2:43:40| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| I'm referring to this blue section on page 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9823)|
| 2:43:53| I'm hearing the team, staff, et cetera, say that requiring two of those criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9833)|
| 2:44:00| is something you all felt was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9844)|
| 2:44:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9844)|
| 2:44:05| I would agree with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| I think the one section I have here on your page six, Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| is the annual quarterly seems more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9852)|
| 2:44:18| Imagine if you have some issue, and you have to wait a whole year to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9858)|
| 2:44:24| Maybe there's an amendment, or maybe there's an omission, or there's an error in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| and you got to literally sit there for a year as a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9868)|
| 2:44:33| I just think that's, I think quarterly makes more sense from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| We can handle the requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| So, why make people sit there for a year on their potential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9878)|
| 2:44:43| So, I would suggest keeping the language as is, amending it to two criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9883)|
| 2:44:49| and making it quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| So, that would just be my feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9891)|
| 2:44:54| And Director Brooks, you can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| That wasn't the original recommendation from the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9896)|
| 2:45:00| And we've actually looked at other areas, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9900)|
| 2:45:02| where they do only amend the plan once or twice per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9902)|
| 2:45:09| In some of your larger counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| I'm happy to speak to it, because I am the one that pushed back on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9912)|
| 2:45:16| I believe that the consultants did bring us annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| But also, we are moving from a monthly amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9920)|
| 2:45:25| And I think at least in the first five years of implementing this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9925)|
| 2:45:30| that quarterly is a fair compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| And I'll add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9933)|
| 2:45:33| The discussion at Planning Commission and at their work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| was possibly a balance of quarterly for year one and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9937)|
| 2:45:41| and then revisiting after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9941)|
| 2:45:46| And just a reminder, too, this is the mayor's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9946)|
| 2:45:52| I mean, we're just trying to be good stewards of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| But I do want to be respectful and mindful of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9955)|
| 2:46:02| This is his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| I have a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9968)|
| 2:46:11| Get away from page 72 altogether, just mentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| Just take a break for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| This is a clarifying question from a constituent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9978)|
| 2:46:22| With this comprehensive land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9982)|
| 2:46:26| transportation plan, growth policy plan, new maps, all our new work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9986)|
| 2:46:34| None of that will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| The zoning that is currently with properties today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=9996)|
| 2:46:40| will stay with those big properties and be reflected in those maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10000)|
| 2:46:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10003)|
| 2:46:44| Because remember, we had this issue before where somebody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10004)|
| 2:46:47| hey, I'm about to develop X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| And the plan, the sector plan said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| wouldn't it be great for this to be a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| But it wasn't zoned a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10013)|
| 2:46:54| It was zoned a commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10014)|
| 2:46:56| And I just want to be very clear that as your land is zoned today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| when all of this goes into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| your land will be reflected on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10022)|
| 2:47:03| It will stay that zoning and it will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10027)|
| 2:47:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| And that includes any sales or any change of ownership in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10029)|
| 2:47:16| The zoning stays with the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10036)|
| 2:47:19| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| With the original zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| Good clarifying point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| Does that say that in here somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10045)|
| 2:47:30| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10050)|
| 2:47:31| Does it say that in any of this anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10051)|
| 2:47:36| Well...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10056)|
| 2:47:39| Can we put it in there as an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| That's stated in the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| It is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10062)|
| 2:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10063)|
| 2:47:43| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10063)|
| 2:47:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| Oh, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10064)|
| 2:47:44| I want to make sure it is somewhere out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10064)|
| 2:47:47| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| Can we get rid of R.B.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| I don't want to see a container housing in my R.B. zone, which is ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10077)|
| 2:48:06| If there's some way that we could get rid of R.B. in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10086)|
| 2:48:09| let's get rid of R.B., please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| It's a great conversation for the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| To clarify, if we were to change this as written to two criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10093)|
| 2:48:36| that would or would not be enough change to have to go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| No, I think two criteria has been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10120)|
| 2:48:44| That would not need to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10124)|
| 2:48:48| I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| It's just some of these two, three, four, five, six, to the extent that they haven't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| considered by the planning commission, that would probably be a significant enough change to warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10135)|
| 2:49:04| getting their advice and recommendations before we were to adopt them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10144)|
| 2:49:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10150)|
| 2:49:15| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10157)|
| 2:49:18| I just kind of wanted to get into the queue here because I have a couple of potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10158)|
| 2:49:21| amendments to the place type map and others probably do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10161)|
| 2:49:27| One I can show you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| The other I can't show you yet because I want to meet with staff on it before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10169)|
| 2:49:33| actually decide what I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| Just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10176)|
| 2:49:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10177)|
| 2:49:37| Commissioner Frazier still has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| I appreciate that, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10183)|
| 2:49:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10189)|
| 2:49:49| I just have one more discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| I know y'all are happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10193)|
| 2:49:54| These are the place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10194)|
| 2:49:55| So the comprehensive plan is where we focus on zonings appropriate within the place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10195)|
| 2:50:00| in accordance with the growth policy plan land use designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| And the place types are where we should think about lifestyles of the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| the character of a community and supportive infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| The question to consider, in my opinion, is what do we envision this area to look and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| feel like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| For instance, when you think of and envision rural living, do you envision unified subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10216)|
| 2:50:23| and unified subdivisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| I'm referring to those subdivisions with one, the same builder, 12 or so floor plans on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10225)|
| 2:50:32| specific size lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10232)|
| 2:50:34| Or when you think of rural living, do you envision individual custom homes on various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10234)|
| 2:50:39| sized lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| So as you consider place types, I would just ask that you, you know, kind of decide, do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10241)|
| 2:50:49| you envision unified developments in the rural place types or do you want developments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10249)|
| 2:50:53| be more organic in nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10253)|
| 2:50:56| Further, you have to consider the East Tennessee topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| We have narrow and steep shoulders on our existing roads that limit the county's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10259)|
| 2:51:05| to ever increase capacity or mitigate congestion on those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10265)|
| 2:51:11| I just feel like in the place type, this is where we really have to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| You know, density within a place type can and should also be based on what the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10275)|
| 2:51:20| in that place type can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10280)|
| 2:51:22| So for far too long, I think that we've approved densities that have critically impacted our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10282)|
| 2:51:27| roadways with no option of ever improving the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10287)|
| 2:51:34| So that's just something to put out there when you're looking at place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10294)|
| 2:51:40| When you get into page 37, rural living, housing mix, I know for me and probably for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10300)|
| 2:51:47| there's been a lot of discussion regarding what zoning districts and density we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10307)|
| 2:51:52| are appropriate in the rural living place type in both the planned growth area and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10312)|
| 2:51:57| the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10317)|
| 2:51:58| The rural area, that's the clear one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| The growth policy section 4.3, it says it allows density in the rural area of the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10320)|
| 2:52:06| map up to two per acre regardless of the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10326)|
| 2:52:10| For those rural living place types in the planned growth area as proposed, planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10330)|
| 2:52:15| is partially related up to five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10335)|
| 2:52:19| So something to think about is, do we feel like PR in the rural living place type should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10339)|
| 2:52:25| possibly be omitted or if it does remain as partially related, should we restrict density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10345)|
| 2:52:32| in some way that protects the rural character?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10352)|
| 2:52:35| Again, a lot of the discussion, especially in East Knox County, the ideal vision for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10355)|
| 2:52:42| a rural living place type was one dwelling per two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10362)|
| 2:52:47| But that doesn't support the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10367)|
| 2:52:51| So others have suggested aligning the rural living place type with the density established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10371)|
| 2:52:56| in the rural area in the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10376)|
| 2:53:00| Additionally, others felt that, like I said, PR should possibly be omitted altogether in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10380)|
| 2:53:07| the rural living place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| So I really haven't landed firmly on what I think, again, that's, I would love to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10389)|
| 2:53:18| feedback, that's the rural living place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10398)|
| 2:53:24| So I don't know if you want to discuss that one or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10404)|
| 2:53:28| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| I guess I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| I thought we spent a significant amount of time with the growth policy plan designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10414)|
| 2:53:39| that rural would be, go from three units an acre to two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10419)|
| 2:53:44| That is in the growth policy map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10424)|
| 2:53:47| It's not in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| Go from three units an acre to two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10430)|
| 2:53:53| That is in the growth policy map of the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10433)|
| 2:53:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| These are the place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10439)|
| 2:54:02| Okay, but we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| You have various place types in those land use designations of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10444)|
| 2:54:12| But you're, I guess what I'm trying to, you're suggesting getting rid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10452)|
| 2:54:20| some place types so it's even less than two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10460)|
| 2:54:23| No, getting, there was, you could consider omitting, if you would turn to your matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10463)|
| 2:54:32| this might help a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10472)|
| 2:54:35| To the left, you've got all the place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10475)|
| 2:54:39| Across the top are all of our existing zoning districts or zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| So like I said earlier, you could actually use this matrix kind of as a transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10483)|
| 2:54:48| until we get the UDO completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10488)|
| 2:54:51| And you'll see that in the rural living place type, what zonings are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10491)|
| 2:54:59| Right now, there's PR, planned residential, up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10499)|
| 2:55:03| PR, planned residential, two to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10503)|
| 2:55:06| That is partially related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10506)|
| 2:55:09| And we just went over earlier what partially related meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10509)|
| 2:55:13| And these, the different, like, the square is directly related, zero, the O is partially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10513)|
| 2:55:18| related, and then others are appropriate in all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10518)|
| 2:55:23| So that's why those are highlighted yellow in the copy that I gave you to denote a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| like, what do we think is appropriate there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10528)|
| 2:55:33| You'll also see that the column of PR, planned residential zone, it read, what do we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10533)|
| 2:55:42| it read, one to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| And the orange denotes a proposed change of PR zero to two if this body decides to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10544)|
| 2:55:52| PR in the rural living place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10552)|
| 2:55:57| How can you have zero units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| Well, because you could come in at, like, 0.3 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10559)|
| 2:56:03| If you say one to two, you're eliminating anything one and below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10563)|
| 2:56:07| Doesn't that offer us less tools to work with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10567)|
| 2:56:11| I mean, I thought the whole point of PR was to give us more options to look at different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10571)|
| 2:56:20| developments and determine what was appropriate, what was between this and that and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10580)|
| 2:56:26| It seems to limit us even more and more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10586)|
| 2:56:30| But is that the point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10590)|
| 2:56:31| Is the point you're saying, in rural, you know, in rural areas, there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10591)|
| 2:56:37| rural, you're saying in rural living and rural conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10597)|
| 2:56:43| no one should ever build more than one every five acres or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10603)|
| 2:56:47| And that's where I'm asking, I think, as commissioners, you have to decide what does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10607)|
| 2:56:51| how do you envision rural living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| Do you envision it with unified subdivisions, one builder, 12 different floor plans, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10613)|
| 2:57:01| do you envision rural living to be individual, more custom homes on different size lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10621)|
| 2:57:10| That's what you really have to determine in your thought process before you kind of can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| determine what you feel is appropriate zoning in those place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10635)|
| 2:57:24| Yeah, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| And so that's why I don't think a decision, like, I don't think we can even land on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10646)|
| 2:57:31| tonight if you want to take that back and think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10651)|
| 2:57:39| I'm offering to have more discussion on Friday at 1030 at the EPW building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10659)|
| 2:57:47| I think staff has cleared their schedule for more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10667)|
| 2:57:53| I have a hard time trying to figure out, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10673)|
| 2:57:57| how this is all going to fall into place before Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| We have an agenda that's set on Thursday that comes out for the whole public to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10680)|
| 2:58:06| And usually, with every ordinance we do, or every plan we do, we get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10686)|
| 2:58:16| red line version that says, here's what it says today, and here's the proposed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10696)|
| 2:58:22| by X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10702)|
| 2:58:22| And you've done that in great detail, but there's also a lot of sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10702)|
| 2:58:28| discussion, big ambiguity of, like, we could do this, or we could do that, or we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10708)|
| 2:58:33| So is your plan to give us a Kim's red line version to consider, and then Kyle's red line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10713)|
| 2:58:41| version to consider, and Carson's red line version to consider by Thursday's agenda so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10721)|
| 2:58:46| we can have time to digest it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| Or I'm asking more of the chair, I guess, how is this going to solidify into something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10728)|
| 2:58:55| we can decide, like, A, B, C, or D on Monday with 48 hours notice for a meeting on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10735)|
| 2:59:02| that not everybody can make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10742)|
| 2:59:04| Can you help me think through that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10744)|
| 2:59:11| Well, I can address, as far as the Friday meeting, that this is something that is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10751)|
| 2:59:18| open and available if you'd like to come and discuss more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10758)|
| 2:59:23| It's just another opportunity to do it in a probably a little bit more casual environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10763)|
| 2:59:31| I hear you loud and clear, your concern about the time crunch that we're under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10771)|
| 2:59:41| You know, I might suggest that every commissioner use what I've given you as kind of a starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10781)|
| 2:59:48| point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10788)|
| 2:59:49| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10789)|
| 2:59:49| Go back and look at those sections and the page numbers if you agree or disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10789)|
| 2:59:57| If you have suggestions for different language, propose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10797)|
| 3:00:03| Director Benedict, do you have a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| Again, I guess I'm trying to say I don't want this to be, like Commissioner Ward said, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10808)|
| 3:00:13| don't want this to be a Kim plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| I want input and feedback from the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10815)|
| 3:00:19| And I've tried very hard to just give everyone kind of a starting place with considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10819)|
| 3:00:26| And you've done a great job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| I mean, clearly, this represents a time crunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10828)|
| 3:00:33| Clearly, this represents ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10833)|
| 3:00:36| And I get that and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10836)|
| 3:00:40| I think that does not, it helps, but it's still, I mean, it helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10840)|
| 3:00:48| However, Commissioners, Jay's concern about the time, the time crunch so much and so little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10848)|
| 3:00:54| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10854)|
| 3:00:55| I don't really know outside of having a special call meeting before May, whenever our regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10855)|
| 3:01:08| May meetings are to have more time to discuss and digest this might be an option that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10868)|
| 3:01:15| need to look at so we can have more time to digest this and perhaps come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10875)|
| 3:01:21| I mean, I've been taking notes and what I plan to do or what I was planning to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10881)|
| 3:01:25| next Monday just come forward with prepared motions and you can vote them up or down or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10885)|
| 3:01:32| make or amend the motion with a suggested change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10892)|
| 3:01:37| Or if you have a motion prepared for one of the topics, you make the motion and we just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10897)|
| 3:01:44| we use the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| I guess it's just, but I can't, I can't do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10906)|
| 3:01:52| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10912)|
| 3:01:53| Is there any reason, we still can have, Commissioner Moyers, we still have the option to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10913)|
| 3:02:01| actually revisit this and do an up or down in our May meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10921)|
| 3:02:05| That would be timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10925)|
| 3:02:09| I mean, without, without negating everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10931)|

| 3:02:12| It would be timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10932)|
| 3:02:13| Our May meeting is set on the 20th, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10935)|
| 3:02:16| So, some feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10936)|
| 3:02:18| So, yes, if you adopted it on the 20th of May, it would still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10938)|
| 3:02:23| Within the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10943)|

| 3:02:26| Just under the wire, but it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10946)|
| 3:02:29| I don't know how else to address your concerns, Commissioner Jay, as far as the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10949)|
| 3:02:36| I have another suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10956)|

| 3:02:49| after amendment and the stack continues from ourselves, from our commission, from our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10969)|

| 3:03:09| Could we on Monday, given that we are in the thicket of this and we know this is, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10989)|
| 3:03:19| it's going to, each of these things might take some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| Could we on Monday vote to uncouple this from the growth policy plan that we coupled it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11003)|
| 3:03:31| to, to begin with, get that timeline off our back, and then at the exact same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11011)|
| 3:03:38| set another workshop that goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11018)|
| 3:03:43| I feel like every one of these pages I could spend two hours on because this is part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11023)|
| 3:03:48| the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11028)|
| 3:03:48| Like, what do I think rural looks like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11030)|
| 3:03:50| What do you think rural looks like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11030)|
| 3:03:51| What does Carson think rural looks like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11031)|
| 3:03:52| I bet you Kyle thinks something different than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| And take a little bit more time and then set this as a special meeting, say, before our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11035)|
| 3:04:00| end of our fiscal year by June 15th or by June 30th, we will have a series of more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11040)|
| 3:04:07| I just feel like if we rush this and we try to get to a vote on Monday and it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11047)|
| 3:04:12| work or we go through, you may have 42 amendments here and 25 of them may be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11052)|
| 3:04:19| But if we rush through it and we don't get it all, then we may only vote on four of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11059)|
| 3:04:23| and we've lost an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| It's just a suggestion for the body that we might take a little pressure off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11065)|
| 3:04:28| I don't think anybody in the community that we made that pledge to would think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11068)|
| 3:04:33| are not actively working in the trenches on this and are going to punt it down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11073)|
| 3:04:38| We know we have to do this before because the state losses of this document must, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11078)|
| 3:04:43| UDO must be reflective of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| We can't not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11085)|
| 3:04:48| We can't not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| But I would really hate to screw up a deadline that is so huge because we need a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11090)|
| 3:04:56| more time digging into the minutia of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| So this is just an idea to throw out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11098)|
| 3:05:01| And I do appreciate everyone's lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| I would like Director, or Director Moyers to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11103)|
| 3:05:08| Well, the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| The only reason we're under the time pressure is because this was coupled to, because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11110)|
| 3:05:16| approval of the growth plan was coupled to the adoption of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11116)|
| 3:05:21| So if the body believes that it needs more time to work on the comprehensive plan than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11121)|
| 3:05:28| is allowed by our May 27th deadline, then the answer would be to decouple them and let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11128)|
| 3:05:36| the growth plan approval stand on its own and take the time you need to adopt the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11136)|
| 3:05:44| plan that most suits you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11144)|
| 3:05:48| We've got some options out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11148)|
| 3:05:50| Let me move on to these other lights and we'll revisit what we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11150)|
| 3:05:55| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11155)|
| 3:05:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11157)|
| 3:05:58| My question is to the Wall Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| What are the consequences if we didn't do this by the deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11161)|
| 3:06:05| If we don't get this approved by the deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11167)|
| 3:06:08| The consequence, as the resolution currently stands, is if we have not adopted this by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11168)|
| 3:06:14| May 27th, then effectively we have not approved the growth plan and everything we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11174)|
| 3:06:19| for the last two years kind of goes down the drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11179)|
| 3:06:22| So that would not be the best of options, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11182)|
| 3:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11188)|
| 3:06:30| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11190)|
| 3:06:33| I'd go back to my previous thought pattern of I think the free market economy and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11193)|
| 3:06:42| individual land or lot that we're talking about at that point in time and the vote of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11202)|
| 3:06:47| the 11 should determine how it needs to be handled for going back to this planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11207)|
| 3:06:53| topic we were talking about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11213)|
| 3:06:54| So similar to what Commissioner Jay was talking about is I don't think we should handcuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11214)|
| 3:07:01| ourselves any further than we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| I think the 11 can make an educated decision at that point in time that, hey, this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11224)|
| 3:07:10| is whatever, but it actually makes more sense to do more density here because of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11230)|
| 3:07:16| have happened and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11236)|
| 3:07:17| So that's my opinion on that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11237)|
| 3:07:22| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11242)|
| 3:07:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| Silas, we've got a ring back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11247)|
| 3:07:28| I don't know if you can hear it out there, but I don't know about you guys, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11248)|
| 3:07:35| I'm totally, almost totally confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11255)|
| 3:07:40| I think Commissioner Jay's idea is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11260)|
| 3:07:45| My train of thought is I know Mr. Murphy would like to go from two to one on the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11265)|
| 3:07:54| It doesn't matter if it's one acre or five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11274)|
| 3:07:57| I'm 85 years old and I've got an acre or five acres of land and I need my son or my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11277)|
| 3:08:06| to come and build a house next to me to take care of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11286)|
| 3:08:09| I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11289)|
| 3:08:11| If we go to that, they wouldn't be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11291)|
| 3:08:15| If it's tied up, is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| If we go to one per acre or one per five acres, and I've got, I'm sitting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11297)|
| 3:08:24| there's people out there sitting on five acres of land and they're getting elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11304)|
| 3:08:30| They're only going to build one house on five acres of land when they need their family there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11310)|
| 3:08:35| next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11315)|
| 3:08:37| But if we've approved this, is it, am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11317)|
| 3:08:40| They can't do it, can they, Mr. Stodden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| Yes, or Director Brooks, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11323)|
| 3:08:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| It's my understanding that yes, as written, I guess is what Commissioner Frazier is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11331)|
| 3:08:58| that that would still be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11338)|
| 3:09:00| Is that, that's what I'm interpreting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11340)|
| 3:09:02| No, it wouldn't, it would not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11342)|
| 3:09:04| No, it would not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11344)|
| 3:09:05| No, it would not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11345)|
| 3:09:07| That would still be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11347)|
| 3:09:08| Is that, that's what I'm interpreting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11348)|
| 3:09:11| No, it wouldn't, it would not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11351)|
| 3:09:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11352)|
| 3:09:13| If you're limited to one dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11353)|
| 3:09:16| Per five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11356)|
| 3:09:18| Or per two, yeah, two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| If you considered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| What I'm saying is you own five acres of piece of property and you only have one dwelling unit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11363)|
| 3:09:31| Now we can have, my son can come and build a house on it beside me to help take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11371)|
| 3:09:37| myself or my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11377)|
| 3:09:38| If we change it to one dwelling unit per five acres, that can't happen no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11378)|
| 3:09:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11383)|
| 3:09:44| I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| I'm not for that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11386)|
| 3:09:48| Well, keep in mind though that the existing zoning stays in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11388)|
| 3:09:53| Not if we change it from two to one, one per acre or one per three acres or one per five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11393)|
| 3:10:01| You can't do it after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| No, it's my understanding that the existing zoning does, is retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11403)|
| 3:10:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| They just said you couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11410)|
| 3:10:14| It depends on your zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| What is your underlying zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| It's in the rural, the rural area, the rural resident or rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11417)|
| 3:10:22| Rural living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11422)|
| 3:10:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11423)|
| 3:10:23| And if you have, your property is zoned ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11423)|
| 3:10:27| We don't, yeah, we'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11427)|
| 3:10:29| It really matters what your, what your property is zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11429)|
| 3:10:32| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11432)|
| 3:10:32| Because that, that is what, that is what guides what you can actually do on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11432)|
| 3:10:40| This plan is meant to guide future land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11440)|
| 3:10:49| Commissioner Feeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11449)|
| 3:10:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11451)|
| 3:10:52| So that, that, that begs a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11452)|
| 3:10:55| So if we were to set rural living, I believe, I believe one suggestion was rural living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11455)|
| 3:11:05| in the, in the planned growth area would be one dwelling per two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11465)|
| 3:11:10| Am I right about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11470)|
| 3:11:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11472)|
| 3:11:16| And let's say the zoning of the property is ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11476)|
| 3:11:20| Would the rural living supersede the ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11480)|
| 3:11:25| Then, then in what situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11485)|
| 3:11:29| would something be zoned in a way that it would only be one per two acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11489)|
| 3:11:34| Well, the ag and rural living is directly related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11494)|
| 3:11:39| When this comes into play is when someone requests a change to their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11499)|
| 3:11:44| A change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11504)|
| 3:11:45| A change, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11505)|
| 3:11:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11506)|
| 3:11:46| So existing ag parcels, even if they were designated rural living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11506)|
| 3:11:52| the minimum would be one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11512)|
| 3:11:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11514)|
| 3:11:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11515)|
| 3:11:55| That clarifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11515)|
| 3:11:56| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| May I say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11518)|
| 3:12:01| So I appreciate the suggestion by Commissioner Jay, because I'm in total agreement that I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11521)|
| 3:12:07| I can't see a way forward to pass this Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11527)|
| 3:12:12| I really wish we could get it done by May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11532)|
| 3:12:17| I would want a hard deadline on it, even if it's June or whenever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11537)|
| 3:12:22| I think you suggested, Commissioner Jay, by the end of the fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11542)|
| 3:12:27| I think we worked very hard legislatively on this to couple these together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11547)|
| 3:12:34| because our constituents, mine in particular, were very concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11554)|
| 3:12:39| So I'm not going to break my commitment to them to keep them coupled together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11559)|
| 3:12:43| without hearing from them or without, at a minimum, a June deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11563)|
| 3:12:50| So just wanted to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11570)|
| 3:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11572)|
| 3:12:56| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11576)|
| 3:12:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| And to kind of go off what Commissioner Beeler just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11580)|
| 3:13:03| we had two other legislative bodies that may have taken that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11583)|
| 3:13:08| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11588)|
| 3:13:08| That they approved it based on us coupling it with this comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11588)|
| 3:13:15| So that's just also something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11595)|
| 3:13:18| And my intent was not to hold up the process at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11598)|
| 3:13:23| I don't think anyone feels that way, but, you know, it's just that looming deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11603)|
| 3:13:28| Yes, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11611)|
| 3:13:34| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11614)|
| 3:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11616)|
| 3:13:36| I just had a question for Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11616)|
| 3:13:38| I mean, do you feel like your constituents felt like we would never do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11618)|
| 3:13:45| And that was the most important thing, that you would actually complete the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11625)|
| 3:13:51| versus, I mean, do you think that the deadline of what we're under for the other half is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11631)|
| 3:13:57| was really under consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11637)|
| 3:13:58| Or did they think we would just punt this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11638)|
| 3:14:01| I think they wanted some assurance that we would not have a growth policy plan amendment in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11641)|
| 3:14:08| with no guardrails from an updated comprehensive plan for an undetermined amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11648)|
| 3:14:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11657)|
| 3:14:17| So, you know, and that really gave them some peace of mind when we coupled them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11657)|
| 3:14:24| Again, I don't want to, I don't know, strain out a gnat and swallow a camel, as Jesus would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11664)|
| 3:14:32| by saying, you know, we can't go beyond May 20th or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11672)|
| 3:14:36| But I would like for them to know that we're still sticking to our word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| that we are going to get this done and we're not going to let it go for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| Yeah, no, I think everybody's in the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11684)|
| 3:14:46| And what we have presented to us is, I mean, we're like 90% there, really 95% there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11686)|
| 3:14:53| It's tweaking the last bit of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| So I think if we can consider decoupling it on Monday, getting the deadline part done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11695)|
| 3:15:04| but at the exact same time saying, we will workshop it here, we will workshop it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11704)|
| 3:15:10| we will vote on it here and we will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| That would put us all in the clock and put us all in a definitive path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11713)|
| 3:15:19| And I'm happy to, you know, work through an idea for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| But I just, I really don't want to miss an opportunity to debate these types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11722)|
| 3:15:29| because we're just under the gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11729)|
| 3:15:31| If it gets us a better product, I think it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| I think our constituents would even appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| I see Kevin Murphy nodding his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11735)|
| 3:15:38| If I could interject and just comment before anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11738)|
| 3:15:42| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11742)|
| 3:15:43| I appreciate that you all see the weight of importance of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11743)|
| 3:15:48| But I've taken the last two months to work on the language and going page by page and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11748)|
| 3:15:58| section by section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11758)|
| 3:15:59| I've been doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| And so I don't, I don't see why at this point, those that have not should be granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11762)|
| 3:16:13| additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11773)|
| 3:16:14| And that's, that's not, we just got this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11774)|
| 3:16:17| We did not give us a red line version or any of your language until four hours ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11777)|
| 3:16:23| It's not, I don't think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11783)|
| 3:16:24| I did not mean to ruffle your feathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11784)|
| 3:16:27| I'm just saying, I have been working on this with staff and using opportunities to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11787)|
| 3:16:33| something forward when, when I asked the law department about, and I worked with IT to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11793)|
| 3:16:40| try to get these out on the forum, the platform will not support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11800)|
| 3:16:45| And then they went and found law stating that I couldn't attach a document because it had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11805)|
| 3:16:51| to be in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| There's nobody questioning your intention and there's nobody questioning your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11813)|
| 3:16:58| But it is, it's, it is not inconsiderate to say when you have nine pages of suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11818)|
| 3:17:09| things that we, you're asking us to vote on on Monday with some that are with options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11829)|
| 3:17:15| A, B, C, D, or whatever you want to put in here that the time for us to comprehensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11835)|
| 3:17:23| digest it is, is there is more time needed when we got this four hours ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11843)|
| 3:17:28| And I don't think anybody's questioning your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11848)|
| 3:17:31| And we have all been in the trenches of this, maybe not to the extent that you have, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11851)|
| 3:17:35| there's not a single one of us that hasn't thought about this entire process for two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11855)|
| 3:17:40| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11860)|
| 3:17:40| Again, I apologize if my comments seemed inconsiderate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11860)|
| 3:17:46| I just don't want to hold up the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| And I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11868)|
| 3:17:54| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11874)|
| 3:17:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11875)|
| 3:17:56| I know I want to comment too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11876)|
| 3:17:59| I know personally, no one is as passionate or works harder on this than Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11879)|
| 3:18:04| Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11884)|
| 3:18:05| But my point would be that even if all 11 of us had worked on this to that degree, coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11885)|
| 3:18:14| to a consensus on all those 11 viewpoints is, I don't think it's possible by Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11894)|
| 3:18:20| That's where I think the crux of this issue is, how are we going to get to a consensus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11900)|
| 3:18:27| And I think that's going to take more than a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11907)|
| 3:18:32| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11912)|
| 3:18:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11915)|
| 3:18:36| I have a question for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11916)|
| 3:18:38| Is it possible that we could pass what staff gave us and then work on the amendments the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11918)|
| 3:18:44| next month afterwards and give ourselves our own personal deadline to amend the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11924)|
| 3:18:50| 10% this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11930)|
| 3:18:53| It is your plan, and you can do with it what you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11933)|
| 3:18:56| So yes, you could pass what was sent to us from Planning Commission with the intent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11936)|
| 3:19:02| amending it at the next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11942)|
| 3:19:05| You could put it off the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11945)|
| 3:19:06| You could decouple it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11946)|
| 3:19:07| You could do pretty much any way you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| The only thing that we can't do is let the growth plan final approval slip past May 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11949)|
| 3:19:16| I'm just trying to think of what are all of our options on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11956)|
| 3:19:19| If we pass what staff has given us as a foundation, at least this way, that gets the ball moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11959)|
| 3:19:24| and gets us out from underneath the gun, then we can take a month, two months, three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11964)|
| 3:19:29| to debate, and we can set a time date here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| Like, hey, all the amendments need to be in by this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| Everybody bring your amendments on May whatever or June whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11973)|
| 3:19:38| And then we have debate the next month in July, and then August we'll have our final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11978)|
| 3:19:45| vote, and then it'll pass in September or whatever, or August, whatever the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11985)|
| 3:19:51| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11991)|
| 3:19:51| But is there a less stressful way where we can do more due diligence and there's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11991)|
| 3:19:58| people contributing or having time to process and all these other adjectives and whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=11998)|
| 3:20:05| Well, the one thing I would add, some of these, as I have suggested earlier this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12005)|
| 3:20:13| might require a look by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12013)|
| 3:20:17| So we want to be mindful that we need to look at them each in turn and make that determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12017)|
| 3:20:25| and hopefully have enough time that we can send the ones that are problematic back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12025)|
| 3:20:30| the Planning Commission for their advice so that we can pass these in a manner that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12030)|
| 3:20:36| is consistent with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12036)|
| 3:20:37| Because the last thing we want is to pass them without doing that and then getting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12037)|
| 3:20:41| overturned by a court because we didn't have that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12041)|
| 3:20:43| I think that kind of gives us two different avenues, too, because if these need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12043)|
| 3:20:47| back to planning, then all right, that's on this track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12047)|
| 3:20:50| And if there's ones that we all agree on, because, Kim, you've done an amazing job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12050)|
| 3:20:54| and I don't think anybody ever doubts the amount of effort and work you put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12054)|
| 3:20:58| There's things in here I definitely agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12058)|
| 3:21:00| I don't think anybody will have a problem with and would pass easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12060)|
| 3:21:04| So can we package those together and put them on the fast track to amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12064)|
| 3:21:07| And then the stuff that needs to take a little bit longer, process them at a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12067)|
| 3:21:11| speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12071)|
| 3:21:12| This way, we get out from underneath the gun, the people get what they want, there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12072)|
| 3:21:17| plan in place, and then we can fast track the ones we all agree on quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12077)|
| 3:21:21| And then the ones that we don't agree on, we can take an extra month to two months and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12081)|
| 3:21:25| get those ironed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12085)|
| 3:21:31| It allows a better process, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12091)|
| 3:21:35| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12095)|
| 3:21:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12096)|
| 3:21:37| I'm going to call on Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12097)|
| 3:21:47| There's two things I'd like to suggest before we have any more discussion on this after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12107)|
| 3:21:52| Commissioner Durrett speaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12112)|
| 3:21:54| I would personally like to hear from Mayor Williams, who has sat out here and listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12114)|
| 3:22:02| and certainly has a say, or perhaps not, in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12122)|
| 3:22:09| I have real concerns about a commitment that we made and a deadline that we set, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12129)|
| 3:22:17| for whatever reason, good or bad, I'm just saying, and took it to two other bodies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12137)|
| 3:22:22| then do not adhere to what we essentially promised that we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12142)|
| 3:22:28| But that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12148)|
| 3:22:30| So we've got a lot of suggestions out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12150)|
| 3:22:33| Commissioner Durrett, if you'd make your comments, Mayor Williams, if you would like to or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12153)|
| 3:22:38| you're welcome to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12158)|
| 3:22:39| And then I might just call for the—well, I can't call for the question because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12159)|
| 3:22:46| currently have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12166)|
| 3:22:52| All right, let me think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12172)|
| 3:22:55| Commissioner Durrett, please go ahead and address your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12175)|
| 3:22:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12178)|
| 3:23:00| I have a question for Director Moyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12180)|
| 3:23:03| So what would be the voting process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12183)|
| 3:23:07| We haven't really outlined that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12187)|
| 3:23:09| So we have nine pages of amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| Let's say we all agree to 70% of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12192)|
| 3:23:16| Do we vote on them individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12196)|
| 3:23:19| Can we do them as those 70% that we're all like, yeah, these are great, and then do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12199)|
| 3:23:25| remaining ones individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12205)|
| 3:23:26| Like, how would the voting work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| There's any number of ways you could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12208)|
| 3:23:30| I mean, you could vote them all up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12210)|
| 3:23:31| You could vote on each of them individually, which would take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12211)|
| 3:23:36| One thing that you could consider is handling them the way we handle our consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12216)|
| 3:23:41| and put them on the floor in toto and then allow commissioners to remove them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12221)|
| 3:23:47| any individual ones that are problematic, vote on what's left, and then debate the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12227)|
| 3:23:53| that have been removed from the main motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12233)|
| 3:23:57| That would be a way to approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12237)|
| 3:24:00| And that way, you could potentially get a bunch of them off the table at once and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12240)|
| 3:24:05| be left with the ones that people have issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12245)|
| 3:24:07| And those could be voted on, debated and voted on on Monday, or they could be delayed until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12247)|
| 3:24:12| another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12252)|
| 3:24:13| So that would be what I would suggest, because I think that would be the most efficient way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12253)|
| 3:24:19| to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12259)|
| 3:24:20| Not everything that's on here is going to cause people a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12260)|
| 3:24:23| And so the best way to do it is look at it and say, OK, who's got a problem with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12263)|
| 3:24:27| and pull them off and deal with them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12267)|
| 3:24:30| Thank you for that, Director Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12270)|
| 3:24:33| And to go off what Madam Chair Hill was just saying, we did make this original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12273)|
| 3:24:42| commitment that these two pass together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12282)|
| 3:24:46| And I know we're about to hear from Mayor Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12286)|
| 3:24:50| Thank you, Mayor, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12290)|
| 3:24:51| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12291)|
| 3:24:53| I just want to remind my colleagues that we do have another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12293)|
| 3:24:58| And if we were to postpone to May and end this 30-day time frame, we still are at an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12298)|
| 3:25:07| impasse with what to do at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12307)|
| 3:25:10| Since we will be approaching the deadline, we could potentially decouple then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12310)|
| 3:25:14| But I don't think we would need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| I don't think that these things that would give us more time to go through these, say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12316)|
| 3:25:21| what we like, what we don't, follow Director Moyer's advice, have them on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12321)|
| 3:25:26| We pull the ones we feel like we are just dead set we need to discuss and then go from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12326)|
| 3:25:32| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12332)|
| 3:25:32| And I think we can do this by May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12332)|
| 3:25:36| Next Monday, that's pretty, that's kind of a long shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12336)|
| 3:25:40| But that's how I feel that we can actually get this done and still keep to the deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12340)|
| 3:25:45| and still keep to our commitment of keeping these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12345)|
| 3:25:50| Just thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12350)|
| 3:25:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12350)|
| 3:25:53| Mayor Williams, thank you for stepping forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12353)|
| 3:25:58| I need to ask you to say your name and county residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12358)|
| 3:26:01| Yeah, Mayor Ron Williamstown Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12361)|
| 3:26:05| I have listened to great discussion here with everything that Commissioner Fraser had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12365)|
| 3:26:12| say and particularly with what Commissioner Durrett just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12372)|
| 3:26:18| With the town of Farragut, we just had one thing to look at and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12378)|
| 3:26:23| And that was growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| And the rest of it was most definitely you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12385)|
| 3:26:30| So, we did not have any sort of a thought about one being coupled to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12390)|
| 3:26:38| To us, it was one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12398)|
| 3:26:40| But if you feel you can get it done, then you possibly can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12400)|
| 3:26:44| But we did not have any notion that it had to be tied together in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12404)|
| 3:26:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12411)|
| 3:26:52| I guess that's probably all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12412)|
| 3:26:55| I would like to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| We have a motion on the table that we need to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12417)|
| 3:27:02| And that was made by Commissioner Durrett and seconded by Commissioner Fraser on item 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12422)|
| 3:27:07| which is approval to adopt the Knox County Comprehensive Land Use Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12427)|
| 3:27:15| I believe that was made with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12435)|
| 3:27:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12439)|
| 3:27:20| I'd like to call for the vote on that so we can get that put aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12440)|
| 3:27:28| If you'd like, we can continue discussion on the best way to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12448)|
| 3:27:32| So, without objection, I'm calling on the vote to pass this with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12452)|
| 3:27:44| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12464)|
| 3:27:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12465)|
| 3:27:46| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12466)|
| 3:27:47| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12469)|
| 3:27:49| Now, it appears that discussion circles around if we want to extend our deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12469)|
| 3:27:59| when we want to extend it to, and perhaps consideration of a special called workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12479)|
| 3:28:05| between now and whenever we do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12485)|
| 3:28:07| So, I've heard several recommendations and suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12487)|
| 3:28:14| I'm asking if anyone would like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12494)|
| 3:28:18| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12498)|
| 3:28:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12500)|
| 3:28:22| I know it's getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12502)|

| 3:28:27| I think I'm going to sort of pivot just a little bit and make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12507)|
| 3:28:32| that really respects our team who have, oh my gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12512)|
| 3:28:36| if they don't all run after this process, it'll be a miracle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12516)|
| 3:28:40| And they're as talented as anybody gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12520)|
| 3:28:44| I really like Commissioner Ward's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12524)|
| 3:28:47| And I would make a motion that we consider it on Monday if there are, and pass it as is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12527)|
| 3:28:57| then spend the next two months doing a block of amendments that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12537)|
| 3:29:01| It takes the pressure off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| It honors our commitment to Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12543)|
| 3:29:04| It honors our commitment to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12544)|
| 3:29:07| It honors our commitment to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12547)|
| 3:29:10| I think we're 90% there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| And set a date that has a workshop in May and put it back on the agenda for amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12552)|
| 3:29:19| Go ahead and put it on the agenda for amendments in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12559)|
| 3:29:21| Let's work through these details and get the pressure off and focus on the next level of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12561)|
| 3:29:28| So, I would, that's what I propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12568)|
| 3:29:33| So, if I understand your motion is to approve what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12573)|
| 3:29:39| What we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| Proceed with the vote on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| And if there are some, you know, either as is presented or if there are some very, very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12583)|
| 3:29:49| you know, easy amendments that can be put up on the agenda, you know, put up somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12589)|
| 3:29:55| or given to us within the next, you know, 72 hours so we can consider them over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12595)|
| 3:30:00| And just move on with the vote on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12600)|
| 3:30:03| And then go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12603)|
| 3:30:05| And I think we're all ready to continue to make it better and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12605)|
| 3:30:09| So, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12609)|
| 3:30:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12614)|
| 3:30:14| We have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Jay with a second Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12614)|
| 3:30:20| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12620)|
| 3:30:22| Clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12622)|
| 3:30:24| Are you saying to, is your motion to approve the comp plan as presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12624)|
| 3:30:32| Or is it with, because I cannot support pushing this forward and then coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12632)|
| 3:30:39| I would like to at least have some of my amendments be voted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12639)|
| 3:30:47| And I would say, I would say approve it as presented with amendments that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12647)|
| 3:30:52| very clearly redlined and given to us by the time the agenda hits on Thursday that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12652)|
| 3:30:59| consider, like Mr. Moyer said, we can consider it's all one block and pull them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12659)|
| 3:31:03| But, you know, taking everything we've done today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12663)|
| 3:31:06| If there are five amendments or seven amendments or 27 amendments that you feel like we're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12666)|
| 3:31:11| on the same page with, but we've got to have a very definitive redline version of this that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12671)|
| 3:31:16| says here's exactly what I'm proposing and we can go up and down, but proceed with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12676)|
| 3:31:21| vote on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12681)|
| 3:31:22| That's my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12682)|
| 3:31:23| And then put it on a date to continue to work on it over the next two months before fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12683)|
| 3:31:28| year end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12688)|
| 3:31:29| So, how will the body know what those proposed amendments are that you are for, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12689)|
| 3:31:36| you have suggestions of potential language change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12696)|
| 3:31:41| I think we can use the commission forum and you can, like you said, you could literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12701)|
| 3:31:45| say here are my proposed revisions, page 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12705)|
| 3:31:49| It says primary use is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12709)|
| 3:31:51| I would like to say primary use is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12711)|
| 3:31:54| And that's, that is one entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12714)|
| 3:31:56| And then we just take them as, and then we compile them for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12716)|
| 3:32:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12724)|
| 3:32:05| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we have a work session for Friday, May the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12725)|

| 3:32:36| of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12756)|
| 3:32:37| So, it would be the day after NOx planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12757)|
| 3:32:40| If they need to approve some changes that Commissioner Fraser outlined, that would all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12760)|
| 3:32:50| be done on the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12770)|
| 3:32:51| We would have just a final work session on that or whatever you want to call it on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12771)|
| 3:32:57| 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12777)|

| 3:33:00| On Wednesday, May 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12780)|

| 3:33:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12782)|
| 3:33:02| And if we can't go on to an impasse on the 15th, we have to roll it to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12782)|
| 3:33:09| Does staff have an opinion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12789)|
| 3:33:13| Because I'm willing to take all of the posted suggestions and revisions and put it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12793)|
| 3:33:20| one document and work with the law department on what if those could be on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12800)|
| 3:33:29| and then what needed additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12809)|
| 3:33:35| But I just, I'm looking to the leadership team about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12815)|
| 3:33:44| having another workshop and pushing the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12824)|
| 3:33:53| I think for us that we would like to see the comprehensive plan and the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12833)|
| 3:33:58| passed together to meet our, I don't want to say, I guess it was a promise to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12838)|
| 3:34:04| legislative bodies, but also I've been sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12844)|

| 3:34:12| I request that you use the plan that we put in front of you as a starting point and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12852)|
| 3:34:16| look at the amendments that Commissioner Fraser has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12856)|
| 3:34:20| We would like to have a vote next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12860)|
| 3:34:24| Also, I want to speak to Commissioner Schoonmaker's point of if Planning Commission hears anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12864)|
| 3:34:32| at the ninth meeting, it has to come as a recommendation requesting it be sent back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12872)|
| 3:34:36| to Planning Commission to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12876)|

| 3:34:48| by the Planning Commission and sent forward, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12888)|

| 3:34:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12896)|

| 3:35:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12907)|
| 3:35:07| Does anyone have any comments on the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12907)|
| 3:35:10| There's never a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12910)|

| 3:36:12| That way when the agenda comes out, we all have between Wednesday and Monday to digest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12972)|
| 3:36:19| every suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12979)|
| 3:36:21| And then we just take them one at a time or take them as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12981)|
| 3:36:24| It doesn't matter to me, but we vote on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12984)|
| 3:36:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12986)|
| 3:36:27| But there was a second part to yours that we would come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12987)|
| 3:36:31| No, I've amended my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12991)|
| 3:36:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12994)|
| 3:36:34| We're voting, my motion is to vote on Monday, put all your amendments on the table by end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12994)|
| 3:36:38| of day Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12998)|
| 3:36:39| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12999)|
| 3:36:39| Because my question was, if we do, in fact, approve whatever plan with whatever amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=12999)|
| 3:36:47| if we, we can't just come back the following month with more amendments because amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13007)|
| 3:36:52| are quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13012)|
| 3:36:55| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13015)|
| 3:36:56| We can do it in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13016)|
| 3:36:59| So I'm just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13019)|
| 3:37:00| That would be in the next quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13020)|
| 3:37:01| If we do, in fact, adopt the plan, amendments are listed as quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13021)|
| 3:37:07| So we couldn't make amendments again for another quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13027)|
| 3:37:10| We could do them in August before this body convened its legislative year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13030)|
| 3:37:14| It's due in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13034)|
| 3:37:16| It should be in the next quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13036)|
| 3:37:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13037)|
| 3:37:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13038)|
| 3:37:18| I would like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13038)|
| 3:37:21| Okay, I'm trying to remember what my motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13043)|
| 3:37:26| The motion on the floor right now is to vote on Monday with whatever we can agree on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13046)|
| 3:37:35| then revisit at a later date amendments to add to the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13055)|
| 3:37:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13063)|
| 3:37:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13064)|
| 3:37:45| I would like to make a substitute motion that we do not bring this to the floor on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13065)|
| 3:37:56| that we have a special called meeting, and that we do bring this to the floor in the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13076)|
| 3:38:05| I would like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13085)|
| 3:38:08| I just think it's more timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13088)|
| 3:38:10| It's keeping to what we have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13090)|
| 3:38:12| And I will add that the truth of the matter is anyone that's going to have any input on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13092)|
| 3:38:19| we've heard...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13099)|
| 3:38:20| They certainly will continue to add to it, but we can all probably count on two hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13100)|
| 3:38:28| the number of people that have stayed so involved, like Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13108)|
| 3:38:33| At this point in time to be so involved that they would come and say anything that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13113)|
| 3:38:42| probably so drastic that we would not move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13122)|
| 3:38:49| That may or may not be true, but my substitute motion is to postpone this final vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13129)|
| 3:38:57| to the May 20th meeting and to have a workshop to be determined between now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13137)|
| 3:39:07| devoted strictly to, and everyone come prepared to discuss these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13147)|
| 3:39:14| everything that Kim has brought, anything that you might want to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13154)|
| 3:39:19| at the special called meeting and be prepared to vote on it May 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13159)|
| 3:39:23| So that is my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13163)|
| 3:39:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13167)|
| 3:39:29| I've made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| Commissioner Lee has seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13171)|
| 3:39:34| Is there any discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13178)|
| 3:39:41| Asking if you're willing to amend it to add similar language to what Commissioner Jay has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13181)|
| 3:39:47| that I think it'd be nice that we all post our amendments that we would all like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13187)|
| 3:39:53| before that special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13193)|
| 3:39:54| This way the public can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13194)|
| 3:39:56| Everybody here can officially, hey, here it is out there in the open for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13196)|
| 3:40:00| This way we can all look and process instead of having it four hours beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13200)|
| 3:40:06| We didn't even get to Commissioner Buehler or anybody else's motions or amendments yet either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13206)|
| 3:40:12| So I'm cool with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13212)|
| 3:40:14| If everybody can, if we create a mechanism to do their homework and everybody post everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13214)|
| 3:40:20| so we can all have it ahead of time instead of having it, you know, the hour of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13220)|
| 3:40:26| I think this is what we call a process of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13226)|
| 3:40:27| When we have that special called meeting, we can have a more substantive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13227)|
| 3:40:32| discussion and kind of needle it down a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13232)|
| 3:40:35| So if we can put that mechanism in place, I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13235)|
| 3:40:38| So our goal, I might suggest, would be to post anything that you agree or disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13238)|
| 3:40:47| or want changed on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| I will ask our commission secretary to pull those together and have them as a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13249)|
| 3:40:57| that we'll work on during our special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13257)|
| 3:41:02| I think as Commissioner Jay has said, we are 95% of the way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13262)|
| 3:41:09| And I think even after we filter through the amendments that have been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13269)|
| 3:41:16| that we will still be extremely close to being able to have final discussion at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13276)|
| 3:41:24| commission, at the special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13284)|
| 3:41:28| So that is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| It has a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| Now, is there any discussion on my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13290)|
| 3:41:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| Or I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13297)|
| 3:41:37| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13297)|
| 3:41:39| Apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| I'll yield if you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13301)|
| 3:41:42| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13302)|
| 3:41:44| So in other words, the agenda item for next week will be showing as a deferral until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13304)|
| 3:41:49| May meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13309)|
| 3:41:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13310)|
| 3:41:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13311)|
| 3:41:54| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13314)|
| 3:41:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13314)|
| 3:41:56| Just a question for Director Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13316)|
| 3:42:00| Can we post all of those amendments similar to a consent agenda on the forum and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13320)|
| 3:42:09| give commissioners the opportunity to pull off what we do not have consensus on and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13329)|
| 3:42:15| rest be incorporated into the cooperative plan as we vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13335)|
| 3:42:19| Yes, I don't see a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13339)|
| 3:42:22| Like I said, I think that I may need to get together with Commissioner Frazier and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13342)|
| 3:42:29| Director Brooks next couple of days and go through some of these and make sure about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13349)|
| 3:42:34| the ones that might need to go back to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13354)|
| 3:42:37| But apart from that, I think that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13357)|
| 3:42:41| And then when you came to the meeting, you'd have one that everybody agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13361)|
| 3:42:47| You know, the original plus amendments that nobody's pulled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13367)|
| 3:42:50| That would be one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13370)|
| 3:42:52| And then however many have been pulled off, you could vote on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13372)|
| 3:42:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13375)|
| 3:42:58| I have a follow-up question to Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13378)|
| 3:43:01| In a conversation with posting my suggested amendments, I was discouraged not to post it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13381)|
| 3:43:10| on the forum because it gave the body basically how I was going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13390)|
| 3:43:20| Did I misunderstand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13400)|
| 3:43:22| I know there was a conversation with IT because the platform wouldn't support it and I couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13402)|
| 3:43:28| do certain things because of sunshine and I was discouraged from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13408)|
| 3:43:35| I can't speak to the IT issues, but the whole point of the forum is it's a way that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13415)|
| 3:43:44| can discuss matters in a way that's transparent so the public can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13424)|
| 3:43:49| Because we're under the permanent injunction against speaking outside of commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13429)|
| 3:43:56| or in a way that violates the Public Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| But the whole point of the forum is to allow you to discuss things in a way that the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13438)|
| 3:44:03| can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13443)|
| 3:44:04| So, first of all, I don't see any difference between that and posting the agenda and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13444)|
| 3:44:10| having people say, I want to remove this and this and this from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13450)|
| 3:44:15| If you put out on the forum your list of requested amendments and other commissioners are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13455)|
| 3:44:24| to go in and say, I would like this one removed, I would like this one removed, I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13464)|
| 3:44:29| this one removed, I would like this one removed, I would like this one removed, I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13469)|
| 3:44:33| this one removed from, we'll call it consent, even though it's not really that, then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13473)|

| 3:44:44| Knowing that, you would have a document that starts out, foundation of what was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13484)|
| 3:44:49| by Planning Commission, with the amendments that have been proposed and not pulled by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13489)|
| 3:44:55| any specific member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13495)|
| 3:44:58| What I would envision is you would vote on that and then you'd have whatever amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13498)|
| 3:45:03| let's say there were five or six that were removed, then you could have a separate discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13503)|
| 3:45:08| and vote on each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13508)|
| 3:45:11| That's how I would see that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13511)|
| 3:45:13| Or you could wait to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13513)|
| 3:45:15| You could post them all and then people could just say, I want to amend the motion by removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13515)|
| 3:45:23| X, Y, and Z from the main motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13523)|
| 3:45:28| Either one of those would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13528)|
| 3:45:30| It would give you the opportunity to have an easy vote on the plan and those amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13530)|
| 3:45:36| that aren't controversial and then have more time to discuss the ones that people might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13536)|
| 3:45:39| have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13539)|
| 3:45:42| And then my question again to staff about, and Madam Chair, you were saying a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13542)|
| 3:45:50| called meeting on May 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13550)|

| 3:45:55| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13555)|
| 3:45:56| I did not mean to say that date if I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13556)|
| 3:45:59| Sometime between now and our next voting meeting of May 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13559)|
| 3:46:05| So in this next four week window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13565)|
| 3:46:06| I still have concerns about the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13566)|
| 3:46:18| Are there any concerns about the timeline of doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13578)|
| 3:46:25| I believe we do have concerns with the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13585)|
| 3:46:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13588)|

| 3:46:33| They do have concerns about the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13593)|
| 3:46:34| So I think staff has been clear about they would like to see a vote on this on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13594)|
| 3:46:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13602)|

| 3:46:50| Why does staff feel that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13610)|
| 3:46:55| For me, if something is proposed at the May meeting and it has to be sent back to planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13615)|
| 3:47:00| commission, we have a deadline for growth policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13620)|
| 3:47:03| Yeah, but we talked about separating that out and trying in a different avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13623)|
| 3:47:08| That's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13628)|

| 3:47:12| That's a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13632)|
| 3:47:14| Yeah, it's a non issue if we separate those and send them on a different track than everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13634)|

| 3:47:28| changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=13648)|
