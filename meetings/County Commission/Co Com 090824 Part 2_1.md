| 2:37:46| They didn't vegetate an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| I've not seen a bank say, well, they're going to release it because of some damage that may have been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9468)|
| 2:37:54| I've not seen them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| So I think it would be rather difficult for us to get them to release it on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| They want to know specifically what this builder has not built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| and that's what they release them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| Okay, this lady had no problems until this developer came in, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9485)|
| 2:38:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| So evidently it came from the developer's construction somewhere to create a problem for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9492)|
| 2:38:18| But what about mediation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| I heard this talk about mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| Do you all ever mediate, sit down with a group of people and mediate the guy's problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| and come up with an agreement on how much money it's going to cost to fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9506)|
| 2:38:32| Do you all ever mediate, yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| We've had meetings with, actually, I'm going to defer to Laura.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9515)|
| 2:38:39| Did we ever meet with the Graysburg developers earlier on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9519)|
| 2:38:44| I guess we've had meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| We've mediated our problems, but not to the extent to which you're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| where we're going to say, I mean, we've mediated all kinds of different situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9531)|
| 2:38:55| I know, I work for the city of Stormwater, and Tim Graham, Graham Corporation on Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9535)|
| 2:39:01| we mediated with him, cost him $7,500 because he failed to do some things that he felt that should have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9541)|
| 2:39:07| or done or shouldn't have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| But we charged him $7,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| He paid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9551)|
| 2:39:12| Now, that money could have been used to repair this lady's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9552)|
| 2:39:16| And I think, Bruce, you said something about plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9556)|
| 2:39:19| We get the plans after it's been approved by MPC or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9559)|
| 2:39:27| Essentially, we get the drainage design plan after the property has been rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9567)|
| 2:39:32| after the subdivision concept plan has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9572)|
| 2:39:36| That's essentially, and I'm talking about subdivision development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| that's typically when a design plan is submitted in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9579)|
| 2:39:44| A design plan is not required at the zoning phase, nor is it typically required before a concept plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9584)|
| 2:39:51| But we have the authority to stop the plans if we don't agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| We don't just have to put a stamp on it and say, well, you should have brought them to us earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| If we see a problem with it, we can stop it and say, hey, you've got to go back and do this and this and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9598)|
| 2:40:03| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9603)|
| 2:40:04| Yes, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| And I think what a lot of residents want to do is they want to see what, at a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| what the finished product is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| Because in many cases, I've had situations where they've gone in, rezoned a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9612)|
| 2:40:16| and they've graded it extensively and changed the topography, not necessarily caused a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9616)|
| 2:40:21| It's oftentimes more of an aesthetics issue than it is a drainage issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| What about a NASBILT ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| We don't have a NASBILT ordinance, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| I know when we first started at Stormwater, we hired two new employees or some employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9632)|
| 2:40:37| How many did we get, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| Right now we've got about ten inspectors, six that deal with environmental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9639)|
| 2:40:47| and four that deal with infrastructure, which is roads and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9647)|
| 2:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| Well, I just think we need to look at these opportunities we have, whether it be the bond or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| I think there's several things that we're doing, you know, proactively or whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| in regards to like the environmental bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| We're in the process of also just hiring and being able to budget an office manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9668)|
| 2:41:14| that will take some of this paperwork off the inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| and give them the opportunity to spend more time in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9677)|
| 2:41:21| Because, you know, what we're looking to do is to solve â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9681)|
| 2:41:24| we want to be on the front end of the problem, not on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| For instance, in NASBILT, if they tell me that the tension basin isn't to size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| well, yeah, I can go out there and get them to enlarge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| But if I've got an inspector out there, when they're out there building the thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| and he sees it's not going into size, that's the time to catch this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| Or if I've got a development that says, you know, we're only going to grade these three or four acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9702)|
| 2:41:47| and an inspector comes back six weeks or two weeks later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| and he's graded an area twice that large, the damage has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| I mean, I can cite them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9715)|
| 2:41:56| I can give them a citation and all that stuff, but that's not what we want to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9716)|
| 2:42:00| We want to be getting this on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| But if you don't â€“ you can stop the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| I mean, you can be able to stop work order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| But that goes right back into what I'm saying is that I can stop the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| but oftentimes the work that has taken place is what's causing the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| is that they've disturbed a much bigger area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| You have a tree buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9736)|
| 2:42:17| I can't go in there and reestablish, you know, 20-year-old trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9737)|
| 2:42:20| They go in a chainsaw and level the place in a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| And I can't go â€“ now, I can penalize them for that and fine them and all that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9742)|
| 2:42:26| but yet the damage has been done and in many cases it cannot be restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9746)|
| 2:42:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| Commissioner Brown, did you have something on Ms. Cole's situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9753)|
| 2:42:37| I want to go back to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| One thing on Ms. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9761)|
| 2:42:42| Did I understand you to say that conservatively the damage done to Ms. Cole's property is $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9762)|
| 2:42:49| Is that what I understood you to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9769)|
| 2:42:53| That if we were to go in and try to repair it, it would cost $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9773)|
| 2:42:57| I want to make sure I understand what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| To say that that's the damage done is probably a bit more than I was actually saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9782)|
| 2:43:06| What I was saying was that to do a restoration project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9786)|
| 2:43:10| where you basically go and reshape the stream and make it so that it's hydraulically stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9790)|
| 2:43:15| it doesn't erode and there's not erosive materials or sediment in the bottom of the stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9795)|
| 2:43:19| that gets suspended every time it rains, could easily cost that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9799)|
| 2:43:24| Is that the extent of the damages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| And that's sort of what I was getting at, that our solution is â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9808)|
| 2:43:31| our proposal is more looking towards a solution, something that lends a permanent livable, workable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9811)|
| 2:43:38| environmentally sound solution to a problem that Ms. Cole is experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9818)|
| 2:43:42| It doesn't necessarily assign a particular value to damage that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9822)|
| 2:43:47| I'm just kind of dovetailing what Commissioner Armstrong was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| is here you have a constituent who bought property, and through no fault of her own now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| she's looking at $100,000 to get something fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| That was no fault of hers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| We have to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| And so I'm through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| I guess we're now ready to start talking about process, but we have to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| There's no way that we can allow our citizens to endure this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9851)|
| 2:44:19| Commissioner Carrington, did you want to speak to Ms. Cole's situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9859)|
| 2:44:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| It looks like we're all in agreeance that you did not have this problem until the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9864)|
| 2:44:29| started with his phase one, and that it definitely was caused by him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9869)|
| 2:44:34| And from what I understand, this same developer also has a phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9874)|
| 2:44:40| Well, I think that he needs to take care of Ms. Cole's problem before he even begins to even think about doing a phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9880)|
| 2:44:48| And if he runs out of money and he doesn't get to do phase two after taking care of her problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9888)|
| 2:44:53| then that's not county commission's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| That was him not being prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9896)|
| 2:44:59| Also, I wanted to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| You said the stream litigation program was coming to help with three project owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9901)|
| 2:45:07| Did I understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| So is Laura Cole and a couple other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| No, the stream that's downstream of the Graysburg development is actually located on three different properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9914)|
| 2:45:21| So it would involve Ms. Cole's property, I guess the property of the development itself or the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9921)|
| 2:45:29| And there's a third party, I think it's just an agricultural tract that actually has, I think, the larger part of the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9929)|
| 2:45:37| Well, the reason why I was asking that is we've also had this same problem in District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9937)|
| 2:45:42| And one particular landowner that I'm thinking about, Mr. McMillan, who has his farm with the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9942)|
| 2:45:50| with having similar problems, I just wondered if we were able to bring that in to addressing the same issue that he had been having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9950)|
| 2:46:04| Well, that may be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| That's not something that we've considered or been presented with the same sort of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9966)|
| 2:46:14| But, yeah, it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| It might be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9976)|
| 2:46:25| I guess we'll go back to Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| I guess we can talk about process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| I won't keep it short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9990)|
| 2:46:33| I'm not quite finished with the topic, if you all don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9993)|
| 2:46:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9997)|
| 2:46:38| Is there somebody else who wants to talk about Ms. Cole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=9998)|
| 2:46:43| Am I the only one who wants to talk about Ms. Cole left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10003)|
| 2:46:46| I don't want to jump in front of somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| I'll keep the list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10008)|
| 2:46:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| Ms. Cole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| I think we'd be remiss if we didn't ask you what you thought after hearing 45 minutes of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10015)|
| 2:47:04| What I think about the proposed solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| What do you think about what you've heard about your situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10026)|
| 2:47:11| These are responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| I'm not particularly optimistic because it's been three years and nothing's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10033)|
| 2:47:18| And we're talking about having people come in and look at the site to figure out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10038)|
| 2:47:27| When I go and look at the site, I see some specific drainage issues that I think should be addressed directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10047)|
| 2:47:35| In particular, lot 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| I think that's a very obvious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10057)|
| 2:47:41| I have no choice but to be optimistic and hope that whoever comes in and looks at this site will assess it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10061)|
| 2:47:48| and come up with some real discrete concrete solutions that will stop the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10068)|
| 2:47:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10074)|
| 2:47:55| When we say TSMP is the way that this is going to take place, that just seems very fuzzy to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10075)|
| 2:48:04| It sounds like it's going to take a really long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| A very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10086)|
| 2:48:07| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10087)|
| 2:48:08| So three years in, you're in the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10088)|
| 2:48:16| It's just not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| And I don't know what the solution is right now, but we're going to stay after it until something gets done for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10098)|
| 2:48:26| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10106)|
| 2:48:27| I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10111)|
| 2:48:32| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10112)|
| 2:48:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| I think Ms. Cole has hit on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10115)|
| 2:48:38| We need to be a little more proactive and make sure this doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| We need to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| The process as far as getting engineering involved and the planning stages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10125)|
| 2:48:52| I think we should probably have some type of resolution asking MPC and the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10132)|
| 2:49:01| to come back with some type of ordinance change that we can address this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10141)|
| 2:49:08| to make sure that those on the ground that are going to have to do the enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10148)|
| 2:49:13| are involved sooner in the process before they get their plans done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10153)|
| 2:49:19| and maybe even before we do some rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| The other thing, I'm going to try to keep this short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| the other thing we need to do is we need to identify those who continuously violate our ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10165)|
| 2:49:35| and do not adhere to the codes and no longer grant rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10175)|
| 2:49:48| and no longer grant plans until they get what they already have taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10188)|
| 2:49:56| This gentleman does not need to go on to phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10196)|
| 2:49:59| So I think we need to address those issues, and I would like to see something done about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10199)|
| 2:50:06| Maybe next month we can put forth a resolution asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10206)|
| 2:50:10| or directing MPC and engineering to get together and come back with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10210)|
| 2:50:15| so that engineering is in the loop even sooner than what they are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10215)|
| 2:50:22| Well, that was the purpose of my opening remarks in talking about this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10222)|
| 2:50:28| to get these items out on the table and discuss them with those that are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10228)|
| 2:50:33| and try to have something to bring back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| This group could sit and debate those issues for two hours, three hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10236)|
| 2:50:43| and still not any closer than where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10243)|
| 2:50:46| But until we can get the parties that are involved together and sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10246)|
| 2:50:52| and have a workshop on it and determine what some solutions might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10252)|
| 2:50:59| then we can make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10259)|
| 2:51:00| But right now we don't know what we're changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10260)|
| 2:51:03| Well, that might be why we need to put it on the agenda for next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10263)|
| 2:51:07| so that we can discuss that at our regular commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10267)|
| 2:51:11| asking engineering to come forward with their ideas of how they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10271)|
| 2:51:17| that they can get into the process sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10277)|
| 2:51:20| I wish MPC was still here so they could hear this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| Well, but there again you're bringing in one party this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| and then there will be another month where we need to bring in somebody from another division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10288)|
| 2:51:33| Why not get them all together at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| Well, if you like, I'll make a motion right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| if we can get it to have direct MPC and engineering to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10298)|
| 2:51:45| That's what Chris is working on now, setting this meeting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| Well, then I'm not sure what your point is, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10308)|
| 2:51:52| I mean, I'm asking them to do what you have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| I mean, short of a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| If they're getting together, then they're getting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10319)|
| 2:52:02| That included us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10325)|
| 2:52:06| Any interested parties, I should put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| Well, MPC is going to discuss this matter, and before they. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10329)|
| 2:52:15| I mean, they're going to vote on something on any type of ordinance change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| that they're going to recommend to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10338)|
| 2:52:22| I mean, I'm not real sure how or where we put the engineering into the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10342)|
| 2:52:33| I mean, at what point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| Mr. Cole, do you have any. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10355)|
| 2:52:36| Well, we have to know what they're able to do and when and what point they're able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10356)|
| 2:52:42| Again, I don't see any need to piecemeal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10362)|
| 2:52:45| If we get them all together at the same table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| those questions can be asked back and forth across the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10367)|
| 2:52:50| and hammer out a solution at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| Well, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10373)|
| 2:52:54| That's why I'm saying that the engineering and MPC needs to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| Now, if you think that we need to be at the table at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| then I guess we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| I agree with Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10384)|
| 2:53:05| I think because we're trying to change the way we're doing things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10385)|
| 2:53:09| we need all the parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10389)|
| 2:53:10| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10390)|
| 2:53:11| I think we need county commissioners, MPC commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10391)|
| 2:53:14| I think we need engineering staff at the table to discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10394)|
| 2:53:17| because if you look at it together, it's all one big process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10397)|
| 2:53:21| but that's not what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| We're sort of working independently, and so there's gaps in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:26| Then if we'd like to have a workshop inviting all of the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10406)|
| 2:53:31| then that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| I think we need to get this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| So I'll propose that we have a workshop and invite commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10415)|
| 2:53:40| MPC commissioners, the staff, and engineering so that we can have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10420)|
| 2:53:45| and I think we should have this done, I would think, within sometime in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10425)|
| 2:53:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10432)|
| 2:53:53| As we say, is that a motion you're making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| I'll make a motion directing the chairman to put together a workshop on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10435)|
| 2:54:03| What are you proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| Well, we need to know the availability of either we're going to have it in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10446)|
| 2:54:10| or the small assembly room, and we don't know the availability of those rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10450)|
| 2:54:15| but if we could have it prior to next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10455)|
| 2:54:20| Well, that wouldn't preclude the engineering, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| getting together and putting together some solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10465)|
| 2:54:28| Well, I think that they should do a little work before we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10468)|
| 2:54:32| That's what I was really proposing, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| was that they need to get something started so that when they come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| so that we actually sit down, we have some things to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10479)|
| 2:54:45| But I'd like to see a workshop done before our next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10485)|
| 2:54:49| So, Bruce, can you get in touch with me when you get some things together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10489)|
| 2:54:54| and I can go ahead and go ahead and set it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10494)|
| 2:55:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10502)|
| 2:55:06| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10506)|
| 2:55:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10509)|
| 2:55:10| When is this guy supposed to start Phase 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10510)|
| 2:55:15| Has he already been approved to start Phase 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10515)|
| 2:55:19| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10519)|
| 2:55:22| I think his concept, I'd have to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| I don't think he's pulled any permits from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| I'm fairly certain he's got a concept plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| I do not know if he's got a drainage design plan approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10531)|
| 2:55:34| but as far as I know, he's not pulled any permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10534)|
| 2:55:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10537)|
| 2:55:38| And what is he currently doing in Phase 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| Is he still currently working on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| There's construction ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| Actually, it's more in relation to just single-family lot construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10544)|
| 2:55:48| the actual major grading as far as the roads and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10548)|
| 2:55:52| But he is currently conducting work at the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10552)|
| 2:55:55| I don't know if it's him specifically, because you can go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10555)|
| 2:55:58| and, for instance, you can go in there and buy a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| So you would end up building a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| So, therefore, on your own lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| you would be required to maintain your own erosion control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10564)|
| 2:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| But he may be also building houses in there, too, also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| But I do know that an individual property owner can do likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| Well, what do we need to do to make sure that he cannot pull any permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10577)|
| 2:56:19| or do any kind of work on a Phase 2 project until this has been taken care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10579)|
| 2:56:26| That you may have to ask the law director, because here's the situation we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10586)|
| 2:56:30| is that if they're in compliance with our ordinance, I mean, if you're in compliance with the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10590)|
| 2:56:39| I mean, if push comes to shove, I could withhold the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| But if he shows up up there with an attorney and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| well, you show me in the ordinance that says I can't have a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10605)|
| 2:56:48| there's nothing in there that says, well, because you're a bad actor on another development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10608)|
| 2:56:54| you can't have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| There's nothing in the ordinance that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| So if he meets all the requirements, we would be forced into giving him a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10618)|
| 2:57:01| Now, I can sit back and say, hey, the county commission has got a real problem with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10621)|
| 2:57:05| You need to make a trip down there and talk with them about this and go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10625)|
| 2:57:10| But at the end of the day, I don't think we could withhold a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10630)|
| 2:57:13| He would have to not meet some conditions of the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10633)|
| 2:57:17| Can you check into that, Joe, and see if there's some way we can prevent him from doing something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10637)|
| 2:57:24| until we get this mess cleaned up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| Well, Commissioner, I'd have to get a factual scenario from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10646)|
| 2:57:31| But, again, I mean, the law is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| If he is in compliance, the permit has to be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| He has due process on that aspect, regardless if he shows up with an attorney or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10657)|
| 2:57:41| The bottom line is, you know, regardless, and I'm not being cavalier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10661)|
| 2:57:46| I know how egregious this is for the landowner and the adjoining landowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| but if he's in compliance with our codes, we can't penalize him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| even if he's doing something that's injurious to a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| That's what the civil redress is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10680)|
| 2:58:01| Laura, what is the next step you would like us to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10681)|
| 2:58:06| I mean, if we could do anything to help you right now, what would you want us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10686)|
| 2:58:13| Could you find me another farm and some other cattle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10693)|
| 2:58:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| Well, I mean, I think what you're doing right now is very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10699)|
| 2:58:25| Someone in my court that's looking out for my rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| and holding the developer and ourselves accountable for following the law as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10709)|
| 2:58:37| So I can't think of anything you can do other than push for exactly what you're pushing for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10717)|
| 2:58:43| Should you allow Phase 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| Is there a way to stop Phase 2 until this is fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| I think that's a question that you can ask as a commissioner that's very helpful to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10728)|
| 2:58:54| So what we need to decide, then, as part of this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10734)|
| 2:58:57| is how do we hold these developers accountable when something like this happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10737)|
| 2:59:01| Well, that's what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| For those developers that are not staying in compliance, they're habitual offenders of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10743)|
| 2:59:09| we don't need to be granting them rezonings or concept plan approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| So is there anything that they're â€“ I mean, what are they out of compliance on now, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10753)|
| 2:59:17| I mean, are they being fined right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10757)|
| 2:59:21| Can you issue a stop work order until they fix something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10761)|
| 2:59:25| I think, again, Chris probably has a better handle on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| That's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| When you go out there, you don't find â€“ I think what Chris related to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10770)|
| 2:59:34| or actually even Commissioner Lambert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10774)|
| 2:59:38| a lot of the damage that's been done has been deposited in the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10778)|
| 2:59:42| And so that's really what part of the â€“ that's what the major part of this problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10782)|
| 2:59:46| There may be some minor things that they're not compliant with, and we can get them in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| But the major part of the damage and the problem she's experienced has already been deposited in the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10790)|
| 2:59:55| and that's why we're looking at a creek restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10795)|
| 2:59:58| Well, if there's minor things that they're not in compliance with right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10798)|
| 3:00:01| why are they not being fined and made to fix those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10801)|
| 3:00:04| Well, they have been followed up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| They've been issued notice of violations, that sort of thing, in regards to other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| Are they being fined with these notices of violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| Are they being fined every day that they're not in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10812)|
| 3:00:14| It depends on what they're noncompliant about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10814)|
| 3:00:18| And Chris, if I had to answer the direct enforcement aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10818)|
| 3:00:21| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| Yeah, they â€“ I think you just â€“ you'd have to look at the sites that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10823)|
| 3:00:28| look at the lots out there to get a good understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| In one case, it was probably an area smaller than this carpeted area between your cables that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10831)|
| 3:00:37| just didn't have ground cover, and we issued a civil penalty and a notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10837)|
| 3:00:44| Did they fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10844)|
| 3:00:45| Yeah, they fixed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10845)|
| 3:00:46| They've got controls in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| The actual developers have been very responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10848)|
| 3:00:53| They've done what the counties asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10853)|
| 3:00:56| They've done what the states asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10856)|
| 3:00:59| There again, it points out the point that there's other issues at play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10859)|
| 3:01:03| things like what type of soil is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| Is this a soil that the controls that we normally think are okay are not good enough for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10865)|
| 3:01:12| Normally, if you have an area this size and it's not real stable or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10872)|
| 3:01:17| it doesn't have an extreme impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| It doesn't have something that's worthy of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| putting on the commission agenda for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| But obviously, this is a case that's different from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10886)|
| 3:01:32| But every time that there's been an issue with development level or lot level enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10892)|
| 3:01:38| we've responded, we've issued notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| We have a very defined protocol that we've developed over the past couple of years for our enforcement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10900)|
| 3:01:47| And it's certainly been tried and exercised extensively at the Graysburg development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10907)|
| 3:01:54| How much in fines have we collected from this developer on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10914)|
| 3:02:00| I wish I had that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10922)|
| 3:02:05| Can you fine him for every day he's not in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10925)|
| 3:02:09| And do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| In this case, the most recent case was an area where a house was being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10934)|
| 3:02:22| and we issued a civil penalty, and we were contacted by the builder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10942)|
| 3:02:29| and he got controls in place within 24 hours, and the issue was apparently resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10949)|
| 3:02:36| That doesn't mean there's not going to be an issue tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| But it did not appear to necessitate going out every day and issuing a civil penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10958)|
| 3:02:44| It also brings up another point that Bruce alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| Every time that civil penalty is issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| that same inspector who could be out on the site is back in the office doing all the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10970)|
| 3:02:55| making stamps, and everything involved with sending the certified letter to the builder is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10975)|
| 3:03:05| We do it all ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| So that's certainly a consideration being practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10987)|
| 3:03:10| We have to balance out being able to cover every area that needs to be covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10990)|
| 3:03:14| and getting the enforcement done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| Because I know this isn't the only place in the county that's having problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10996)|
| 3:03:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11002)|
| 3:03:23| Laura, is there anything else that you would like to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11003)|
| 3:03:27| or anything else you can think of that we could be doing for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11007)|
| 3:03:33| Not necessarily for me, but one of the things that I wanted to mention was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11013)|
| 3:03:38| there was a stormwater advisory board pulled together in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11018)|
| 3:03:42| and I served on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11022)|
| 3:03:46| It was citizens and developers and engineering staff participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11026)|
| 3:03:51| That group met for two years at some expense to the county and produced a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11031)|
| 3:03:59| It might be very helpful for commission to have a copy of the 10-page executive summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11039)|
| 3:04:04| because that summarizes the recommendations that came from this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11044)|
| 3:04:08| and the recommendations are going to look very familiar to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| But where can we find that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| Do we have that on file somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11053)|
| 3:04:19| Let me answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| Here, that's really part of this whole proposal for a workshop or a training session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11061)|
| 3:04:28| We really want to bring everybody up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| There have been a lot of suggestions for things that, quite frankly, have already been suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11070)|
| 3:04:35| There are good ideas, a lot of things that have actually been implemented that maybe folks aren't aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11075)|
| 3:04:40| I think a good starting point, this workshop that's proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11080)|
| 3:04:46| really needs to be something like a stormwater regulations 101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| and then from there progressing into the recommendations from the stormwater advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11090)|
| 3:04:59| I think that if we're able to do that, I think we can all be on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11099)|
| 3:05:04| and all be looking at these issues with at least a similar background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11104)|
| 3:05:09| and hopefully a similar mind as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11109)|
| 3:05:11| Could we get a copy of that before the workshop so we might have a chance to peruse it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11111)|
| 3:05:16| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11116)|
| 3:05:18| Wasn't there a study done, I'm not sure how many years ago, by, I forget his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11118)|
| 3:05:30| Let me see if I can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11130)|
| 3:05:38| Laura, do you remember what I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| Talking about Mr. Maynard's report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| Yes, Mr. Maynard's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| Do you know who's got the original of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| Can we get copies of that for everyone too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| I have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| Okay, I think that would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| For the record, a lot of the findings and conclusions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| well, a lot of the information in that report is just false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11159)|
| 3:06:03| There's no way to sugar coat it, and so it's not very helpful for a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11163)|
| 3:06:08| if we want to move forward and work towards solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11168)|
| 3:06:11| What do you mean false?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11171)|
| 3:06:14| He never met with my staff to discuss any of it before doing the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11174)|
| 3:06:20| He didn't spend any time whatsoever with our staff in Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11180)|
| 3:06:27| No, I think it's basically a report of what he found when he was out talking to people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11187)|
| 3:06:31| who were having problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11191)|
| 3:06:33| I don't think that necessarily makes it false,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| it just means that unfortunately he didn't contact you guys after he spoke to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11195)|
| 3:06:39| Still one-sided though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| Yeah, it is one-sided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| I think the interpretations as they reference regulations in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11203)|
| 3:06:48| or really state regulations, federal regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11208)|
| 3:06:51| there's a lot of fallacies there, and at the time that generated a lot of discussion like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11211)|
| 3:06:55| that ultimately was to no benefit for anybody because it was based on somewhat false pretense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11215)|
| 3:07:02| of what kind of regulations were in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11222)|
| 3:07:06| I don't believe we have a copy of that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11226)|
| 3:07:09| I don't believe we ever actually received a copy, but certainly there may be one around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11229)|
| 3:07:15| I was going to say that the only value in that report then may be that it was probably one of the drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| of the Stormwater Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| It may have been one of the drivers that kicked it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11242)|
| 3:07:24| So it may be worth looking at just as part of the discussion in a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11244)|
| 3:07:27| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11250)|
| 3:07:36| Somebody once said only Nixon could go to China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11256)|
| 3:07:43| You know, I am probably one of the most pro-development folks that sits on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11263)|
| 3:07:51| but I see the problem that we have here and I see the problems that we've had in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11271)|
| 3:07:57| and I've had some great opportunities because of the type of rains that we've been getting lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11277)|
| 3:08:03| We've been getting these rains where a lot of rain falls down all at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11283)|
| 3:08:08| and so I wanted to reexamine my stance, and I am pro-growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11288)|
| 3:08:13| I am pro-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| I believe that development and growth are good for a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11295)|
| 3:08:19| but I wanted to examine the stormwater issue again just to see if there was anything that I may have been wrong on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11299)|
| 3:08:28| and we have several problems in my district right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11308)|
| 3:08:32| and the thing that I've found is that primarily there are two problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11312)|
| 3:08:38| Number one is older subdivisions that were built prior to the current stormwater regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11318)|
| 3:08:46| They just don't manage their water at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| In fact, me and Mr. Ivan Harmon, there was a subdivision that was really close to, it was in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11328)|
| 3:08:55| but it was very close to his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| and he and I went out and worked with the stormwater folks on solving the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11337)|
| 3:09:01| and I think we made some progress there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11341)|
| 3:09:05| but it was an old subdivision where there's no stormwater system really in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11345)|
| 3:09:09| and I think we did the best we could with what solution we could offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11349)|
| 3:09:14| I've also looked at several new subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11354)|
| 3:09:17| and I'll have to say that the newer subdivisions with stormwater systems that are compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11357)|
| 3:09:26| notice I say compliant with current stormwater regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11366)|
| 3:09:31| manage water far, far better than these older subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11371)|
| 3:09:37| but the problem that I see is it is not air regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11377)|
| 3:09:41| It is not the subdivisions that were built that were compliant with air regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11381)|
| 3:09:48| It's when folks don't obey the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11388)|
| 3:09:51| and I think that there's a couple of things that we need to do to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11391)|
| 3:09:55| and I'm sure that a lot of my developer friends won't like what I'm about to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11395)|
| 3:10:00| but I think I'm looking out for their best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| as well as the community's best interest when I say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11403)|
| 3:10:07| I think that we need to start having some bonds to deal with these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11407)|
| 3:10:13| because, like Mr. Weetrick just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11413)|
| 3:10:17| when someone doesn't comply with what they're supposed to do, they do damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11417)|
| 3:10:22| This woman has been damaged, and I think six figures worth of damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11422)|
| 3:10:28| If we had an insurance system in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11428)|
| 3:10:31| and I know I'm going to get a million calls tomorrow telling me insurance is expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11431)|
| 3:10:35| and bonds are expensive, but the truth is not having insurance is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11435)|
| 3:10:41| It's expensive for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| It's either expensive for the developer who gets sued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11443)|
| 3:10:47| or it's expensive for the community that has to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11447)|
| 3:10:50| and the taxpayers have to pay the six-figure cleanup costs to restore this woman's stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11450)|
| 3:10:58| I think that the regulations we have in place are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11458)|
| 3:11:03| I think that we need to look at adding some staff to Mr. Weetrick's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11463)|
| 3:11:07| so that he can better enforce these regulations that work fine when they're followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11467)|
| 3:11:13| and I think that we need to have some sort of a bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11473)|
| 3:11:16| some sort of an insurance policy that the developers have to buy when they start the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11476)|
| 3:11:22| so that there's money available to fix these problems when they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11482)|
| 3:11:27| And again, I know I'm going to get a lot of people saying, well, that's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11487)|
| 3:11:30| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11490)|
| 3:11:32| It's actually going to be cheaper if everybody buys a bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11492)|
| 3:11:35| if everybody buys an insurance policy to cover when folks don't obey the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11495)|
| 3:11:42| or when accidents happen, because we need some money available to fix this woman's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11502)|
| 3:11:48| And when this happens in the future, we need to have a system in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11508)|
| 3:11:54| to where there is a mechanism in place to where there is money readily available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11514)|
| 3:11:59| to pay to fix these problems, because there's a lot of folks out there that don't obey the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11519)|
| 3:12:06| And a lot of times it's not their fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11526)|
| 3:12:08| They didn't have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11528)|
| 3:12:10| They stripped some lots to build some houses on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11530)|
| 3:12:13| and then they didn't have the money to build the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11533)|
| 3:12:16| so we've got red clay mountains rolling down into the neighbor's field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11536)|
| 3:12:21| It costs money to clean that stuff up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| and I think that we need to set up some sort of a system where we require some sort of bonding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11543)|
| 3:12:29| so that there's money available to fix these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11549)|
| 3:12:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| Commissioner, I don't know who's been here more, you or Brad Mays, as many times as you've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11557)|
| 3:12:43| Bruce, I appreciate what you and Chris are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| I mean, you guys are working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11565)|
| 3:12:49| I know you want to see a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11569)|
| 3:12:52| Well, we've seen you here time and time again, but I've yet to see the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11572)|
| 3:12:56| I don't know who the developer is, but if we're going to have this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11576)|
| 3:13:00| I would like, Mr. Law Director, if we could, I would like to have, let's write a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11580)|
| 3:13:05| let's have these individuals here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11585)|
| 3:13:07| A subpoena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11587)|
| 3:13:08| A subpoena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11588)|
| 3:13:09| And the same people for Mr. McMillan that he's got in his area in the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11589)|
| 3:13:15| and let's let some of these people answer some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11595)|
| 3:13:18| I mean, because we keep hearing from you and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| and I want to hear from these developers as to who's doing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11601)|
| 3:13:26| I mean, we need to let the people know who's a good developer and who's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11606)|
| 3:13:34| You know, if there's some problems that they couldn't foresee or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| and Bruce can testify to that and Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11617)|
| 3:13:40| but I'm for bringing some of these people here, commissioners, at these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11620)|
| 3:13:45| and let's have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| They're not going to like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11627)|
| 3:13:48| They may not come, but I would like to, if we could, subpoena them, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11628)|
| 3:13:54| to try to get to the answer, because we've heard from this lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11634)|
| 3:13:57| And, Laura, you're doing an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| You're very professional in what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11639)|
| 3:14:00| You're not just screaming and hollering and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11640)|
| 3:14:03| I really appreciate the way that you have come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11643)|
| 3:14:06| and there's other people out there that have just quit screaming and hollering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11646)|
| 3:14:10| because nothing seems to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| And work with these gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| You know, these are some of the professionals, and get these others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11655)|
| 3:14:18| but let's bring them down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11658)|
| 3:14:21| We've heard from you month after month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11661)|
| 3:14:23| I want to see the individuals that are doing this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11663)|
| 3:14:29| Commissioner Koenig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| Well, one of my questions is, is how are they in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11671)|
| 3:14:35| if there's causing the runoff water to still be happening on Mrs. Ko's property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11675)|
| 3:14:43| And one, she said if there could be something done to lot 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11683)|
| 3:14:48| evidently that must be a pretty bad lot that you think a lot of the runoff water coming from that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11688)|
| 3:14:58| a steep lot or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11698)|
| 3:15:01| So how is he in compliance if we've got over $100,000 worth of damage done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11701)|
| 3:15:09| and why can't this lot 17 have something done with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11709)|
| 3:15:17| Part of the problem is that we actually went out and collected a bottle of water that was discolored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11717)|
| 3:15:25| and actually took it and sat it in our office and just let it sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11725)|
| 3:15:29| And it sat and it sat, and it never cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| I mean, what you've got, part of the problem out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| you've got these highly erodible soils that suspend in water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11735)|
| 3:15:39| and stay suspended for extended periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11739)|
| 3:15:43| So a developer can go in there and put in the necessary erosion control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11743)|
| 3:15:48| and looks great and still discolor that water going downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11748)|
| 3:15:53| And that's part of the problem we've been dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11753)|
| 3:15:56| The other part is that there was a time out there they weren't doing a very good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11756)|
| 3:16:00| and I think that's where the sedimentation of the creek took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11760)|
| 3:16:03| So you have that sedimentation of the creek that's already been deposited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11763)|
| 3:16:08| Since that time, plus at that time we've also added to the number of inspectors I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11768)|
| 3:16:14| so we're able to get to sites a little quicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11774)|
| 3:16:16| so we're able to get a little quicker turnaround and get compliance from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11776)|
| 3:16:20| I'm not familiar with lot number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11780)|
| 3:16:22| I don't know if I can answer your question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11782)|
| 3:16:24| But that's really the bulk of the problems is that when you go out there and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11784)|
| 3:16:28| there's not just one thing that grabs you and you say, well, there's the problem or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11788)|
| 3:16:31| It's a combination of the types of soils out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11791)|
| 3:16:35| It's just do not lend themselves to clearing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11795)|
| 3:16:38| And that's, I think, the majority of the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11798)|
| 3:16:41| plus the positive sediment in the stream that's already taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11801)|
| 3:16:46| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11806)|
| 3:16:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| I've said this before, Chris and Bruce and Laura,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11811)|
| 3:16:56| and I look through things through just a little different lens than my colleagues down there do at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11816)|
| 3:17:03| But I think here's one of the mismatches that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11823)|
| 3:17:09| I think we have an ordinance out there, and I think they're not in compliance with the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11829)|
| 3:17:13| and I think they're in violation of the ordinance, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11833)|
| 3:17:17| Now, let me tell you why I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11837)|
| 3:17:19| And I think Chris and I have had this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| I can come up and I can look at this big oak tree and I can go to Bruce and he says, you've got to have leather chaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11843)|
| 3:17:30| I buy the leather chaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| You've got to have gloves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11852)|
| 3:17:33| I buy the gloves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11853)|
| 3:17:34| You've got to have goggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11854)|
| 3:17:35| I buy the goggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11855)|
| 3:17:36| You've got to have a certain chainsaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| I buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11858)|
| 3:17:39| You've got to have a certain blade on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| I buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11861)|
| 3:17:42| You've got to cut it just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11862)|
| 3:17:43| I cut it just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11863)|
| 3:17:45| And the sucker falls on my neighbor's car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11865)|
| 3:17:47| Well, process-wise, I'm totally not out of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11867)|
| 3:17:51| But in the end of the ordinance, when you read the ordinance and it talks about flowage off and damage done, it's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11871)|
| 3:18:01| That tree's in the middle of Commissioner Norman's car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11881)|
| 3:18:05| So I'm not out of compliance, point, until the tree hit the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11885)|
| 3:18:12| And I think we need to look not just as process compliance but as product compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11892)|
| 3:18:18| I mean, we've had this discussion, not quite like the tree example, but I'm trying to get it where we can see that we can be 100% right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11898)|
| 3:18:26| And in the end, if you look at the big ordinance, the big ordinance says we can't let the tree hit the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11906)|
| 3:18:32| And we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11912)|
| 3:18:33| So we're in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11913)|
| 3:18:35| Even though I did everything right, I read the book right, I implemented it right, the tree's in the middle of Commissioner Norman's car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11915)|
| 3:18:43| And the ordinance says we're not allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11923)|
| 3:18:46| End of story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11926)|
| 3:18:47| Now, that's kind of where my windows are, and we talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11927)|
| 3:18:51| But I don't want us to lose that focus when we're dealing with Ms. Cole's situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| because I just get really kind of nervous when we say they're not out of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11935)|
| 3:19:01| because in the bitter end, I think they are and they need to be liable for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11941)|
| 3:19:05| But enough of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11945)|
| 3:19:07| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11949)|
| 3:19:11| First off, I think we've done all that we can do tonight for Ms. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11951)|
| 3:19:15| We've got some things working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| Second thing is we have been promised a workshop, and yet we've continued to try to discuss and bring up answers to the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11958)|
| 3:19:30| We've defined enough problems here tonight for at least two workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11970)|
| 3:19:35| So we've got the first one on the books ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11975)|
| 3:19:38| So I'll make a motion we move on and off this subject for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11978)|
| 3:19:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11985)|
| 3:19:46| Well, I don't see any more lights anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11986)|
| 3:19:49| Thank you, Ms. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11989)|
| 3:19:50| Bruce, you're going to get with the commission when you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11990)|
| 3:19:54| Thank you for hanging in there so late with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11994)|
| 3:19:57| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=11997)|
| 3:20:02| On page 20, number three, discussion regarding the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12002)|
| 3:20:08| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12008)|
| 3:20:09| Do we have a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| I thought Mr. Leuthold had made a motion before the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12012)|
| 3:20:17| We're going to do that anyway, but if you want to go ahead and vote on it, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12017)|
| 3:20:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12020)|
| 3:20:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12021)|
| 3:20:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12022)|
| 3:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12025)|
| 3:20:26| I was going to do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12026)|
| 3:20:30| And he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12030)|
| 3:20:31| Someone was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12031)|
| 3:20:35| We suspended the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12035)|
| 3:20:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12038)|
| 3:20:44| Discussion regarding the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12047)|
| 3:20:52| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12052)|
| 3:20:54| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12054)|
| 3:20:56| I'm lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12056)|
| 3:20:57| Item three, the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| Send the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12059)|
| 3:21:02| The ethics committee recently had its first evidentiary hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12062)|
| 3:21:06| And I was just curious, wanted a report from the deputy law director on just a brief report on the rules of the hearing procedures that they used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12066)|
| 3:21:16| And just kind of lots of times that you don't realize you have to be kind of in something or do something once to see how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12076)|
| 3:21:24| And just wondering if there was anything that we needed to pay special attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12084)|
| 3:21:30| I heard from one person on the ethics committee who was wondering if we could change the time that they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12090)|
| 3:21:38| And also would like to ask them at their next meeting to kind of review how that process went to see if they could make any suggestions on how they worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12098)|
| 3:21:54| When I was on the ethics committee, we voted the day and the time we were to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12114)|
| 3:21:59| So I'd say it would be up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12119)|
| 3:22:00| Isn't that correct, Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12120)|
| 3:22:03| He was on there with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12123)|
| 3:22:04| And they had the power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12124)|
| 3:22:06| I don't think the ethics committee come under us anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12126)|
| 3:22:12| They're not one of our standing committees, I've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12132)|
| 3:22:15| They're what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12135)|
| 3:22:16| The ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12136)|
| 3:22:18| What about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12138)|
| 3:22:19| They're not one of our standing committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12139)|
| 3:22:22| The ethics committee is a committee that was mandated by state law, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12142)|
| 3:22:28| Yeah, they don't come under commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12148)|
| 3:22:30| The only, I think I'm correct, is that there's nine members of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12150)|
| 3:22:35| One is a county commissioner, and the county commission appoints three citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12155)|
| 3:22:40| So we don't even have the complete input to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12160)|
| 3:22:43| The sheriff appoints some and the mayor appoints some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12163)|
| 3:22:46| So if this person wanted to change the date and time that the ethics committee met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12166)|
| 3:22:52| She would have to discuss that with the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12172)|
| 3:22:55| Even the make-up of that committee was approved by the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12175)|
| 3:22:58| We didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12178)|
| 3:23:00| They arrived at how they wanted the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12180)|
| 3:23:04| I think we approved what they asked for, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12184)|
| 3:23:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12187)|
| 3:23:08| We did do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12188)|
| 3:23:09| We voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12189)|
| 3:23:10| But they're the ones that arrived at the make-up, not county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12190)|
| 3:23:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12192)|
| 3:23:14| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12194)|
| 3:23:17| Question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12197)|
| 3:23:19| Are you comfortable with the fact that the ethics committee has voted to accept hearsay evidence in a hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12199)|
| 3:23:31| Commissioner, members of the commission, when I started looking at the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12211)|
| 3:23:35| I realized they had no rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12215)|
| 3:23:38| And there are precious little examples around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12218)|
| 3:23:41| So what I did put together was what I thought to be a defensible set of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12221)|
| 3:23:47| I then presented them to the committee for their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12227)|
| 3:23:49| And I think I ultimately sent them to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12229)|
| 3:23:52| However, during the discussion, I advised them that hearsay is not probably a good idea, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12232)|
| 3:24:01| But I, of course, left it up to their judgment as to whether or not they wanted to permit hearsay during the hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12241)|
| 3:24:06| And they voted pretty much unanimously to leave hearsay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12246)|
| 3:24:10| So I don't like it from an attorney's point of view, but that was the decision they rendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12250)|
| 3:24:18| I would just point out to my colleagues here that this is a quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12258)|
| 3:24:24| Anything that is said or presented as testimony before the ethics committee could be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12264)|
| 3:24:30| if it is sent on to the district attorney or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12270)|
| 3:24:33| Transcripts will be sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12273)|
| 3:24:36| I have an issue that if I'm sitting in front of someone and they are allowing hearsay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12276)|
| 3:24:43| and it is being presented as, quote, fact or, I mean, we all know politics and we know how things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12283)|
| 3:24:52| I have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| Because this ethics committee not only is going to do elected officials, but we also have employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12294)|
| 3:25:01| And so if we're going to allow hearsay, I just think we need to talk with somebody about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12301)|
| 3:25:10| I personally have issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12310)|
| 3:25:12| And so I understand that if the ethics committee voted almost unanimously to accept hearsay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12312)|
| 3:25:19| I just think that that needs to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12319)|
| 3:25:22| And so I would leave it up to you, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12322)|
| 3:25:25| I don't know if anybody else feels that way or not, but I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12325)|
| 3:25:28| And perhaps you bring it up at the next meeting, because to me hearsay is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12328)|
| 3:25:34| It's hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12334)|
| 3:25:35| And if we're not going to have facts and if we're not going to base these hearings on facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12335)|
| 3:25:40| then I just feel like that the ethics committee at some point is going to be challenged as far as its credibility is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12340)|
| 3:25:48| And so I know that it's just a body that recommends, but still I know that they view themselves as a quasi-judicial body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12348)|
| 3:25:55| and these things are going to be sent on to things like an attorney general and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12355)|
| 3:25:59| So with rules of procedure, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12359)|
| 3:26:04| I'm just throwing this out for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12364)|
| 3:26:08| It was a real problem from my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12368)|
| 3:26:12| I don't know how we could have done it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12372)|
| 3:26:15| One side had an attorney, another side didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12375)|
| 3:26:18| If you're going to deal with the hearsay thing, who decides that it's hearsay and who objects if one person has an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12378)|
| 3:26:26| and the other side doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12386)|
| 3:26:28| And who is the judge if you do object?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12388)|
| 3:26:31| And in thinking about it, another issue that we're getting into is the whole issue of attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12391)|
| 3:26:37| Is Knox County going to start needing to provide attorneys for people at these hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12397)|
| 3:26:42| Let's say that you start bringing in witnesses and the witnesses then determine that they want to have a lawyer representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12402)|
| 3:26:48| Again, this is a quasi-judicial body and these things are going to go to another level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12408)|
| 3:26:53| Are we going to be asked to provide attorneys for witnesses that come in, for example, to testify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12413)|
| 3:26:59| I mean, these are all issues now that are starting to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12419)|
| 3:27:02| I would think that if we're going to get into a situation where you have attorneys present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12422)|
| 3:27:07| that perhaps Mr. Stewart is not the one to chair that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12427)|
| 3:27:11| Perhaps we need to look at someone who has judge experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12431)|
| 3:27:17| who has no connection with government, who is just there to referee, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12437)|
| 3:27:21| so that we can get into these types of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12441)|
| 3:27:24| A Robert Murrayan comes to mind, not that he would do it, but he's an administrative law judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12444)|
| 3:27:29| who has just impeccable integrity and who could referee something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12449)|
| 3:27:34| So I just mention that to you because I think that these are issues that the Ethics Committee is going to have to start dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12454)|
| 3:27:39| if we're going to start getting into more and more of these kinds of hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12459)|
| 3:27:43| And it looks like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12463)|
| 3:27:46| And I guess it was, you know, I'll just speak frankly and I want you to know I'm not speaking for the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12466)|
| 3:27:53| I'm just speaking from my observations, is that the comments were made there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12473)|
| 3:27:58| especially when some of the people, I believe they call them the respondents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12478)|
| 3:28:04| these are the people that are accused of doing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12484)|
| 3:28:07| when they elected to exercise their Fifth Amendment rights, the comments were made that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12487)|
| 3:28:13| well, since we can't ask any questions, I guess we'll have to send it to the district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12493)|
| 3:28:18| And just, you know, saying nothing doesn't mean that you did something wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12498)|
| 3:28:22| or that something gets referred to the district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12502)|
| 3:28:27| So, you know, there were probably some issues about how it was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12507)|
| 3:28:33| but this was the, quote, the wisdom of the committee to handle it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12513)|
| 3:28:38| But I agree with you, there's a problem when one side has an attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12518)|
| 3:28:42| and particularly on this hearsay business, I mean, who objects and who decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12522)|
| 3:28:48| when there's no attorney there, there's no judge there, there's, you know, I think it's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12528)|
| 3:28:55| If I could, Mr. Chairman, members of the board, one thing we have to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12535)|
| 3:28:59| When the state promulgated the ethics policy, it was up to the county commission to adopt an ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12539)|
| 3:29:06| Now, the county commission elected to adopt the model policy that was promulgated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12546)|
| 3:29:11| by the county technical advisory service, CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12551)|
| 3:29:16| You weren't mandated to do so, but that was pretty much the sentiment across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12556)|
| 3:29:21| My point is, regardless of how it's constituted, you are empowered to adopt the code of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12561)|
| 3:29:28| Which implies, by law, you are empowered to modify the code of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12568)|
| 3:29:33| You may want to start by looking at the very code of ethics that establishes this entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12573)|
| 3:29:39| And as long as we don't go too far afield of the legislative intent, you could modify your code of ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12579)|
| 3:29:46| and you could include some safeguards or provisions, or you can delineate with greater specificity the manner in which hearings are conducted, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12586)|
| 3:29:55| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12595)|
| 3:29:58| I think that's all valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12598)|
| 3:30:01| You know what, I'm concerned that the ethics committee is getting turned into a way to try to punish someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12601)|
| 3:30:11| I mean, we have a case we're going to be hearing day after tomorrow where a case has already been referred to the attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12611)|
| 3:30:17| it's already been under consideration, and yet it's coming to the ethics committee to see if we want to put more oomph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12617)|
| 3:30:23| behind the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| I mean, there's a legal process that's going on right now, and I don't know what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12625)|
| 3:30:31| I mean, yeah, Mr. Attorney General, it's in your office right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12631)|
| 3:30:37| Yeah, we know you're considering it, but here it comes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12637)|
| 3:30:41| And I just don't think that's what we're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12641)|
| 3:30:47| Again, it wasn't the wisdom of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12647)|
| 3:30:50| That's just I'm speaking for myself and myself alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12650)|
| 3:30:54| And thank you for your service, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12654)|
| 3:30:57| I think Paul Pinkston got even with me on something here when he nominated me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12657)|
| 3:31:03| I should have been suspicious there was a reason that he knew he's been around a lot longer than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12663)|
| 3:31:08| So thanks, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12668)|
| 3:31:10| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12670)|
| 3:31:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12672)|
| 3:31:13| You know, I agree with Commissioner Hammond, and I think Commissioner Bridges did a good job of politely agreeing with him as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12673)|
| 3:31:23| in terms of where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12683)|
| 3:31:26| And I think our law director, assistant law director, whatever you want to call him, our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12686)|
| 3:31:34| kind of brought an interesting point up, and so I'm trying to figure out a way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12694)|
| 3:31:41| How can we take a look at what the roles and responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12701)|
| 3:31:47| accountabilities of the ethics committee is in terms of what we've been given from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12707)|
| 3:31:53| but with this new process, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12713)|
| 3:32:01| When we're looking at, you know, things that are already in the system, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12721)|
| 3:32:07| and I don't know, I'm just asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| Are we trying to strengthen a point when it goes to the attorney general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12729)|
| 3:32:14| Is the ethics committee, you know, trying to put an exclamation on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12734)|
| 3:32:18| And I don't think that's the charge that I feel comfortable with them doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12738)|
| 3:32:23| So what process can we go through to try to get their marching orders, I guess, in line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12743)|
| 3:32:33| You know, things like hearsay, obviously, if it goes in a document, you know, it carries weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12753)|
| 3:32:41| If a statement that comes, you know, I said John did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12761)|
| 3:32:47| and we're only recording that data without any preface on it or putting italicizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12767)|
| 3:32:56| this is, you know, hearsay information, it can be really damaging going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12776)|
| 3:33:01| So I guess my question is how do we start that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12781)|
| 3:33:06| Well, sir, I think several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12786)|
| 3:33:07| One, regarding the rules of procedure they're currently using for hearings, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12787)|
| 3:33:14| when I inherited the ethics committee, so to speak, I came to the stark realization there were no rules at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12794)|
| 3:33:20| There were no procedures, and they were about to go forward without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12800)|
| 3:33:23| So I put together a set of procedures for at least them to consider several weeks in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12803)|
| 3:33:28| I sent them out to the entire ethics committee and said you have no procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12808)|
| 3:33:32| Here's a set of proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12812)|
| 3:33:34| You can edit them, delete them, ignore them, but we need something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12814)|
| 3:33:39| And I say I because I've been in government for too many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12819)|
| 3:33:44| and it always annoyed me when people started talking in general terms like the office or the â€“ I personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12824)|
| 3:33:49| I mean, it falls on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12829)|
| 3:33:50| I made that decision, but my goal was to give them at least something to work from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12830)|
| 3:33:55| They pretty much, I think, adopted that which was given to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12835)|
| 3:33:58| In terms of the case that's coming up Wednesday, without getting into any specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12838)|
| 3:34:02| it is an oddity because the matter in question is being investigated by the state attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12842)|
| 3:34:09| The code, however, the adopted code that the commission adopted reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12849)|
| 3:34:15| refer the matter to the district attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12855)|
| 3:34:18| Now, I know that sounds very lawyer-like, but unfortunately under the state code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12858)|
| 3:34:23| and under state law there is a defined distinction between the state attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12863)|
| 3:34:28| and the local district attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12868)|
| 3:34:31| So that's the reason it can technically go to yet another â€“ go to the district attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12871)|
| 3:34:37| Now, I won't speak for the district attorney general, but normally when they get cases of the Zilk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12877)|
| 3:34:41| they boot them to the state attorney general where it already is, but I can't predict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12881)|
| 3:34:45| They may well say we're going to take it at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12885)|
| 3:34:49| We're going to refer it to a district attorney general in another district or go to the state AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12889)|
| 3:34:53| So I think you need to start with two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12893)|
| 3:34:55| One, I would take a look at your code of ethics that you adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12895)|
| 3:34:58| and two, the rules of procedure that were adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12898)|
| 3:35:01| I'd look at both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12901)|
| 3:35:04| So what kind of â€“ in terms of should we look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12904)|
| 3:35:08| I hate to have another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12908)|
| 3:35:13| But this is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12913)|
| 3:35:16| I think that we get an understanding first of what our role is in developing this rules of engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12916)|
| 3:35:24| and or the policy itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12924)|
| 3:35:28| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12928)|
| 3:35:29| So I think, and again, it will be up to me to start suggesting workshops to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12929)|
| 3:35:33| but this is not something that can be done in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12933)|
| 3:35:36| You can either have the commission doing it or the ethics committee doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12936)|
| 3:35:39| They've got to work, as the law says, in pairing material together to come up with a final solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12939)|
| 3:35:44| So you've got a fair system, one that's unsullied, one that survives any kind of legal challenge, due process, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12944)|
| 3:35:51| We learn to do by doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12951)|
| 3:35:53| We learn from our mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12953)|
| 3:35:56| So since he's already told us this thing is fixable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12956)|
| 3:36:01| then we do it as â€“ we fix it as we find these things until we get one that really works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12961)|
| 3:36:07| Will you finish, Commissioner Luto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12967)|
| 3:36:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12970)|
| 3:36:12| You know, I think we're starting to open up or the ethics committees open up a real Pandora's box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12972)|
| 3:36:17| and I'm not going to speak necessarily about what happened last week or what's going to happen this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12977)|
| 3:36:24| but when they start having hearings or meetings about possible felonious acts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12984)|
| 3:36:32| I think they've overstepped their bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12992)|
| 3:36:35| I think that they're going to very possibly may violate someone's due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=12995)|
| 3:36:42| And I'm still waiting for the state attorney general to come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13002)|
| 3:36:46| I can't use any of this evidence now because this person's due process rights have been violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13006)|
| 3:36:55| You've got to remember the state is what started this, and they got rid of their ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13015)|
| 3:37:01| They got rid of it, but they left it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13021)|
| 3:37:03| Now we still have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13023)|
| 3:37:06| And I just think, you know, just sort of a word out there to the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13026)|
| 3:37:13| maybe they need to reconsider what exactly they want to hear and what they don't want to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13033)|
| 3:37:19| because if, you know, we're going to get into â€“ we're going to start hiring attorneys for those who have been accused of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13039)|
| 3:37:26| and then have to turn around and have to hire attorneys for those that are doing the accusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13046)|
| 3:37:32| and we're getting into this, are they going to have hearsay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13052)|
| 3:37:35| What evidence are they going to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13055)|
| 3:37:37| Do we need to hire someone to come in and act as a judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13057)|
| 3:37:42| You know, like I said, we're opening a Pandora's box and we really need to sit down and decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13062)|
| 3:37:50| or the ethics committee needs to sit down and decide what is proper to be before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13070)|
| 3:37:56| And I don't know that something that could be a felony needs to be in front of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13076)|
| 3:38:01| That's something that needs to be investigated by the proper authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13081)|
| 3:38:06| and I don't think the ethics committee is really the right place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13086)|
| 3:38:10| Well, I think the deputy law director said that that's county commission's responsibility to adopt the code of ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13090)|
| 3:38:17| and it sounds like the rules of procedure also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13097)|
| 3:38:20| Yes, and we need to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13100)|
| 3:38:23| You've got to remember the also, if I may, and the code currently in place that it's adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13103)|
| 3:38:30| in section 8 lists a virtual panoply of laws that the committee could consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13110)|
| 3:38:36| and many of which are criminal laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13116)|
| 3:38:39| I mean, again, that's the model rule or the model code that CTAS thought was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13119)|
| 3:38:46| It's not law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13126)|
| 3:38:47| It's just what they suggested and people rightfully so deferred to it because there was nothing else out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13127)|
| 3:38:53| But presently the code lists various things like official misconduct, official oppression, misuse of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13133)|
| 3:39:00| ouster fee, conflict of interest, a virtual panoply of various laws that ostensibly would come before the committee at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13140)|
| 3:39:09| You know, it's one thing to have violated maybe a policy that we've established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13149)|
| 3:39:15| It's something else to have violated, you know, state law and it could be subject to jail time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13155)|
| 3:39:23| I mean, in what that may do down the road if something were to be referred to the state attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13163)|
| 3:39:31| and whether or not they have to maybe exclude possible evidence due to some violations of due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13171)|
| 3:39:39| I mean, I'm just thinking out loud here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13179)|
| 3:39:42| I just think it's a slippery slope that we've started down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13182)|
| 3:39:48| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13188)|
| 3:39:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13190)|
| 3:39:51| I'd like to remind everybody that we've always had an ethics committee even before the ethics committee was called your constituency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13191)|
| 3:39:59| I like to think that that was a very effective way to have an ethics committee, but we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13199)|
| 3:40:05| Given this line of argument, Mr. Jarrett, I was just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13205)|
| 3:40:09| is it in all of the warnings that we have, the things that we see that are possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13209)|
| 3:40:18| legal entanglements as well as other types of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13218)|
| 3:40:25| is it possible for us to hold the committee in abeyance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13225)|
| 3:40:32| or until the rules of procedure are outlined as it seems like many of the people here are interested in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13232)|
| 3:40:46| The law is silent on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13246)|
| 3:40:47| However, I think considering the fact that the interest here is to ensure the integrity of the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13247)|
| 3:40:54| and the due process, I'll defend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13254)|
| 3:40:57| And if somebody wants to raise that and take it to court, I'll dance with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13257)|
| 3:41:02| Sorry for the colloquialism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13262)|
| 3:41:04| It's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13264)|
| 3:41:05| My point is, you know, if we think we have a system right now that is not fully compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13265)|
| 3:41:12| or could possibly be violative of someone's due process rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13272)|
| 3:41:17| then we could suspend the hearings for a month or two until such time as we have it more definitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13277)|
| 3:41:25| That's the motion, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13285)|
| 3:41:27| I would like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| What's your motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13291)|
| 3:41:32| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13292)|
| 3:41:33| It's to suspend the activities of the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13293)|
| 3:41:38| until we have definition of these rules of procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13298)|
| 3:41:41| and we've reviewed some of the problems that have been discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13301)|
| 3:41:46| I mean, I would say you have one set for Wednesday, and I think that needs to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13306)|
| 3:41:52| But I think beyond that, you may want to go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13312)|
| 3:41:57| I would speak most strongly against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13317)|
| 3:42:00| State law requires us to have an ethics committee, not one in limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13320)|
| 3:42:05| There has to be a place where employees can take ethics violations when they occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13325)|
| 3:42:10| outside of the hot-button controversial ones we're dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13330)|
| 3:42:17| Yes, you can get into matters here and try to micromanage this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13337)|
| 3:42:22| But this committee adopted regulations on the advice of its law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13342)|
| 3:42:27| I was there, and I saw what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13347)|
| 3:42:30| There's a difference between ethics and law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13350)|
| 3:42:32| The Board of Law will decide whether there's any law violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13352)|
| 3:42:35| And this group was deciding whether there were questions of right or wrong violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13355)|
| 3:42:40| And I thought they proceeded admirably, and I think we're meddling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13360)|
| 3:42:47| I suppose that I disagree with Dr. Harmon in that the committee is obviously delving into affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13367)|
| 3:42:56| that are either criminal, should be reviewed by the attorney general or district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13376)|
| 3:43:03| And so I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13383)|
| 3:43:05| I think that given the way the committee is possibly being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13385)|
| 3:43:10| or potentially could be used to do harm to somebody for some kind of political vengeance or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13390)|
| 3:43:19| I'm very uncomfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13399)|
| 3:43:21| So we still have the motion before us with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13401)|
| 3:43:25| Just so we're clear, I think there's a distinction between not having any evidentiary hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13405)|
| 3:43:30| until you have a better set of procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| You don't want to be accused of suspending your ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13412)|
| 3:43:36| You know, you've got a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| They still should be able to receive complaints, et cetera, and even investigate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13418)|
| 3:43:43| I think what you want to hold in abeyance is any formal evidentiary hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13423)|
| 3:43:47| until you're comfortable with your rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13427)|
| 3:43:50| I think that's the safest position you should take or could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13430)|
| 3:43:55| Is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13435)|
| 3:43:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13436)|
| 3:43:57| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13437)|
| 3:43:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13438)|
| 3:43:59| Yeah, and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13439)|
| 3:44:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13441)|
| 3:44:02| Commissioner Wright, we're dealing with his motion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13442)|
| 3:44:09| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| We're dealing with his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13451)|
| 3:44:12| We're dealing with his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13452)|
| 3:44:14| And I'll speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13454)|
| 3:44:17| I want to make one statement first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13457)|
| 3:44:19| and I think that Mr. Jarrett did a very good job in trying to set up some procedures for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13459)|
| 3:44:24| and anything that I said before is not a criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13464)|
| 3:44:27| I have nothing but compliments for the way that that was conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13467)|
| 3:44:31| So I want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13471)|
| 3:44:33| You know, my only issue on this, I agree with what Commissioner Norman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13473)|
| 3:44:39| and I also agree with what Commissioner Herman said, is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13479)|
| 3:44:43| and I guess the question I have is do we have the authority to suspend their activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13483)|
| 3:44:48| Do we have the authority to do very much to the Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13488)|
| 3:44:52| There's nine members on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13492)|
| 3:44:55| We only have control of three of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13495)|
| 3:44:58| If we have the ability to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13498)|
| 3:45:01| then does the mayor have the ability to suspend the Ethics Committee because he has input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13501)|
| 3:45:05| Can the sheriff suspend the Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13505)|
| 3:45:08| I mean, we're just one little part of it that's not anywhere close to even being a significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13508)|
| 3:45:14| I mean, we're very much a minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13514)|
| 3:45:17| Apparently the commission are the ones who are responsible for setting the code of ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13517)|
| 3:45:23| which is what the committee derives its power from, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13523)|
| 3:45:27| We also approve the appointments, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13527)|
| 3:45:29| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| We approve three appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13531)|
| 3:45:32| There are six appointments we have no input into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13532)|
| 3:45:34| If you'd like, I'll read that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| The county commission appoints one commissioner for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13536)|
| 3:45:41| The sheriff appoints a member, an employee of the sheriff's department, for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13541)|
| 3:45:46| Then you have seven citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13546)|
| 3:45:49| Two of those citizens, I'm sorry, correction, three of those citizens are appointed by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13549)|
| 3:45:56| two citizens are appointed by the county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13556)|
| 3:45:58| and two citizens are appointed by the county Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13558)|
| 3:46:02| And some of those are for one-year terms, some of them for two-year terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13562)|
| 3:46:05| and some of them for three-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| So really the county commission has input into it, but we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13567)|
| 3:46:11| Into the makeup of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| but the commission are the ones who are responsible for the code of ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13573)|
| 3:46:17| and that is where the Ethics Committee derives its power is from the code of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13577)|
| 3:46:23| Am I right, Mr. Jarrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13585)|
| 3:46:26| I mean, the code of ethics is the rule and guide for the manner in which the committee conducts business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13586)|
| 3:46:31| That's why, just to reiterate that earlier caveat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13591)|
| 3:46:35| I don't think there is a motion to suspend the activities or suspend the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13595)|
| 3:46:41| You don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13601)|
| 3:46:42| The Ethics Committee continues in full force and effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13602)|
| 3:46:45| The only thing is because they're doing evidentiary hearings and those rules were not reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13605)|
| 3:46:54| and they were, you know, it's a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13614)|
| 3:46:58| I think the only safe thing you can do is say we want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13618)|
| 3:47:02| quickly convene a joint session, work out the rules of procedure, and then proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13622)|
| 3:47:06| But in the interim, they can still accept complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13626)|
| 3:47:09| There's still redress for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13629)|
| 3:47:10| There's still investigations up until a full-blown evidentiary hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13630)|
| 3:47:15| which you're merely holding in abeyance, which obviously this is something you'll want to do, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13635)|
| 3:47:20| with all deliberate speed in terms of moving together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13640)|
| 3:47:23| But you don't want to get into the position where you're presumed to suspend your committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13643)|
| 3:47:29| The only other comment that I have about that also is, there's probably other comments I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13649)|
| 3:47:36| but I just want to give some background to this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13656)|
| 3:47:42| There's four things that the Ethics Committee can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13662)|
| 3:47:45| They can refer a matter to the county attorney for a legal opinion or recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13665)|
| 3:47:50| In the case of an elected official, it can be referred to the county legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13670)|
| 3:47:55| for a possible public censure if the legislative body finds such action is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13675)|
| 3:48:01| In the case of an employee, you can refer the matter to the official responsible for supervision of the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13681)|
| 3:48:07| for possible disciplinary action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13687)|
| 3:48:10| And then the fourth thing is that in a case involving possible violation of state statutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13690)|
| 3:48:14| refer the matter to the district attorney for possible ouster or criminal prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13694)|
| 3:48:20| So the Ethics Committee certainly, according to the present policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13700)|
| 3:48:23| has the authority to refer a case to the district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13703)|
| 3:48:29| The only other thing, when we start meddling too much in the functioning of the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13709)|
| 3:48:35| is it certainly gives the appearance of potentially being self-serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13715)|
| 3:48:39| And there probably does need to be a certain degree of independence of the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13719)|
| 3:48:44| where everything they do doesn't have to be approved by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13724)|
| 3:48:52| We don't need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13732)|
| 3:48:57| Commissioner Hammond, you have something on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13737)|
| 3:48:59| Yes, I think, Mr. Chairman, with regards to that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13739)|
| 3:49:02| I would agree with our law director that we need to keep the committee functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13742)|
| 3:49:07| But with regards to the rules of procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13747)|
| 3:49:10| I'm wondering too if we could, as part of this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13750)|
| 3:49:15| request that the Ethics Committee gather legal minds together to put together a rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13755)|
| 3:49:22| People that have nothing to do with government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13762)|
| 3:49:24| but people who have everything to do with the law and proper procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13764)|
| 3:49:28| Mr. Armstrong, being an attorney, I would believe that there are retired people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13768)|
| 3:49:34| who have no access to grind with anybody who's very non-political,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13774)|
| 3:49:37| but yet who are very learned in how a procedure could be set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13777)|
| 3:49:41| And I'm just wondering if we could get three or four of these people together to review this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13781)|
| 3:49:48| work with our law director to come up with some suggestions to the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13788)|
| 3:49:52| on how to conduct an evidentiary hearing and how it would be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13792)|
| 3:49:55| Because I don't know how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13795)|
| 3:49:57| And I don't want to give the impression that I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13797)|
| 3:49:59| but I think that we do have people in our community that would be willing to step up and serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13799)|
| 3:50:03| who would give us an unbiased, just rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13803)|
| 3:50:08| I would recommend that we could have the law department contact the Knoxville Bar Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13808)|
| 3:50:13| and see if they could come up with some names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13813)|
| 3:50:15| That way we wouldn't even come up with the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13815)|
| 3:50:17| It would be totally neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13817)|
| 3:50:19| That would be a way to get some pro bono work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| I know the university has people that need pro bono work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13821)|
| 3:50:24| and we all need it at some point that may be able to review those for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13824)|
| 3:50:28| I think that would be a totally neutral thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13828)|
| 3:50:31| I'd like to add that as a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13831)|
| 3:50:33| that as part of it is that during this time period that the law department contact the Bar Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13833)|
| 3:50:39| and ask for three people with no ties to anybody to review these procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13839)|
| 3:50:43| and maybe make some suggestions to us on how we can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13843)|
| 3:50:47| I do know that when I was doing my research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13847)|
| 3:50:52| I contacted CTAS who promulgated this code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13852)|
| 3:50:56| and they never promulgated rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13856)|
| 3:50:59| They basically said that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13859)|
| 3:51:02| That's when I just put together that which I've used in the past in previous positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13862)|
| 3:51:08| and that's what I thought was the most legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13868)|
| 3:51:13| Commissioner Burroughs, do you have something on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13873)|
| 3:51:17| It seems that we have two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13877)|
| 3:51:19| One is the code of ethics, and one are the rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13879)|
| 3:51:24| So if we can put a three-person lawyer panel together to work on the rules of procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13884)|
| 3:51:31| I'd like to suggest that we form a joint group between the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13891)|
| 3:51:36| and some commissioners to review the code of ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13896)|
| 3:51:39| and make certain that it's serving us, make sure that it's exactly the way that we want it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13899)|
| 3:51:47| or if there's things in there that need to be reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13907)|
| 3:51:49| like should we have something in there that constitutes a felony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13909)|
| 3:51:54| or is that beyond what we think our ethics committee should be dealing with, as Craig was discussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13914)|
| 3:52:03| Maybe we could do five commissioners and five members of the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13923)|
| 3:52:07| and we could, of course, include Dr. Briggs because he wears both hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13927)|
| 3:52:13| He'll get two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13933)|
| 3:52:15| Commissioner Lambert, on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13935)|
| 3:52:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13939)|
| 3:52:20| I want to make two points, and then I'm going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13940)|
| 3:52:24| We have been here for nine hours, sitting in these seats with only very short bathroom breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13944)|
| 3:52:34| If we were Wal-Mart working our employees like this, it would be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13954)|
| 3:52:42| You can't work people with very short breaks without a full, and I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13962)|
| 3:52:49| And yucky food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13969)|
| 3:52:50| I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13970)|
| 3:52:51| I was going to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13971)|
| 3:52:52| It's really yucky food, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13972)|
| 3:52:54| I thought the donuts were great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| Plus the irony of having prisoners make donuts is kind of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13976)|
| 3:53:02| No, the point is there's a reason why labor laws are set up like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13982)|
| 3:53:06| It's because the quality of work that you get out of employees with this kind of schedule is not good quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13986)|
| 3:53:17| I don't think we pass very good legislation when we've been sitting here for nine hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=13997)|
| 3:53:24| We're tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14004)|
| 3:53:25| We're fatigued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14005)|
| 3:53:26| I'm not at 100% right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14006)|
| 3:53:27| I'm probably at about 40% brain function right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14007)|
| 3:53:32| We've just been sitting here too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14012)|
| 3:53:35| I also think that if we do anything to disrupt, and the cameras are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14015)|
| 3:53:42| Whether people are watching it right now or not really doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14022)|
| 3:53:45| They're going to watch it on the replay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14025)|
| 3:53:48| And if we do this now, and I'm going to mention the 500-pound elephants in the room, and they're both good friends of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14028)|
| 3:53:55| I'm certainly glad I'm not on that ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14035)|
| 3:53:58| But one of their own is about to go before the ethics committee Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14038)|
| 3:54:04| If we make this vote tonight, the perception of the public is going to be that we are trying to protect one of our own from the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14044)|
| 3:54:15| That we are taking sides with Mr. Smith over Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14055)|
| 3:54:21| And I'm certainly glad I don't have to take sides because I consider them both to be very good friends of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14061)|
| 3:54:28| So the substitute motion I'm going to make is that we defer this and put it on the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14068)|
| 3:54:34| Let's deal with it when our minds are fresh and when we're sharp and when we can do our best work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14074)|
| 3:54:42| And let's defer this for 30 days so that the perception is not that we are trying to protect Mr. Smith from Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14082)|
| 3:54:55| So my substitute motion is that we defer this until next month and let's deal with it when we're sharp and when this conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14095)|
| 3:55:04| where one of our own members is about to be facing this ethics committee, when that conflict of interest has been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14104)|
| 3:55:11| So my motion is that we defer this until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14111)|
| 3:55:15| Lumpy, Joe suggested that we not include Wednesday's meeting in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14115)|
| 3:55:19| Right. It's already been decided, Lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14119)|
| 3:55:22| I still think we need to wait and talk and we need to discuss this again when we're sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14122)|
| 3:55:28| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14128)|
| 3:55:31| That might mean never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14131)|
| 3:55:35| Well, now, Mark, I said I'm firing on 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14135)|
| 3:55:38| I can still take you with half my brains tied behind my back just to make it fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14138)|
| 3:55:43| I'd be careful of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14143)|
| 3:55:45| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14145)|
| 3:55:48| Say all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14148)|
| 3:55:50| I hope he buys you lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14150)|
| 3:55:58| If we do, I'll sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14158)|
| 3:56:02| Commissioner Burroughs, do you have something on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14162)|
| 3:56:08| We have a substitute motion to defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14168)|
| 3:56:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14171)|

| 3:56:56| I think I need to recuse myself because I picked some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14216)|

| 3:58:26| The pass wishes to stay as a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14306)|
| 3:58:35| Just trying to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14315)|
| 3:58:38| I thought the yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14318)|
| 3:58:40| Five yes, ten no, one pass, and three recuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14320)|
| 3:58:47| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14327)|
| 3:58:51| Five yes, ten no, one pass, and three recuse themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14331)|
| 3:58:58| Back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14338)|
| 3:59:02| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14342)|
| 3:59:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14344)|
| 3:59:07| I feel that this item just doesn't need to be before us at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14347)|
| 3:59:13| And I'm going to pass on this next vote as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14353)|
| 3:59:20| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14360)|
| 3:59:22| A clarification on the motion, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14362)|
| 3:59:24| I was getting ready to say the same question here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14364)|
| 3:59:28| I had asked for a friendly amendment that the Bar Association be contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14368)|
| 3:59:32| and have a three-person panel to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14372)|
| 3:59:34| and make recommendations with regards to the rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14374)|
| 3:59:38| Whoever made the motion would accept that friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14378)|
| 3:59:40| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14380)|
| 3:59:41| I accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14381)|
| 3:59:42| Second the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14382)|
| 3:59:43| Could you repeat the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14383)|
| 3:59:46| Mr. Jarrett, will you help me with the motion so everyone can be clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14386)|
| 3:59:54| It's my understanding we can't even remember what we're voting on, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14394)|
| 3:59:57| I can quite clearly, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14397)|
| 4:00:01| Just to show you, I think we're voting to suspend evidentiary hearings in the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14401)|
| 4:00:10| and in the interim to request that the Bar Association be contacted to assist with forming a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14410)|
| 4:00:21| to look at the rules of procedure of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14421)|
| 4:00:23| Is that approximately right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14423)|
| 4:00:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14425)|
| 4:00:26| After Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14426)|
| 4:00:27| After Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14427)|
| 4:00:29| I also thought likewise there was going to be a joint committee with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14429)|
| 4:00:34| and the ethics committee to look at the overall process and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14434)|
| 4:00:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14438)|
| 4:00:40| That's the motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14440)|
| 4:00:43| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14443)|
| 4:00:44| Wednesday's meeting proceeds as scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14444)|
| 4:00:46| All other functions of the ethics committee in terms of them receiving complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14446)|
| 4:00:50| investigating complaints, et cetera, everyone in the county still has complete opportunities to redress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14450)|
| 4:00:57| There just won't be any evidentiary hearings until such time as we're sure that the rules are effectively promulgated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14457)|
| 4:01:03| and defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14463)|
| 4:01:05| Just the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14465)|
| 4:01:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14467)|
| 4:01:09| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14469)|
| 4:01:11| I am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14471)|
| 4:01:12| I am not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14472)|
| 4:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14473)|
| 4:01:14| I am not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14474)|
| 4:01:15| So I guess I have a point of order clarification, but I'll yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14475)|
| 4:01:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14480)|
| 4:01:21| And that is, I guess I'm asking for Commissioner Briggs, in terms of recusal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14481)|
| 4:01:27| I guess I have a question to the law director whether you think that is a valid or wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14487)|
| 4:01:37| or whatever adjective you want to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14497)|
| 4:01:40| It seemed to me he had some consternation about whether he is to recuse himself or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14500)|
| 4:01:45| I would think he doesn't have to in that he's a sitting member on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14505)|
| 4:01:50| and he's a voting member on this body who happens to be our designee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14510)|
| 4:01:54| Well, you normally recuse yourself if you have a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14514)|
| 4:01:57| or the manner in which you're voting on inures to your professional or personal benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14517)|
| 4:02:03| But, you know, if the commissioner feels that he's not comfortable with the vote, he can certainly recuse himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14523)|
| 4:02:08| I don't think he's required to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14528)|
| 4:02:11| Because, again, there's no personal benefit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14531)|
| 4:02:14| You know, I guess the only thing is that I'm also a member of the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14534)|
| 4:02:18| and it's sort of like when Commissioner Saunders and the others were defending maybe the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14538)|
| 4:02:28| The only difference is the audit committee is part of the commission and this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14548)|
| 4:02:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14555)|
| 4:02:37| I didn't think about it until somebody else brought up what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14557)|
| 4:02:46| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14566)|
| 4:02:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14568)|
| 4:02:49| Sort of looking a little bit at Dr. Briggs' dilemma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14569)|
| 4:02:55| all activity in Knox County takes place by our ordinance or resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14575)|
| 4:03:04| To give up your right to participate on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14584)|
| 4:03:09| does that mean that I shouldn't vote on anything that occurs in the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14589)|
| 4:03:14| because I'm a member of the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14594)|
| 4:03:16| Or if we were still on the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14596)|
| 4:03:19| that we couldn't discuss Board of Zoning Appeals items here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14599)|
| 4:03:26| Because I think that the Board of Zoning Appeals is operated by resolution or ordinance established by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14606)|
| 4:03:34| So I think that Dr. Briggs, I think that Commissioner Briggs has a perfect right to cast a vote as a member of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14614)|
| 4:03:43| on this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14623)|
| 4:03:52| The thing that bothers me, I guess, is I have a question about the Wednesday deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14632)|
| 4:03:59| If we're not going to deal with evidentiary hearings from this evening ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14639)|
| 4:04:10| then we're not really dealing with evidentiary hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14650)|
| 4:04:14| It is by resolution or ordinance that everything takes place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14654)|
| 4:04:20| So we either pass something tonight that deals with protecting us going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14660)|
| 4:04:27| or there's no need to do anything tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14667)|
| 4:04:37| Is there still any uncertainty on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14677)|
| 4:04:42| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14682)|
| 4:04:44| Are we suspending evidentiary hearings from this point forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14684)|
| 4:04:53| allowing the ethics committee to still be a report-receiving entity and deal with everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14693)|
| 4:05:00| Are we dealing with evidentiary hearings after Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14700)|
| 4:05:06| It's after Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14706)|
| 4:05:07| After Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14707)|
| 4:05:08| That's what the motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14708)|
| 4:05:10| And, again, give me the logic of why we're not dealing with evidentiary hearing on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14710)|
| 4:05:15| If we think that that situation is flawed, why are we not dealing with it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14715)|
| 4:05:22| I didn't make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14722)|
| 4:05:24| That's why I'm raising the question about this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14724)|
| 4:05:27| I made the motion, but I fully agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14727)|
| 4:05:29| I don't know why Wednesday would be excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14729)|
| 4:05:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14732)|
| 4:05:33| And that's the way I heard your motion, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14733)|
| 4:05:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14735)|
| 4:05:36| I didn't intend to exclude Wednesday in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14736)|
| 4:05:38| It was much more comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14738)|
| 4:05:40| Was it because there was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14740)|
| 4:05:42| A clerk said it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14742)|
| 4:05:44| A clerk said it's not what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14744)|
| 4:05:46| It's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14746)|
| 4:05:47| It wasn't a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14747)|
| 4:05:49| I thought it was because there was some concern that there might be the perception that we were acting to protect one of our fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14749)|
| 4:06:01| But I don't know if that was made a part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14761)|
| 4:06:05| That was not made a part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| Did you accept it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14767)|
| 4:06:08| I believe that was made as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14768)|
| 4:06:11| I'm not sure who made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14771)|
| 4:06:13| I thought it was, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14773)|
| 4:06:14| But it was a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14774)|
| 4:06:15| I distinctively remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14775)|
| 4:06:17| I think it was part of the discussion that our law director was having about Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14777)|
| 4:06:22| Oh, he said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14782)|
| 4:06:23| It's only a friendly amendment if the maker of the motion and the second agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14783)|
| 4:06:28| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14788)|
| 4:06:29| I believe the maker of the motion accepted it, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14789)|
| 4:06:31| Did the maker of the motion, which would be Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14791)|
| 4:06:34| I'm really starting to believe that everybody is tired and no one knows who said what, when, and who's on third or fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14794)|
| 4:06:42| And that's why I say it's not properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14802)|
| 4:06:47| Well, let's clearly state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14807)|
| 4:06:49| I'm going to leave the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14809)|
| 4:06:50| Y'all do what you want to, so there's no pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14810)|
| 4:06:53| Y'all do what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14813)|
| 4:06:55| There's no pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14815)|
| 4:06:57| To be quite honest, I didn't know what the Wednesday dinner looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14817)|
| 4:07:01| I like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14821)|
| 4:07:03| Can we have a do-over on this, Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14823)|
| 4:07:07| Can we restate this motion with the elements that you feel are sane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14827)|
| 4:07:11| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14831)|
| 4:07:12| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14832)|
| 4:07:13| With including Wednesday with the processes to exclude or ask the Ethics Committee to exclude evidentiary hearing material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14833)|
| 4:07:30| And then, as I understood it, Mr. Hammond's friendly amendment was dealing with the panel to review the rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14850)|
| 4:07:43| My friendly amendment was the committee made up of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14863)|
| 4:07:50| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14870)|
| 4:07:53| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14873)|
| 4:08:01| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14881)|
| 4:08:02| How many friendly amendments are we allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14882)|
| 4:08:06| My understanding is that we had one for three members of the Bar Association to work on rules and procedures for the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14886)|
| 4:08:16| And then a committee made up of five commissioners, five members of the Ethics Committee to go over the Code of Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14896)|
| 4:08:24| That was a rhetorical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14904)|
| 4:08:26| I want to make another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14906)|
| 4:08:27| But we revisited deferring this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14907)|
| 4:08:31| That's been voted on and voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14911)|
| 4:08:34| You can't have another substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14914)|
| 4:08:36| He was on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14916)|
| 4:08:38| You can't have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14918)|
| 4:08:40| He can make the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14920)|
| 4:08:45| If you're on the prevailing side, according to Robert's rules of order, you can bring the motion to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14925)|
| 4:08:51| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14931)|
| 4:08:53| I've got a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14933)|
| 4:08:55| This whole motion, it was not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14935)|
| 4:08:59| And I'm going to object to it being on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14939)|
| 4:09:01| And it takes a two-thirds vote to add it to the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14941)|
| 4:09:06| Well, I think the rule is that when we started this discussion that we could make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14946)|
| 4:09:13| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14953)|
| 4:09:14| I'm going to ask that the Law Director opine on whether or not this is a motion that would be considered in addition to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14954)|
| 4:09:26| Because it's going to be in resolution form, that would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14966)|
| 4:09:32| Because it's ultimately going to be a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14972)|
| 4:09:34| You need a second on that, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14974)|
| 4:09:38| I think our rules are if any member of commission objects to an item being added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14978)|
| 4:09:46| then it does take a two-thirds vote to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14986)|
| 4:09:49| And I've said all along, I don't think this is proper to be trying to tell, I think, an entity outside of us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=14989)|
| 4:10:00| And I'm just going to object to it being added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15000)|
| 4:10:03| I agree with you 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15003)|
| 4:10:05| We're not telling them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15005)|
| 4:10:08| We're telling them to stop whatever procedures they've already adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15008)|
| 4:10:13| Which we find faulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15013)|
| 4:10:15| And I find fault in them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15015)|
| 4:10:16| Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15016)|
| 4:10:18| Mr. Law Director, can you chime in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15018)|
| 4:10:24| Your agenda reads in paragraph six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15024)|
| 4:10:27| Matters may be added to the agenda for all meetings except a special called meeting by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15027)|
| 4:10:33| of the commission or two-thirds of a quorum of a committee as applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15033)|
| 4:10:38| You are considering ultimately which would be a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15038)|
| 4:10:41| So this would probably require a two-thirds vote to get it before the commissioner properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15041)|
| 4:10:50| Well, let me say this, because I don't particularly want to deal with this either tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15050)|
| 4:10:59| But when we started the discussion phase of the agenda, didn't we say a motion can come out of the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15059)|
| 4:11:08| When we set the rules for this particular piece of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15068)|
| 4:11:15| If we have a discussion item, that we could have a motion come out of the discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15075)|
| 4:11:20| We have had motions come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15080)|
| 4:11:21| We did in the previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15081)|
| 4:11:22| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15082)|
| 4:11:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15083)|
| 4:11:24| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15084)|
| 4:11:25| Nobody objected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15085)|
| 4:11:26| And no one has ever objected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15086)|
| 4:11:27| I'm objecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15087)|
| 4:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15088)|
| 4:11:31| Mr. Law Director, we need a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15091)|
| 4:11:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15094)|
| 4:11:35| So I'll make it a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15095)|
| 4:11:38| I'll make a motion that we add this to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15098)|
| 4:11:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15100)|
| 4:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15101)|
| 4:11:42| Roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15102)|
| 4:11:44| I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15104)|
| 4:11:46| Dr. Briggs, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15106)|
| 4:11:49| I just want to make another comment, is that we're voting that we object to the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15109)|
| 4:11:54| And I dare say that no one here on the commission that would be voting other than me even know what those procedures are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15114)|
| 4:12:01| There's no one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15121)|
| 4:12:02| Maybe you read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15122)|
| 4:12:04| And I was there at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15124)|
| 4:12:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15126)|
| 4:12:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15127)|
| 4:12:08| Did you actually get a copy and read them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15128)|
| 4:12:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15130)|
| 4:12:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15131)|
| 4:12:13| But we're hearing recommendations by the law director on rules of entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15133)|
| 4:12:18| And the other thing is I think if we're going to be voting on a resolution that affects members of another committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15138)|
| 4:12:26| and it wasn't on our agenda, is that there should be people from that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15146)|
| 4:12:31| the chairman or other members of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15151)|
| 4:12:33| would have the opportunity to get up and to speak about what they thought about the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15153)|
| 4:12:39| I know there's some questions about whether due process, and let me tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15159)|
| 4:12:43| there were a lot of things I didn't like about the way that came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15163)|
| 4:12:46| But on the advice of the attorneys, of the respondents, is you can't say anything that could incriminate yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15166)|
| 4:12:57| because they didn't say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15177)|
| 4:12:59| There was not one word said by a single respondent on the advice of their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15179)|
| 4:13:05| So as far as having due process or anything else, I mean, there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15185)|
| 4:13:12| I mean, this got sent to the district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15192)|
| 4:13:15| There's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15195)|
| 4:13:17| And I don't think that any district attorney or any judge or whoever is going to be reviewing this that sees the transcript| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15197)|
| 4:13:24| or sees some of the hearsay or some of the, I'm even going to call it the illogic in the discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15204)|
| 4:13:32| would say that they would take that into account on whether this needed to be prosecuted as a felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15212)|
| 4:13:43| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| I'm going to suggest that rather than voting on this tonight, and I'll ask Mr. Norman to consider this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15225)|
| 4:13:53| is that we ask that the ethics committee meet with us next month to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15233)|
| 4:13:59| I haven't seen the procedure, but I know about the hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15239)|
| 4:14:02| That one thing just bothers me like nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15242)|
| 4:14:05| There were other things too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15245)|
| 4:14:07| Yeah, and there are other things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15247)|
| 4:14:08| I really believe that we should have an independent body who are skilled in this to look at these procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15248)|
| 4:14:14| and make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15254)|
| 4:14:15| I see nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15255)|
| 4:14:16| I think to make a recommendation to the ethics committee would be very proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15256)|
| 4:14:19| I think it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15259)|
| 4:14:21| But I don't think we're going to get two-thirds votes to not get it on the agenda is the reason I'm saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15261)|
| 4:14:26| But if we make a statement of intent that we want to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15266)|
| 4:14:29| and I think we're sending a message to the ethics committee, we're concerned about these rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15269)|
| 4:14:34| Let's get it right and let's get together and figure out how we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15274)|
| 4:14:38| Commissioner Norman, I mean, if you want to go ahead and do a vote up and down, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15278)|
| 4:14:42| No, I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15282)|
| 4:14:43| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15283)|
| 4:14:44| I mean, I agree with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15284)|
| 4:14:47| And it is very late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15287)|
| 4:14:49| We're very tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15289)|
| 4:14:50| And as long as they get the message, are they getting the message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15290)|
| 4:14:55| if they get the message, I'm fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15295)|
| 4:14:59| We can go ahead and put it on the agenda for next month, Mr. Chairman, during the discussion phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15299)|
| 4:15:04| So you are withdrawing your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15304)|
| 4:15:08| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15308)|
| 4:15:13| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15313)|
| 4:15:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15314)|
| 4:15:15| I just agree with my two colleagues here from the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15315)|
| 4:15:18| I just think that before we start telling another committee what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15318)|
| 4:15:23| I think they should have a chance to be here to defend themselves and say why they're doing what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15323)|
| 4:15:28| and to hear the entire argument on both sides as to what we need to go from that next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15328)|
| 4:15:36| And that was my objection, and that was my only objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15336)|
| 4:15:42| I do believe there's some flaws there, and we do need to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15342)|
| 4:15:46| but I just didn't think now was the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15346)|
| 4:15:52| You withdrew your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15352)|
| 4:15:55| He withdrew his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15355)|
| 4:15:58| He's withdrawing his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15358)|
| 4:15:59| He's withdrawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15359)|
| 4:16:01| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15361)|
| 4:16:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15362)|
| 4:16:03| There's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15363)|
| 4:16:04| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15364)|
| 4:16:05| We're just going to have it on as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15365)|
| 4:16:07| The motion was to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15367)|
| 4:16:09| He withdrew his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15369)|
| 4:16:11| If he withdraws his motion, then I don't have anything to object to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15371)|
| 4:16:15| He didn't make it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15375)|
| 4:16:16| No, I haven't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15376)|
| 4:16:17| I've just said let's have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15377)|
| 4:16:20| for a resolution next month to go ahead and form a committee to make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15380)|
| 4:16:23| and invite them to come and be a part of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15383)|
| 4:16:25| But as far as doing something tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15385)|
| 4:16:28| I would recommend that whatever a commissioner wants to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15388)|
| 4:16:32| to go ahead and put it on the agenda as a resolution form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15392)|
| 4:16:36| so that we know exactly what your intent is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15396)|
| 4:16:41| and the ethics committee will know what that intent is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15401)|
| 4:16:46| and they would be prepared to talk to us at our committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15406)|
| 4:16:51| and at the full commission next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15411)|
| 4:16:57| Just to make sure that the record is clear, the second reluctantly agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15417)|
| 4:17:05| You don't have anything to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15425)|
| 4:17:09| The last thing, discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15429)|
| 4:17:13| We have one more and we're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15433)|
| 4:17:25| Are we doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15445)|
| 4:17:28| Okay, we need to withdraw number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15448)|
| 4:17:30| Go ahead and read it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15450)|
| 4:17:34| Discussion regarding returning the internal auditor's budget to the internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15454)|
| 4:17:39| and placing the internal audit department back under county commission authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15459)|
| 4:17:44| And we've already taken care of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15464)|
| 4:17:46| We took care of it under the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15466)|
| 4:17:49| Now this is the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15469)|
| 4:17:50| We need to withdraw the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15470)|
| 4:17:52| No, no ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15472)|
| 4:17:54| Oh, that's a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15474)|
| 4:17:55| That's just a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15475)|
| 4:18:00| Can we move this to next month and let me put it on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15480)|
| 4:18:04| She has to have it for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15484)|
| 4:18:08| Motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15488)|
| 4:18:16| We voted to move the budget back but not to put him back under commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15496)|
| 4:18:22| We did that on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15502)|
| 4:18:24| She says she needs it for my minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15504)|
| 4:18:28| I make a motion we withdraw item number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15508)|
| 4:18:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15511)|
| 4:18:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15513)|
| 4:18:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15514)|
| 4:18:35| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15515)|
| 4:18:36| It's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15516)|
| 4:18:37| Discussion regarding Knox County's fiscal year 2008-2009 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15517)|
| 4:18:43| I'd like to withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15523)|
| 4:18:44| The finance director said he would get us all letters showing us how this money was paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15524)|
| 4:18:49| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15529)|
| 4:18:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15530)|
| 4:18:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15531)|
| 4:18:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15532)|
| 4:18:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15533)|
| 4:18:54| We have Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15534)|
| 4:18:56| I'd like to trade in my sunshine talk before 8 o'clock and withdraw a booms day request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15536)|
| 4:19:06| I believe some of us have received invitations to the Mabry-Hazen House to do booms day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15546)|
| 4:19:14| which the tickets valued, the fundraising ticket is valued at $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15554)|
| 4:19:21| Part of that being fundraising, where is the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15561)|
| 4:19:27| I've sort of preliminarily asked this question, and is it proper for us to do $15 worth of copay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15567)|
| 4:19:43| I asked that of the law director about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15583)|
| 4:19:49| and what he said it comes down to on these charity events is it comes down to the value of the meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15589)|
| 4:19:56| not what they sell the tickets for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15596)|
| 4:19:58| So I think that's what Bill said about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15598)|
| 4:20:03| Is that not correct, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15603)|
| 4:20:07| Well, your code does read that it has to be under $35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15607)|
| 4:20:11| and that basically reads meals and entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15611)|
| 4:20:17| I guess I need to understand more specifically what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15617)|
| 4:20:21| People are giving out free tickets to commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15621)|
| 4:20:25| It was two $50 tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15625)|
| 4:20:28| For a normal person to attend, it would be a $50 donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15628)|
| 4:20:31| And so what I was told on Legacy Parks was if it costs $75 for a normal person to get in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15631)|
| 4:20:37| you've got to dock it down, you've got to pay the difference between the $35 and the $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15637)|
| 4:20:41| And I view that to be in conflict with what we've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15641)|
| 4:20:45| See, now I was told that if you went to a charity, like if I'm going to speak at an event or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15645)|
| 4:20:52| and I go to a charity and they're charging $100 a plate because it's a fundraiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15652)|
| 4:21:01| it comes down to the value of the meal itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15661)|
| 4:21:04| and not necessarily what they're selling tickets for because it's a charity event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15664)|
| 4:21:08| And that's what I've been operating under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15668)|
| 4:21:10| and I'm sure I've been to a lot of these things that I'm not sure what they charge for each of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15670)|
| 4:21:15| but I'm sure that I've been to some that may have sold for more than $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15675)|
| 4:21:20| It's because there's a part that's tax deductible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15680)|
| 4:21:23| Like this Friday, Sir Thomas having their thing, it's $75 a ticket, but $45 of that $75 is tax deductible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15683)|
| 4:21:33| But it was a long time ago that I asked because I was real concerned about that from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15693)|
| 4:21:41| And I'm not sure if it was Bill or if it was John Owings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15701)|
| 4:21:46| but what I was told was that it was the value of the meal, not what the tickets cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15706)|
| 4:21:51| I've been told the same thing, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15711)|
| 4:21:54| Meeting's adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15714)|
| 4:21:56| Don't forget we have a meeting on Tuesday at 8 o'clock for reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090824part2?start=15716)|
