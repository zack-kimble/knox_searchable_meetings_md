| 5:58:26| the old rubber hose counter or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21506)|
| 5:58:28| something or a weighted thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21508)|
| 5:58:30| in the floor and there's a display| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21510)|
| 5:58:32| as you enter saying ten spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21512)|
| 5:58:34| left or it lights up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21514)|
| 5:58:36| Try the Smith Street garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21516)|
| 5:58:38| or whatever. In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21518)|
| 5:58:40| tells you not to go in. I don't know if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21520)|
| 5:58:42| technology's around, but it'd be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21522)|
| 5:58:44| if you were just coming in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21524)|
| 5:58:46| nah, go someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21526)|
| 5:58:48| Well, the simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21528)|
| 5:58:50| counters are fairly simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21530)|
| 5:58:52| but when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21532)|
| 5:58:54| you've got multiple entrances and exits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21534)|
| 5:58:56| and such, it does get more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21536)|
| 5:58:58| And to be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21538)|
| 5:59:00| I'm thinking a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21540)|
| 5:59:02| maybe beyond that in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21542)|
| 5:59:04| there are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21544)|
| 5:59:06| cities that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21546)|
| 5:59:08| commercial private sector have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21548)|
| 5:59:10| apps where you can get on your phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21550)|
| 5:59:12| and it'll tell you not only where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21552)|
| 5:59:14| most of the apps right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21554)|
| 5:59:16| that even have Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21556)|
| 5:59:18| on them will tell you where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21558)|
| 5:59:20| the garage is, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21560)|
| 5:59:22| It doesn't tell you if it's full or empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21562)|
| 5:59:24| It doesn't tell you what it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21564)|
| 5:59:26| Whereas in larger metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21566)|
| 5:59:28| areas, there are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21568)|
| 5:59:30| free available apps that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21570)|
| 5:59:32| will not only tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21572)|
| 5:59:34| where parking is actually available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21574)|
| 5:59:36| tell you exactly what it'll cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21576)|
| 5:59:38| you per hour or per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21578)|
| 5:59:40| And so my goal, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21580)|
| 5:59:42| is to get us all the way till| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21582)|
| 5:59:44| 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21584)|
| 5:59:46| not stuck back in the early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21586)|
| 5:59:48| 90s with the technology we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21588)|
| 5:59:50| using. And it'll take a while to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21590)|
| 5:59:52| there. Obviously, there's some expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21592)|
| 5:59:54| but there are already a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21594)|
| 5:59:56| cities that have sensors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21596)|
| 5:59:58| on their parking meters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21598)|
| 6:00:00| or on the pavement for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21600)|
| 6:00:02| every on-street lot. You can pull an app| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21602)|
| 6:00:04| up that'll show you exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21604)|
| 6:00:06| what parking spots are available on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21606)|
| 6:00:08| Union Avenue like right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21608)|
| 6:00:10| And so I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21610)|
| 6:00:12| to see us on your behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21612)|
| 6:00:14| migrate to that kind of system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21614)|
| 6:00:16| where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21616)|
| 6:00:18| stop talking about there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21618)|
| 6:00:20| parking in downtown Knoxville because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21620)|
| 6:00:22| there almost always is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21622)|
| 6:00:24| But you have to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21624)|
| 6:00:26| the town to get there, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21626)|
| 6:00:28| The second question, or last question I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21628)|
| 6:00:30| is, is there any way you could squeeze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21630)|
| 6:00:32| into your budget some kind of a shade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21632)|
| 6:00:34| that covers those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21634)|
| 6:00:36| skylights when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21636)|
| 6:00:38| have a midday meeting and someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21638)|
| 6:00:40| tries to project on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21640)|
| 6:00:42| there, all you see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21642)|
| 6:00:44| white reflection and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21644)|
| 6:00:46| no visibility from the audience. And I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21646)|
| 6:00:48| know how you do that, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21648)|
| 6:00:50| Grandma would have lowered the shades or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21650)|
| 6:00:52| Actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21652)|
| 6:00:54| I've asked my folks to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21654)|
| 6:00:56| tinting, some type of tinting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21656)|
| 6:00:58| that we could put on those because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21658)|
| 6:01:00| you probably won't remember, but if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21660)|
| 6:01:02| look straight up behind you three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21662)|
| 6:01:04| ago, you would have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21664)|
| 6:01:06| that cheesy, corrugated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21666)|
| 6:01:08| fiberglass that was being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21668)|
| 6:01:10| for exactly that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21670)|
| 6:01:12| And when we re-lit the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21672)|
| 6:01:14| we got rid of that. But for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21674)|
| 6:01:16| daytime meetings, it is a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21676)|
| 6:01:18| bright. And the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21678)|
| 6:01:20| Commission has the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21680)|
| 6:01:22| issue because they typically meet in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21682)|
| 6:01:24| afternoon, not night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21684)|
| 6:01:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21686)|
| 6:01:28| When was the last time a comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21688)|
| 6:01:30| parking study of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21690)|
| 6:01:32| was conducted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21692)|
| 6:01:34| Including all the garages and parking on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21694)|
| 6:01:36| and this sort of thing. Has that been done recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21696)|
| 6:01:38| It's my understanding that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21698)|
| 6:01:40| one in process, but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21700)|
| 6:01:42| defer to Jim or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21702)|
| 6:01:44| Eddie on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21704)|
| 6:01:46| We did ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21706)|
| 6:01:48| MTAS to do a parking study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21708)|
| 6:01:50| for us, and we just finished the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21710)|
| 6:01:52| They presented it to the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21712)|
| 6:01:54| Well, they have not been presented to the Mayor yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21714)|
| 6:01:56| But they have presented it to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21716)|
| 6:01:58| and they will present it to the Mayor probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21718)|
| 6:02:00| within the next couple of weeks, so we will have that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21720)|
| 6:02:02| That's garages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21722)|
| 6:02:04| It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21724)|
| 6:02:06| garages. I think it's primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21726)|
| 6:02:08| on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21728)|
| 6:02:10| Metered and free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21730)|
| 6:02:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21732)|
| 6:02:14| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21734)|
| 6:02:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21736)|
| 6:02:18| Dale, do you have in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21738)|
| 6:02:20| monies for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21740)|
| 6:02:22| inspection, or does somebody look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21742)|
| 6:02:24| at the stairwells like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21744)|
| 6:02:26| in the Market Square garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21746)|
| 6:02:28| as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21748)|
| 6:02:30| upkeep of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21750)|
| 6:02:32| Because I park there quite often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21752)|
| 6:02:34| and it looks a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21754)|
| 6:02:36| shoddy from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21756)|
| 6:02:38| and we have visitors from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21758)|
| 6:02:40| How often is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21760)|
| 6:02:42| done? Is that money in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21762)|
| 6:02:44| to keep those stairwells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21764)|
| 6:02:46| looking a little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21766)|
| 6:02:48| Well, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21768)|
| 6:02:50| not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21770)|
| 6:02:52| necessarily a money issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21772)|
| 6:02:54| and it's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21774)|
| 6:02:56| I guess the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21776)|
| 6:02:58| response, Mayor, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21778)|
| 6:03:00| currently the cleanliness of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21780)|
| 6:03:02| garages is the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21782)|
| 6:03:04| of our contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21784)|
| 6:03:06| Republic Parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21786)|
| 6:03:08| We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21788)|
| 6:03:10| very, very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21790)|
| 6:03:12| looking at bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21792)|
| 6:03:14| that in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21794)|
| 6:03:16| and having it be our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21796)|
| 6:03:18| responsibility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21798)|
| 6:03:20| allocating more resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21800)|
| 6:03:22| to exactly that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21802)|
| 6:03:24| because we're paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21804)|
| 6:03:26| a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21806)|
| 6:03:28| a substantial amount of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21808)|
| 6:03:30| to do that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21810)|
| 6:03:32| as man the booths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21812)|
| 6:03:34| and take care of the equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21814)|
| 6:03:36| to some degree and do other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21816)|
| 6:03:38| things. That is an area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21818)|
| 6:03:40| I am not happy with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21820)|
| 6:03:42| and it's frankly one of the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21822)|
| 6:03:44| reasons that we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21824)|
| 6:03:46| at making that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21826)|
| 6:03:48| What we tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21828)|
| 6:03:50| a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21830)|
| 6:03:52| or a year or two ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21832)|
| 6:03:54| was we tried separating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21834)|
| 6:03:56| the toll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21836)|
| 6:03:58| booth attendance and the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21838)|
| 6:04:00| piece and separately bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21840)|
| 6:04:02| the custodial piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21842)|
| 6:04:04| but the numbers came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21844)|
| 6:04:06| so prohibitively high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21846)|
| 6:04:08| that we simply couldn't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21848)|
| 6:04:10| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21850)|
| 6:04:12| We think by bringing it in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21852)|
| 6:04:14| we'll be able to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21854)|
| 6:04:16| in a way that we can get the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21856)|
| 6:04:18| where they make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21858)|
| 6:04:20| in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21860)|
| 6:04:22| Frankly, not just the stairwells. The common areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21862)|
| 6:04:24| in general are beneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21864)|
| 6:04:26| the standards that I'm interested in meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21866)|
| 6:04:28| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21868)|
| 6:04:30| Anything else for Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21870)|
| 6:04:32| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21872)|
| 6:04:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21874)|
| 6:04:36| Mr. Nance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21876)|
| 6:04:40| I assume we've saved the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21880)|
| 6:04:42| for last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21882)|
| 6:04:44| I wouldn't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21884)|
| 6:04:46| give a report. He'd just give me the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21886)|
| 6:04:48| I'll make a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21888)|
| 6:04:50| Done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21890)|
| 6:04:52| Next. I saw Judge Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21892)|
| 6:04:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21894)|
| 6:04:56| Well, listen. Thank you all. Counselor, I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21896)|
| 6:04:58| this opportunity to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21898)|
| 6:05:00| I stand before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21900)|
| 6:05:02| Oh, I'm not certain what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21902)|
| 6:05:04| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21904)|
| 6:05:08| The allocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21908)|
| 6:05:10| what we're going to call to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21910)|
| 6:05:12| KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21912)|
| 6:05:14| this is, I think, the fifth year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21914)|
| 6:05:16| of an $1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21916)|
| 6:05:18| commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21918)|
| 6:05:20| That's the $80,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21920)|
| 6:05:22| I think it's the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21922)|
| 6:05:24| It is $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21924)|
| 6:05:26| It is actually part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21926)|
| 6:05:28| community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21928)|
| 6:05:30| If you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21930)|
| 6:05:32| it's in the capital budget, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21932)|
| 6:05:34| the only thing we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21934)|
| 6:05:36| Got it. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21936)|
| 6:05:38| Sorry. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21938)|
| 6:05:40| All right. Thank you. As Jim said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21940)|
| 6:05:42| our request is part of the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21942)|
| 6:05:44| We're here to request a continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21944)|
| 6:05:46| support of the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21946)|
| 6:05:48| request that KCDC made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21948)|
| 6:05:50| As Jim said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21950)|
| 6:05:52| into our fifth year, we started out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21952)|
| 6:05:54| as a project to address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21954)|
| 6:05:56| Walter P. Teller and the Five Points community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21956)|
| 6:05:58| We are moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21958)|
| 6:06:00| with that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21960)|
| 6:06:02| We have built, to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21962)|
| 6:06:06| 105 new units that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21966)|
| 6:06:08| been occupied. We're currently in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21968)|
| 6:06:10| of building 17 more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21970)|
| 6:06:12| Some of those have been occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21972)|
| 6:06:14| We had a ribbon-cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21974)|

| 6:06:26| taken place. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21986)|
| 6:06:28| also in the process of, through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21988)|
| 6:06:30| some funding that KCDC had available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21990)|
| 6:06:32| we are now looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21992)|
| 6:06:34| select a master planner to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21994)|

| 6:06:40| Walter P. Teller sits at today, to break that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22000)|
| 6:06:42| into phases for us so we can begin to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22002)|
| 6:06:44| our funding need as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22004)|
| 6:06:46| we move forward into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22006)|
| 6:06:48| We anticipate maybe going before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22008)|
| 6:06:50| our board in June to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22010)|
| 6:06:52| get that approval, so that's another step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22012)|
| 6:06:54| in the process of moving the Walter P. Teller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22014)|
| 6:06:56| project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22016)|
| 6:06:58| Right now, we're operating off a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22018)|
| 6:07:00| continuing resolution, so I can't give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22020)|
| 6:07:02| a lot of answers on what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22022)|
| 6:07:04| future funding looks like for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22024)|
| 6:07:06| capital with this side of the HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22026)|
| 6:07:08| budget, because right now, until there is a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22028)|
| 6:07:10| approved by Congress, we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22030)|
| 6:07:12| don't know what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22032)|
| 6:07:14| We are preparing, though, for next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22034)|

| 6:07:30| for another round of building in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22050)|

| 6:07:34| utilize some of that money that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22054)|
| 6:07:36| been asked for this year to be as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22056)|

| 6:08:34| This is Valerie Coleman, for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22114)|
| 6:08:36| who may not know. She's the Municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22116)|
| 6:08:38| Court Administrator. And we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22118)|
| 6:08:40| have Ann Bateman, who is number two in command| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22120)|
| 6:08:42| over there. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22122)|
| 6:08:44| we thank you for letting us come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22124)|
| 6:08:46| We submitted our budget, and we hope it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22126)|
| 6:08:48| meets with your approval. And we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22128)|
| 6:08:50| ask you to consider it and approve it if it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22130)|
| 6:08:52| And we'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22132)|
| 6:08:58| Melissa, which magic page am I on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22138)|
| 6:09:00| I'm sorry. I was reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22140)|
| 6:09:02| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22142)|
| 6:09:04| How much money comes from the red lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22144)|
| 6:09:06| Cameras? Less and less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22146)|
| 6:09:08| She can probably give you a figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22148)|
| 6:09:10| but I can tell you it's way, way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22150)|
| 6:09:12| Is that because of no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22152)|
| 6:09:14| turning on red anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22154)|
| 6:09:16| I was told some number of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22156)|
| 6:09:18| that knocked about 70 percent of it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22158)|
| 6:09:20| And it was a little over a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22160)|
| 6:09:22| a year, I think, at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22162)|
| 6:09:24| It was two, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22164)|
| 6:09:26| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22166)|
| 6:09:28| It was roughly 1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22168)|
| 6:09:30| Now I think we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22170)|
| 6:09:32| a lot, something more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22172)|
| 6:09:34| on the order of less than 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22174)|
| 6:09:36| Really? That much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22176)|
| 6:09:38| Worse than I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22178)|
| 6:09:40| It's still turning right on red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22180)|
| 6:09:42| Well, again, it's a combination of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22182)|
| 6:09:44| a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22184)|
| 6:09:46| One is the right turn on red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22186)|
| 6:09:48| And then we expected some drop-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22188)|
| 6:09:50| as people get used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22190)|
| 6:09:52| the lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22192)|
| 6:09:54| because that's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22194)|
| 6:09:56| You want to do some, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22196)|
| 6:09:58| operant conditioning or whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22198)|
| 6:10:00| behavior modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22200)|
| 6:10:02| so that people aren't running those red lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22202)|
| 6:10:04| So we did expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22204)|
| 6:10:06| a drop-off there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22206)|
| 6:10:08| and then the right turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22208)|
| 6:10:10| on red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22210)|
| 6:10:12| has probably had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22212)|
| 6:10:14| a more significant impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22214)|
| 6:10:16| So the budget's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22216)|
| 6:10:18| page 21 in the middle of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22218)|
| 6:10:20| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22220)|
| 6:10:22| according to this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22222)|
| 6:10:24| there's a 3.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22224)|
| 6:10:26| excess fees collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22226)|
| 6:10:28| that's transferred to the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22228)|
| 6:10:30| which is 291,000 more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22230)|
| 6:10:32| than last year, which is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22232)|
| 6:10:39| If I can say something about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22239)|
| 6:10:41| we would like to thank the information systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22241)|
| 6:10:43| for helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22243)|
| 6:10:45| I think one of the things we did to help raise that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22245)|
| 6:10:47| was suspend more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22247)|
| 6:10:49| driver's licenses electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22249)|
| 6:10:51| They came up with a formula that was doing it a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22251)|
| 6:10:53| for people that were not paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22253)|
| 6:10:55| or not showing up in cohorts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22255)|
| 6:10:57| I really appreciate the information systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22257)|
| 6:10:59| Janet, for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22259)|
| 6:11:01| That's a big help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22261)|
| 6:11:03| for the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22263)|
| 6:11:05| operating fund to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22265)|
| 6:11:07| It's about eight cents on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22267)|
| 6:11:09| current tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22269)|
| 6:11:11| And that along with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22271)|
| 6:11:13| we now have online payments, so people can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22273)|
| 6:11:15| online and make their payments and not have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22275)|
| 6:11:17| actually come to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22277)|
| 6:11:19| to make it. So that's a big plus as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22279)|
| 6:11:23| So you're talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22283)|
| 6:11:25| what you implemented last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22285)|
| 6:11:27| to go after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22287)|
| 6:11:29| folks who hadn't paid their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22289)|
| 6:11:31| court costs and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22291)|
| 6:11:33| fines and what have you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22293)|
| 6:11:35| Is that an extension by taking their license away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22295)|
| 6:11:37| That was always going on to an extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22297)|
| 6:11:39| It's just going on more efficiently now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22299)|
| 6:11:43| Awesome. That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22303)|
| 6:11:45| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22305)|
| 6:11:47| Do we still have an issue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22307)|
| 6:11:49| people who have had their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22309)|
| 6:11:51| licenses suspended but continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22311)|
| 6:11:53| to have a need to drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22313)|
| 6:11:55| Oh, yes. The new settlement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22315)|
| 6:11:57| you probably saw it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22317)|
| 6:11:59| it's been a year or two ago now, I think they reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22319)|
| 6:12:01| that 24% of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22321)|
| 6:12:03| Tennesseans, I don't know what the percentage is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22323)|
| 6:12:05| for Knoxville, but 24% of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22325)|
| 6:12:07| Tennesseans are driving without license and insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22327)|
| 6:12:09| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22329)|
| 6:12:11| that's a significant number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22331)|
| 6:12:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22333)|
| 6:12:15| Any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22335)|
| 6:12:17| of Jed Rawson or his staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22337)|
| 6:12:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22339)|
| 6:12:21| Thank you all. Thank you very much for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22341)|
| 6:12:23| Good to see you. Let's go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22343)|
| 6:12:25| break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22345)|
| 6:12:27| to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22347)|
| 6:12:29| at the 5 o'clock public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22349)|
| 6:12:31| I just wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22351)|
| 6:12:33| I wanted to thank Melissa again for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22353)|
| 6:12:35| outline. It's made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22355)|
| 6:12:37| I know for the last three years, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22357)|
| 6:12:39| made it so much simpler to not only understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22359)|
| 6:12:41| the budget but also where to find everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22361)|
| 6:12:43| And Melissa, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22363)|
| 6:12:45| on behalf of all of us, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22365)|
| 6:12:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22367)|
| 6:13:01| We do need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22381)|
| 6:13:03| to reconvene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22383)|
| 6:13:05| so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22385)|
| 6:13:07| adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22387)|
| 6:13:13| We're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22393)|
| 6:13:15| reconvene here briefly. Obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22395)|
| 6:13:17| there's no one here to speak, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22397)|
| 6:13:19| need to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22399)|
| 6:13:21| that this is the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22401)|
| 6:13:23| section of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22403)|
| 6:13:25| meeting, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22405)|
| 6:13:27| I don't see a soul here. Nobody has signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22407)|
| 6:13:29| up to speak. I just would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22409)|
| 6:13:31| to take this opportunity to thank council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22411)|
| 6:13:33| and, again, the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22413)|
| 6:13:35| for all the diligence and the hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22415)|
| 6:13:37| work that's gone into this budget and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22417)|
| 6:13:39| the good questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22419)|
| 6:13:41| the vetting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22421)|
| 6:13:43| process. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22423)|
| 6:13:45| it's been a long day, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22425)|
| 6:13:47| we did a good job of moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22427)|
| 6:13:49| it along and not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22429)|
| 6:13:51| to use another half day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22431)|
| 6:13:53| So I'm glad that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22433)|
| 6:13:55| worked out as kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22435)|
| 6:13:57| test, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22437)|
| 6:13:59| But I'm going to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22439)|
| 6:14:01| Councilman Wallace at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22441)|
| 6:14:03| Thank you. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22443)|
| 6:14:05| it was a very informative day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22445)|
| 6:14:07| I'd like to propose we take a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22447)|
| 6:14:09| and just chat about it, you know, while we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22449)|
| 6:14:11| the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22451)|
| 6:14:13| My concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22453)|
| 6:14:15| is in the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22455)|
| 6:14:17| improvements and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22457)|
| 6:14:19| for the bond issue, for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22459)|
| 6:14:21| $31 million capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22461)|
| 6:14:23| And my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22463)|
| 6:14:25| is just whether that's enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22465)|
| 6:14:27| and whether that's the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22467)|
| 6:14:29| projects to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22469)|
| 6:14:31| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22471)|
| 6:14:33| I'm not saying it's not, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22473)|
| 6:14:35| I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22475)|
| 6:14:37| we need to think about some other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22477)|
| 6:14:39| And we've talked about, I've talked a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22479)|
| 6:14:41| parking garages, and those are an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22481)|
| 6:14:43| economic developer for the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22483)|
| 6:14:45| Knoxville. We've proven that with Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22485)|
| 6:14:47| We're spending a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22487)|
| 6:14:49| of money. You're getting ready to spend a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22489)|
| 6:14:51| in Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22491)|
| 6:14:53| Parking is a problem down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22493)|
| 6:14:55| You're getting ready to add a whole bunch of new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22495)|
| 6:14:57| more new to the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22497)|
| 6:14:59| residential units in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22499)|
| 6:15:01| And it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22501)|
| 6:15:03| continue to put pressure on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22503)|
| 6:15:05| I would propose that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22505)|
| 6:15:07| postpone the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22507)|
| 6:15:09| on the second reading and give us some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22509)|
| 6:15:11| to meet with the mayor and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22511)|
| 6:15:13| what opportunities are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22513)|
| 6:15:15| and make sure that $31 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22515)|
| 6:15:17| enough or if $31 is the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22517)|
| 6:15:19| $31 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22519)|
| 6:15:21| give us some time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22521)|
| 6:15:23| really kind of delve into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22523)|
| 6:15:25| The rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22525)|
| 6:15:27| budget is pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22527)|
| 6:15:29| Not too much whistles and bells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22529)|
| 6:15:31| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22531)|
| 6:15:33| you don't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22533)|
| 6:15:35| bond issues, but the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22535)|
| 6:15:37| one you did was eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22537)|
| 6:15:39| For the mayor and for many of us sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22539)|
| 6:15:41| on council, this is your legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22541)|
| 6:15:43| And I would question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22543)|
| 6:15:45| whether those are the right, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22545)|
| 6:15:47| we need to vet that out. These are the right projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22547)|
| 6:15:49| and these are the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22549)|
| 6:15:51| your time on this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22551)|
| 6:15:53| and for her, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22553)|
| 6:15:55| what you're going to be known for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22555)|
| 6:15:57| It's what these improvements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22557)|
| 6:15:59| And in public service, that may be the best thing for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22559)|
| 6:16:01| But I think that's going to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22561)|
| 6:16:03| as your project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22563)|
| 6:16:05| in the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22565)|
| 6:16:07| Is that the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22567)|
| 6:16:09| you want to spend $10 million? It sounds like to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22569)|
| 6:16:11| that you almost made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22571)|
| 6:16:13| cash flow that deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22573)|
| 6:16:15| They're only going to need it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22575)|
| 6:16:17| five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22577)|
| 6:16:19| I don't know how much leeway we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22579)|
| 6:16:21| I don't know whether you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22581)|
| 6:16:23| substitute things. There seems to be a lot around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22583)|
| 6:16:25| the bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22585)|
| 6:16:27| These are your big projects for our term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22587)|
| 6:16:29| and for our mayor's term. I think we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22589)|
| 6:16:31| that those are the right projects long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22591)|
| 6:16:33| for the city. I think the other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22593)|
| 6:16:35| is about the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22595)|
| 6:16:37| There's money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22597)|
| 6:16:39| being flowed into the Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22599)|
| 6:16:41| in a building that is way outdated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22601)|
| 6:16:43| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22603)|
| 6:16:45| needs a lot of money spent on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22605)|
| 6:16:47| And Chill Highway Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22607)|
| 6:16:49| is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22609)|
| 6:16:51| We don't do bond issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22611)|
| 6:16:53| very often. I think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22613)|
| 6:16:55| make sure we get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22615)|
| 6:16:57| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22617)|
| 6:16:59| Thank you. Before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22619)|
| 6:17:01| comment on what George just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22621)|
| 6:17:03| I want to thank Cindy and Melissa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22623)|
| 6:17:05| for the incredible job in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22625)|
| 6:17:07| keeping track of us today. This has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22627)|
| 6:17:09| made the day a lot easier. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22629)|
| 6:17:11| George,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22631)|
| 6:17:13| I understand what you've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22633)|
| 6:17:15| and I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22635)|
| 6:17:17| amount of borrowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22637)|
| 6:17:19| certainly needs to be talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22639)|
| 6:17:21| I would ask Rob, though, to opine on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22641)|
| 6:17:23| kind of what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22643)|
| 6:17:25| relative to this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22645)|
| 6:17:27| that's been presented. I know going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22647)|
| 6:17:29| we can have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22649)|
| 6:17:31| input and will have. And I suspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22651)|
| 6:17:33| we have had to this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22653)|
| 6:17:35| process. Thank you. Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22655)|
| 6:17:37| doesn't have line item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22657)|
| 6:17:39| say so in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22659)|
| 6:17:41| You can make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22661)|
| 6:17:43| I'm sure, particularly if there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22663)|
| 6:17:45| five or more of you, recommendations would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22665)|
| 6:17:47| be strongly listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22667)|
| 6:17:49| to. I'm not speaking for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22669)|
| 6:17:51| administration, obviously. But you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22671)|
| 6:17:53| might want, if people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22673)|
| 6:17:55| concerns, they might want to individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22675)|
| 6:17:57| take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22677)|
| 6:17:59| I don't know if you can speak with the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22679)|
| 6:18:01| or Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22681)|
| 6:18:03| or Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22683)|
| 6:18:05| Maybe some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22685)|
| 6:18:07| can be addressed that way, but we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22687)|
| 6:18:09| go through and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22689)|
| 6:18:11| out of fund whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22691)|
| 6:18:13| I want to increase this or decrease that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22693)|
| 6:18:15| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22695)|
| 6:18:17| maybe something cooperatively can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22697)|
| 6:18:19| worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22699)|
| 6:18:21| But I think given George's scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22701)|
| 6:18:23| that you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22703)|
| 6:18:25| amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22705)|
| 6:18:27| or, you know, you could add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22707)|
| 6:18:29| or take away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22709)|
| 6:18:31| the bond issuance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22711)|
| 6:18:33| if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22713)|
| 6:18:35| Yeah, I think capital, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22715)|
| 6:18:37| you could suggest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22717)|
| 6:18:39| not doing specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22719)|
| 6:18:41| projects and having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22721)|
| 6:18:43| a different capital total. We have authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22723)|
| 6:18:45| to do departmental total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22725)|
| 6:18:47| and to give that back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22727)|
| 6:18:49| them. And you could make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22729)|
| 6:18:51| the amendment that you take if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22731)|
| 6:18:53| wanted to take all five of those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22733)|
| 6:18:55| out and not do the bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22735)|
| 6:18:57| this year and just leave capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22737)|
| 6:18:59| the same other than that. You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22739)|
| 6:19:01| Bonds are voted on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22741)|
| 6:19:03| And I'll say, too, I mean, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22743)|
| 6:19:05| I know we have to approve a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22745)|
| 6:19:07| before July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22747)|
| 6:19:09| So, I mean, if we were going to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22749)|
| 6:19:11| that path, and so what would happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22751)|
| 6:19:13| that the, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22753)|
| 6:19:15| the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22755)|
| 6:19:17| budget would go in place if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22757)|
| 6:19:19| didn't have a budget in place by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22759)|
| 6:19:21| July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22761)|
| 6:19:23| Is there a distinction between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22763)|
| 6:19:25| annual budget? June 15th. Okay, my bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22765)|
| 6:19:27| The annual budget, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22767)|
| 6:19:29| the one that Rob was talking to about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22769)|
| 6:19:31| line item changes in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22771)|
| 6:19:33| capital budget, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22773)|
| 6:19:35| more or less sort of a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22775)|
| 6:19:37| of a five-year plan. I'm not sure what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22777)|
| 6:19:39| I mean, obviously, we do things in year 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22779)|
| 6:19:41| 2, 3, and 4, but it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22781)|
| 6:19:43| to me that that changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22783)|
| 6:19:45| But you could amend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22785)|
| 6:19:47| document and take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22787)|
| 6:19:49| segment of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22789)|
| 6:19:51| projects out and not pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22791)|
| 6:19:53| the part that's related to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22793)|
| 6:19:55| bond issue. You could do that. You could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22795)|
| 6:19:57| make that. I mean, you could pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22797)|
| 6:19:59| a part that's smaller than 31 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22799)|
| 6:20:01| without the 31 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22801)|
| 6:20:03| Yeah, adjust it how you want to, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22803)|
| 6:20:05| now they wouldn't have to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22805)|
| 6:20:07| But you're basically giving them the authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22807)|
| 6:20:09| to go to the bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22809)|
| 6:20:11| market, basically is what he was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22811)|
| 6:20:13| that you're just authorizing that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22813)|
| 6:20:15| occur in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22815)|
| 6:20:17| But if you took those five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22817)|
| 6:20:19| things off the plate, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22819)|
| 6:20:21| the capital would stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22821)|
| 6:20:23| as it is without those five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22823)|
| 6:20:25| items and the bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22825)|
| 6:20:27| related bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22827)|
| 6:20:29| I thought George's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22829)|
| 6:20:31| was broader, and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22831)|
| 6:20:33| he was looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22833)|
| 6:20:35| future planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22835)|
| 6:20:37| Where's the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22837)|
| 6:20:39| place to put our bucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22839)|
| 6:20:41| Can you get a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22841)|
| 6:20:43| return on investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22843)|
| 6:20:45| This stuff's all going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22845)|
| 6:20:47| somewhat slowly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22847)|
| 6:20:49| over time, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22849)|
| 6:20:51| determining our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22851)|
| 6:20:53| I thought that was the thrust of where you were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22853)|
| 6:20:55| Let's talk about the philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22855)|
| 6:20:57| of it. It's how I was reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22857)|
| 6:20:59| you without looking at the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22859)|
| 6:21:01| I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22861)|
| 6:21:03| Do you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22863)|
| 6:21:05| bond issues at the right MAB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22865)|
| 6:21:07| Is it enough? And what projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22867)|
| 6:21:11| And the timing of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22871)|
| 6:21:13| Anyway, I don't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22873)|
| 6:21:15| it's wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22875)|
| 6:21:17| Of course, Jim was saying he's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22877)|
| 6:21:19| running to the bond market tomorrow anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22879)|
| 6:21:21| and he would bring a bond issue to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22881)|
| 6:21:23| He's looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22883)|
| 6:21:25| to see if he's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22885)|
| 6:21:27| the categories and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22887)|
| 6:21:29| what they are and the amounts kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22889)|
| 6:21:31| but that's somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22891)|
| 6:21:33| fluid. Maybe Jim could tell us a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22893)|
| 6:21:35| about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22895)|
| 6:21:37| and that capital budget aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22897)|
| 6:21:39| because it seems to me like the annual operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22899)|
| 6:21:41| budget, we're trying to pay our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22901)|
| 6:21:43| employees to do the job that we all need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22903)|
| 6:21:45| them to do, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22905)|
| 6:21:47| most of those costs are predetermined by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22907)|
| 6:21:49| the numbers of people we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22909)|
| 6:21:51| They're running the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22911)|
| 6:21:53| with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22913)|
| 6:21:55| costs that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22915)|
| 6:21:57| Jim, can you enlighten us a little bit more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22917)|
| 6:21:59| this capital side of the story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22919)|
| 6:22:01| and the funding of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22921)|
| 6:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22923)|
| 6:22:05| I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22925)|
| 6:22:07| try to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22927)|
| 6:22:09| The budget as presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22929)|
| 6:22:11| includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22931)|
| 6:22:13| a capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22933)|
| 6:22:15| or what we call a capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22935)|
| 6:22:17| It's a one-year budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22937)|
| 6:22:19| allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22939)|
| 6:22:25| If you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22945)|
| 6:22:27| to pass this budget, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22947)|
| 6:22:29| basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22949)|
| 6:22:31| allocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22951)|
| 6:22:33| $10 million to the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22953)|
| 6:22:35| $5.2 million to Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22955)|
| 6:22:37| so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22957)|
| 6:22:41| In terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22961)|
| 6:22:43| funding, we have recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22963)|
| 6:22:45| that we go to the bond market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22965)|
| 6:22:47| to fund five separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22967)|
| 6:22:49| projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22969)|
| 6:22:51| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22971)|
| 6:22:53| as I indicated, we will not be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22973)|
| 6:22:55| forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22975)|
| 6:22:57| on July 1st with a proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22977)|
| 6:22:59| bond issue. We want to take a look at all our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22979)|
| 6:23:01| options and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22981)|
| 6:23:03| I think it was indicated today that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22983)|
| 6:23:05| we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22985)|
| 6:23:07| multiyear funding on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22987)|
| 6:23:09| the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22989)|
| 6:23:11| We will probably be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22991)|
| 6:23:13| next spring before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22993)|
| 6:23:15| do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22995)|
| 6:23:17| Prosser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22997)|
| 6:23:19| Likewise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=22999)|
| 6:23:21| and again, I'm not an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23001)|
| 6:23:23| engineer, but I'm guessing it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23003)|
| 6:23:25| kind of an 18-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23005)|
| 6:23:27| and Councilmember Grieve may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23007)|
| 6:23:29| actually have a better idea on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23009)|
| 6:23:31| but you're probably looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23011)|
| 6:23:33| at 12 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23013)|
| 6:23:35| 18 months on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23015)|
| 6:23:37| public works complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23017)|
| 6:23:40| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23020)|
| 6:23:42| Lakeshore, I just don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23022)|
| 6:23:44| good feel on that one because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23024)|
| 6:23:46| how quickly we can get underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23026)|
| 6:23:48| because we may be able to move that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23028)|
| 6:23:50| along fairly quickly once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23030)|
| 6:23:52| we get possession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23032)|
| 6:23:54| of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23034)|
| 6:24:00| But in terms of cash flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23040)|
| 6:24:02| you're not going to have $31.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23042)|
| 6:24:04| million in cash flow over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23044)|
| 6:24:06| That's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23046)|
| 6:24:08| So we want to time that so we can minimize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23048)|
| 6:24:10| our interest, our borrowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23050)|
| 6:24:12| cost and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23052)|
| 6:24:14| And as I indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23054)|
| 6:24:16| any, I'll tell you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23056)|
| 6:24:18| front, if I bring a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23058)|
| 6:24:20| bond proposal to you, it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23060)|
| 6:24:22| fairly broadly written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23062)|
| 6:24:24| so that we have some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23064)|
| 6:24:26| in terms of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23066)|
| 6:24:28| And it will probably say that we may do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23068)|
| 6:24:30| this project and this project and various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23070)|
| 6:24:32| other public improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23072)|
| 6:24:34| because, again, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23074)|
| 6:24:36| personally like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23076)|
| 6:24:38| have very broad authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23078)|
| 6:24:40| in case so it gives us some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23080)|
| 6:24:42| to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23082)|
| 6:24:44| if we run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23084)|
| 6:24:46| a fallow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23086)|
| 6:24:48| funding issue. So for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23088)|
| 6:24:50| let's say that we thought we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23090)|
| 6:24:52| could do the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23092)|
| 6:24:54| works complex over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23094)|
| 6:24:56| 12 months. You know, that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23096)|
| 6:24:58| fairly sizable piece. We could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23098)|
| 6:25:00| come to the market and borrow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23100)|
| 6:25:02| Well, let's say all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23102)|
| 6:25:04| we start doing it and we run a fallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23104)|
| 6:25:06| We hit something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23106)|
| 6:25:08| Bad soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23108)|
| 6:25:10| Bad soil or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23110)|
| 6:25:12| in delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23112)|
| 6:25:14| Well, if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23114)|
| 6:25:16| bond resolution is written broadly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23116)|
| 6:25:18| enough, that gives us some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23118)|
| 6:25:20| Okay, well, we do have this one ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23120)|
| 6:25:22| We can fund that with bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23122)|
| 6:25:24| Say we're going to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23124)|
| 6:25:26| project X with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23126)|
| 6:25:28| funds, we'll just shift those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23128)|
| 6:25:30| And that's one of the things that you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23130)|
| 6:25:32| as part of this bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23132)|
| 6:25:34| issuance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23134)|
| 6:25:36| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23136)|
| 6:25:38| I'm talking. I'm not sure if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23138)|
| 6:25:40| answering Council Member Duggan's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23140)|
| 6:25:42| I think you are. You're just helping us understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23142)|
| 6:25:44| what we're, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23144)|
| 6:25:46| authorizing and what you see as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23146)|
| 6:25:48| the logical horizon as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23148)|
| 6:25:50| go forward. But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23150)|
| 6:25:52| if you adopt the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23152)|
| 6:25:54| as proposed, and we are recommending that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23154)|
| 6:25:56| adopt the budget as proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23156)|
| 6:25:58| you're committing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23158)|
| 6:26:00| $31.2 million in projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23160)|
| 6:26:02| The specific funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23162)|
| 6:26:04| arrangement, we've talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23164)|
| 6:26:06| We've identified bond proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23166)|
| 6:26:08| But that money may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23168)|
| 6:26:10| shift around. So, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23170)|
| 6:26:12| as long as it's not earmarked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23172)|
| 6:26:14| For example, gas tax money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23174)|
| 6:26:16| it's restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23176)|
| 6:26:18| But some of the other funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23178)|
| 6:26:20| it's like taking it out of one pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23180)|
| 6:26:22| and move it to the other pocket. And we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23182)|
| 6:26:24| maintain that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23184)|
| 6:26:26| You could go to the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23186)|
| 6:26:28| more than once, too, couldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23188)|
| 6:26:30| We can stagger this. That may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23190)|
| 6:26:32| part of the strategy we'll look at. And we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23192)|
| 6:26:34| stagger part this year and part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23194)|
| 6:26:36| next year. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23196)|
| 6:26:38| again, we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23198)|
| 6:26:40| present a package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23200)|
| 6:26:42| of improvements that we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23202)|
| 6:26:44| are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23204)|
| 6:26:46| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23206)|
| 6:26:48| I'll be working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23208)|
| 6:26:50| with the administration and we'll try and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23210)|
| 6:26:52| come up with a good financing package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23212)|
| 6:26:54| And let's hear from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23214)|
| 6:26:56| I'd like to address what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23216)|
| 6:26:58| Councilman Wallace raised. Maybe to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23218)|
| 6:27:00| something. In preparing this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23220)|
| 6:27:02| these capital items, we look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23222)|
| 6:27:04| at as all things we are already committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23224)|
| 6:27:06| to and already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23226)|
| 6:27:08| And any of the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23228)|
| 6:27:10| costs that may be out there, let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23230)|
| 6:27:12| a garage, and we don't have a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23232)|
| 6:27:14| project or a garage located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23234)|
| 6:27:16| at this point that we would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23236)|
| 6:27:18| that's why when there are other potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23238)|
| 6:27:20| uses of capital dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23240)|
| 6:27:22| But the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23242)|
| 6:27:24| to go to the market is a financing decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23244)|
| 6:27:26| We are, over years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23246)|
| 6:27:28| bought the land for public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23248)|
| 6:27:30| spent money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23250)|
| 6:27:32| appropriated money for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23252)|
| 6:27:34| planning and the design of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23254)|
| 6:27:36| Once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23256)|
| 6:27:38| in with that, once pregnant with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23258)|
| 6:27:40| you know, once you get going, you're either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23260)|
| 6:27:42| talking about building part of it and stopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23262)|
| 6:27:44| and then waiting for another year and building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23264)|
| 6:27:46| part of it or waiting and holding you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23266)|
| 6:27:48| fire-wise. I think Jim was saying alternatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23268)|
| 6:27:50| by waiting until you appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23270)|
| 6:27:52| year after year enough money in getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23272)|
| 6:27:54| it. It seemed as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23274)|
| 6:27:56| financing method, given the interest and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23276)|
| 6:27:58| giving everything else, that made a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23278)|
| 6:28:00| more sense. Same with Lakeshore. This was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23280)|
| 6:28:02| that came to us. We're obligated under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23282)|
| 6:28:04| contract to knock down these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23284)|
| 6:28:06| We have to do that in getting these from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23286)|
| 6:28:08| the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23288)|
| 6:28:10| The zoo, I think as you heard, we were already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23290)|
| 6:28:12| spending X amount of money a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23292)|
| 6:28:14| but this certainty that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23294)|
| 6:28:16| money will be forthcoming allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23296)|
| 6:28:18| them to plan and allows them to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23298)|
| 6:28:20| the markets. And not to get into all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23300)|
| 6:28:22| substantive arguments about these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23302)|
| 6:28:24| but I think there is one principle that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23304)|
| 6:28:26| want to underscore, that none of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23306)|
| 6:28:28| are new projects that the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23308)|
| 6:28:30| and administration has picked out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23310)|
| 6:28:32| go and go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23312)|
| 6:28:34| market for. They are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23314)|
| 6:28:36| financing for projects already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23316)|
| 6:28:38| underway. And I think that's an important distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23318)|
| 6:28:40| And once you start looking into other opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23320)|
| 6:28:42| you're really getting into new projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23322)|
| 6:28:44| which I think is philosophically a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23324)|
| 6:28:47| I would also point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23327)|
| 6:28:49| and this has to do with the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23329)|
| 6:28:51| and trust me, I may be a year off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23331)|
| 6:28:53| on this arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23333)|
| 6:28:55| We have a five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23335)|
| 6:28:57| management agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23337)|
| 6:28:59| Knoxville Zoological Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23339)|
| 6:29:01| And as part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23341)|
| 6:29:03| we have made a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23343)|
| 6:29:05| for $5 million worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23345)|
| 6:29:07| of capital funding. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23347)|
| 6:29:09| this is year two. It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23349)|
| 6:29:11| So, last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23351)|
| 6:29:13| we committed $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23353)|
| 6:29:15| You basically are committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23355)|
| 6:29:17| to $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23357)|
| 6:29:19| Now, that's $4.5 million, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23359)|
| 6:29:21| spread over four years. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23361)|
| 6:29:23| admit that. And what the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23363)|
| 6:29:25| has requested is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23365)|
| 6:29:27| to not only commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23367)|
| 6:29:29| to that $4.5 million, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23369)|
| 6:29:31| basically operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23371)|
| 6:29:33| under the assumption that a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23373)|
| 6:29:35| contract, four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23375)|
| 6:29:37| from now, would have a similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23377)|
| 6:29:39| kind of arrangement. And that's what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23379)|
| 6:29:41| doing is we're just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23381)|
| 6:29:43| making a commitment at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23383)|
| 6:29:45| time that we'll fund up to $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23385)|
| 6:29:47| And it enables them to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23387)|
| 6:29:49| to donors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23389)|
| 6:29:51| and try and solicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23391)|
| 6:29:53| other funds to match that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23393)|
| 6:29:55| That's an extension of what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23395)|
| 6:29:57| Well, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23397)|
| 6:29:59| the $4.5 million, you're committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23399)|
| 6:30:01| to the $4.5 million because we have a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23401)|
| 6:30:03| that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23403)|
| 6:30:05| $4.5 million over five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23405)|
| 6:30:07| Well, it was $5 million over five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23407)|
| 6:30:09| years and we've already budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23409)|
| 6:30:11| $500,000. So, the balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23411)|
| 6:30:13| on that commitment is $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23413)|
| 6:30:15| Okay. Let's hear from Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23415)|
| 6:30:17| Jim, what I was going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23417)|
| 6:30:19| and what I asked the question earlier, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23419)|
| 6:30:21| in terms of the commitment to those particular projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23421)|
| 6:30:23| and if, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23423)|
| 6:30:25| instance, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23425)|
| 6:30:27| we'll take the Coliseum, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23427)|
| 6:30:29| that needs some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23429)|
| 6:30:31| work, you know, update as far as ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23431)|
| 6:30:33| and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23433)|
| 6:30:35| Am I understanding this correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23435)|
| 6:30:37| that the projects that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23437)|
| 6:30:39| looking at for the $30 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23439)|
| 6:30:41| in other words, we couldn't say next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23441)|
| 6:30:43| year all of a sudden we need to update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23443)|
| 6:30:45| the Coliseum? In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23445)|
| 6:30:47| there's several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23447)|
| 6:30:49| facilities that we have as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23449)|
| 6:30:51| I know there's been talk in the past about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23451)|
| 6:30:53| expanding the Jacobs Building because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23453)|
| 6:30:55| some work that could be done out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23455)|
| 6:30:57| and then there's the Coliseum which does need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23457)|
| 6:30:59| updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23459)|
| 6:31:01| How much flexibility do you have in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23461)|
| 6:31:03| of the $30 million or is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23463)|
| 6:31:05| the time to ask for $40 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23465)|
| 6:31:07| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23467)|
| 6:31:09| let me just say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23469)|
| 6:31:11| until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23471)|
| 6:31:13| you actually go to the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23473)|
| 6:31:15| everything is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23475)|
| 6:31:19| We are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23479)|
| 6:31:21| and I'll give you a hypothetical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23481)|
| 6:31:23| example, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23483)|
| 6:31:25| may come to be true, we may decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23485)|
| 6:31:27| that we are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23487)|
| 6:31:31| bring a, what we call a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23491)|
| 6:31:33| of intent that say that we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23493)|
| 6:31:35| self-fund or cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23495)|
| 6:31:37| these projects until some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23497)|
| 6:31:39| we actually go out to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23499)|
| 6:31:41| Now, when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23501)|
| 6:31:43| choose to go out to the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23503)|
| 6:31:45| you may well have anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23505)|
| 6:31:47| that you were going to do $31.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23507)|
| 6:31:49| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23509)|
| 6:31:51| circumstances have changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23511)|
| 6:31:53| and you may decide, well, now it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23513)|
| 6:31:55| you know, we were able to squeeze something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23515)|
| 6:31:57| out and now it's $28 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23517)|
| 6:31:59| conversely there's another project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23519)|
| 6:32:01| that's desired and you may want to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23521)|
| 6:32:03| at $40. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23523)|
| 6:32:05| until you actually go to the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23525)|
| 6:32:07| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23527)|
| 6:32:09| you're not saying that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23529)|
| 6:32:11| bond issue is going to be $31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23531)|
| 6:32:13| and, you know, $0.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23533)|
| 6:32:15| To be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23535)|
| 6:32:17| even if we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23537)|
| 6:32:19| these specific projects, it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23539)|
| 6:32:21| change from $31.4, I can tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23541)|
| 6:32:23| because we'll get into issuance costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23543)|
| 6:32:25| and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23545)|
| 6:32:27| the sheer numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23547)|
| 6:32:29| and the way we finance it would probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23549)|
| 6:32:31| I guess premium, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23551)|
| 6:32:33| it won't look like $31.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23553)|
| 6:32:35| That won't be the par amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23555)|
| 6:32:37| Has the administration looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23557)|
| 6:32:39| other potential projects such as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23559)|
| 6:32:41| renovation of the Coliseum or expansion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23561)|
| 6:32:43| Jacobs Building or parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23563)|
| 6:32:45| or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23565)|
| 6:32:47| We had some general discussion about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23567)|
| 6:32:49| you know, other opportunities, capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23569)|
| 6:32:51| opportunities, even including, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23571)|
| 6:32:53| sidewalks. We had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23573)|
| 6:32:55| internal discussion of that, you know, making a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23575)|
| 6:32:57| non-incremental jump there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23577)|
| 6:32:59| We really haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23579)|
| 6:33:01| we didn't have, I would say, lengthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23581)|
| 6:33:03| discussions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23583)|
| 6:33:05| specifics like, you know, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23585)|
| 6:33:07| how much would it take to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23587)|
| 6:33:09| Chell Highway Park and the Coliseum or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23589)|
| 6:33:11| all those other assets to a certain point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23591)|
| 6:33:13| And we didn't partially because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23593)|
| 6:33:15| I think we decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23595)|
| 6:33:17| to keep this ask in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23597)|
| 6:33:19| terms of the going to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23599)|
| 6:33:21| market and not much over $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23601)|
| 6:33:23| And that sort of drove what we considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23603)|
| 6:33:25| rather than getting the whole set of possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23605)|
| 6:33:27| and then seeing what it came up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23607)|
| 6:33:29| I guess I'll defer a little to Jim on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23609)|
| 6:33:31| You might say that the 31 as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23611)|
| 6:33:33| a limit is somewhat arbitrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23613)|
| 6:33:35| but we still want to be fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23615)|
| 6:33:37| careful on how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23617)|
| 6:33:39| we commit to. And, of course, you know, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23619)|
| 6:33:41| to take into account what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23621)|
| 6:33:43| cost of amortizing that over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23623)|
| 6:33:45| you know, and that's something Jim has taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23625)|
| 6:33:47| into account in preparing the budget, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23627)|
| 6:33:49| as we look for what we can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23629)|
| 6:33:51| yearly, you know, under what you were thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23631)|
| 6:33:53| of 20 years, under a 20-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23633)|
| 6:33:55| repayment. So I would think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23635)|
| 6:33:57| the coming up with these, first, we knew we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23637)|
| 6:33:59| had these projects. Secondly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23639)|
| 6:34:01| we had a goal of somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23641)|
| 6:34:03| in the neighborhood of 30 to 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23643)|
| 6:34:05| I think, is the max that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23645)|
| 6:34:07| we thought doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23647)|
| 6:34:09| Much under that, we didn't think was worth going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23649)|
| 6:34:11| the market. At some point, you want to get it to a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23651)|
| 6:34:13| point or you don't go to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23653)|
| 6:34:15| So coming up with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23655)|
| 6:34:17| wasn't, you know, a perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23657)|
| 6:34:19| a perfect system of logic that led us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23659)|
| 6:34:21| that. But the thinking was we've got these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23661)|
| 6:34:23| we're already obligated to, rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23663)|
| 6:34:25| are low, we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23665)|
| 6:34:27| we can comfortably go to 30, a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23667)|
| 6:34:29| over 30 million. We're not much comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23669)|
| 6:34:31| going a whole lot higher than that. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23671)|
| 6:34:33| could make an argument to go to 40 or 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23673)|
| 6:34:35| I guess. But I don't think anybody internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23675)|
| 6:34:37| was really interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23677)|
| 6:34:39| pushing the envelope that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23679)|
| 6:34:41| There's a table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23681)|
| 6:34:43| that says 2.1 million. Hold on, let me go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23683)|
| 6:34:45| Councilwoman. Let him finish with his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23685)|
| 6:34:47| financial because I want to speak about the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23687)|
| 6:34:49| Okay. I was just going to ask, Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23689)|
| 6:34:51| you've got a table in your budget that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23691)|
| 6:34:53| 2.1 million dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23693)|
| 6:34:55| amortization of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23695)|
| 6:34:57| capital debt. Isn't that what I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23697)|
| 6:34:59| seeing? It's spread out, like you said, over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23699)|
| 6:35:01| 20 years or whatever. Yeah. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23701)|
| 6:35:03| the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23703)|
| 6:35:05| I have estimated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23705)|
| 6:35:07| again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23707)|
| 6:35:09| amortization on 31.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23709)|
| 6:35:11| dollars. And that's going to be roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23711)|
| 6:35:13| 2.1 million. And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23713)|
| 6:35:15| again, bear in mind that that's an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23715)|
| 6:35:17| That's not set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23717)|
| 6:35:19| Right. You don't even know the interest rate yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23719)|
| 6:35:21| until you go to the market. No. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23721)|
| 6:35:23| again, I think I would be fairly close at 2.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23723)|
| 6:35:25| I mean, it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23725)|
| 6:35:27| 2.2. It might be 2. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23727)|
| 6:35:29| I don't think it's going to go to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23729)|
| 6:35:31| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23731)|
| 6:35:33| but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23733)|
| 6:35:35| and, again, that's done. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23735)|
| 6:35:37| an estimate. And we've kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23737)|
| 6:35:39| shown you the estimate of what this is going to be over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23739)|
| 6:35:41| the next 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23741)|
| 6:35:43| well, basically up to 2033.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23743)|
| 6:35:45| The other phrase you stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23745)|
| 6:35:47| was that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23747)|
| 6:35:49| I'm going to put words in your mouth because I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23749)|
| 6:35:51| words you actually used, but that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23751)|
| 6:35:53| was sort of a statement of intent. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23753)|
| 6:35:55| until you actually design the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23755)|
| 6:35:57| bond issue, you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23757)|
| 6:35:59| know how much you're going to the market for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23759)|
| 6:36:01| So, if that is true, and that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23761)|
| 6:36:03| premise, if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23763)|
| 6:36:05| for example, George wanted a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23765)|
| 6:36:07| next year, you could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23767)|
| 6:36:09| for that. You'd have a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23769)|
| 6:36:11| and another statement of intent. And you'd go for either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23771)|
| 6:36:13| more money or a different allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23773)|
| 6:36:15| of the same money. Isn't that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23775)|
| 6:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23777)|
| 6:36:19| Let me tell you what a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23779)|
| 6:36:21| resolution of intent is. And a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23781)|
| 6:36:23| of intent is, let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23783)|
| 6:36:25| that we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23785)|
| 6:36:27| and I'll use Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23787)|
| 6:36:29| as an example, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23789)|
| 6:36:31| the state turns it over to us in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23791)|
| 6:36:33| reasonable period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23793)|
| 6:36:35| and we're going to start, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23795)|
| 6:36:37| tearing down buildings here within the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23797)|
| 6:36:39| six months. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23799)|
| 6:36:41| and again, we already know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23801)|
| 6:36:43| that this bond issue is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23803)|
| 6:36:45| to take longer than six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23805)|
| 6:36:47| but we may come back to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23807)|
| 6:36:49| with what we call a resolution of intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23809)|
| 6:36:51| that says that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23811)|
| 6:36:53| will internally fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23813)|
| 6:36:55| the demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23815)|
| 6:36:57| work on Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23817)|
| 6:36:59| Park with the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23819)|
| 6:37:01| of repaying ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23821)|
| 6:37:03| from the proceeds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23823)|
| 6:37:05| a future bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23825)|
| 6:37:07| Now, and again, we would be very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23827)|
| 6:37:09| in that resolution of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23829)|
| 6:37:11| Now, again, a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23831)|
| 6:37:13| when we go to the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23833)|
| 6:37:15| we've already said that we're going to repay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23835)|
| 6:37:17| ourselves with that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23837)|
| 6:37:19| But the total amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23839)|
| 6:37:21| of the bond issue could change at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23841)|
| 6:37:23| in time because just other circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23843)|
| 6:37:25| have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23845)|
| 6:37:27| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23847)|
| 6:37:29| I mean, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23849)|
| 6:37:31| it may appear that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23851)|
| 6:37:33| trying to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23853)|
| 6:37:35| you know, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23855)|
| 6:37:37| skate on ice or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23857)|
| 6:37:39| but these numbers will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23859)|
| 6:37:41| all change. It won't look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23861)|
| 6:37:43| 31.4, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23863)|
| 6:37:45| we're trying to, you know, once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23865)|
| 6:37:47| actually put the deal together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23867)|
| 6:37:49| but, you know, you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23869)|
| 6:37:51| at is that our intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23871)|
| 6:37:53| to fund these projects at roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23873)|
| 6:37:55| 30, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23875)|
| 6:37:57| And again, what we're going to submit in cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23877)|
| 6:37:59| is probably close to 31.4, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23879)|
| 6:38:01| the bond issue is going to look totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23881)|
| 6:38:03| But to go back to the point, you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23883)|
| 6:38:05| foreclosed from adding an additional project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23885)|
| 6:38:07| mid-year. Now, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23887)|
| 6:38:09| you're not foreclosed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23889)|
| 6:38:11| but once I bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23891)|
| 6:38:13| an initial resolution for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23893)|
| 6:38:15| to issue bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23895)|
| 6:38:17| that becomes your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23897)|
| 6:38:19| that becomes, then you're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23899)|
| 6:38:21| starting to set it in stone at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23901)|
| 6:38:23| That's the legal document that governs the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23903)|
| 6:38:25| Let us go to Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23905)|
| 6:38:27| I think I'm trying to ask the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23907)|
| 6:38:29| question that Dwayne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23909)|
| 6:38:31| and now Nick asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23911)|
| 6:38:33| When we do this, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23913)|
| 6:38:35| essentially saying, okay, we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23915)|
| 6:38:37| this outline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23917)|
| 6:38:39| That's correct. But, in fact, if we chose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23919)|
| 6:38:41| to do a parking garage instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23921)|
| 6:38:43| a whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23923)|
| 6:38:45| that we could substitute that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23925)|
| 6:38:47| So, but this is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23927)|
| 6:38:49| initial intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23929)|
| 6:38:51| But until you go to the market, that's not set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23931)|
| 6:38:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23933)|
| 6:38:55| Until you actually go to the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23935)|
| 6:38:57| and, again, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23937)|
| 6:38:59| have to bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23939)|
| 6:39:01| now that's called a different legal term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23941)|
| 6:39:03| we will have to bring an initial resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23943)|
| 6:39:05| to Council before we issue any debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23945)|
| 6:39:07| And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23947)|
| 6:39:09| really starts tying all these numbers down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23949)|
| 6:39:11| It will have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23951)|
| 6:39:13| flexibility in, but it will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23953)|
| 6:39:15| well, it's not to exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23955)|
| 6:39:17| X dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23957)|
| 6:39:19| And it will say it will be for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23959)|
| 6:39:21| or, you know, however we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23961)|
| 6:39:23| structure the amortization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23963)|
| 6:39:25| And it will become, you know, it will have a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23965)|
| 6:39:27| bit of room in there, but it won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23967)|
| 6:39:29| have as much room there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23969)|
| 6:39:31| Now, prior to that date, yeah, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23971)|
| 6:39:33| flexibility. You could say instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23973)|
| 6:39:35| a 31.4, it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23975)|
| 6:39:37| 35, it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23977)|
| 6:39:39| 40, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23979)|
| 6:39:41| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23981)|
| 6:39:43| But what Council passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23983)|
| 6:39:45| as far as a capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23985)|
| 6:39:47| has to go along with the five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23987)|
| 6:39:49| plan projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23989)|
| 6:39:51| You can't create projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23991)|
| 6:39:53| Let me tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23993)|
| 6:39:55| this. If we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23995)|
| 6:39:57| have a parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23997)|
| 6:39:59| garage set out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=23999)|
| 6:40:01| capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24001)|
| 6:40:03| the six-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24003)|
| 6:40:05| horizon. Now, we can shift things around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24005)|
| 6:40:07| within that six-year horizon, but if it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24007)|
| 6:40:09| not in that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24009)|
| 6:40:11| we will have to basically start a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24011)|
| 6:40:13| process over and go through MPC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24013)|
| 6:40:15| all that. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24015)|
| 6:40:17| I don't recall a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24017)|
| 6:40:19| parking garage in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24019)|
| 6:40:21| plan. Now, again, it's been a while since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24021)|
| 6:40:23| I looked at it. I don't have that document with me, but I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24023)|
| 6:40:25| There is not one. I'm sure there is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24025)|
| 6:40:27| one in the plan, though I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24027)|
| 6:40:29| we envision a parking garage that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24029)|
| 6:40:31| we would put in maybe next year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24031)|
| 6:40:33| plan because it's way out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24033)|
| 6:40:35| some. And I also want to add one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24035)|
| 6:40:37| We are envisioning a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24037)|
| 6:40:39| somehow on Cumberland, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24039)|
| 6:40:41| we're envisioning a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24041)|
| 6:40:43| financing mechanism that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24043)|
| 6:40:45| has certain advantages, at least right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24045)|
| 6:40:47| which is having it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24047)|
| 6:40:49| repaid out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24049)|
| 6:40:51| TIF district in that area, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24051)|
| 6:40:53| would use those new taxes and not go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24053)|
| 6:40:55| taking up our debt capacity. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24055)|
| 6:40:57| with that being said, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24057)|
| 6:40:59| we're certainly open to vetting new projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24059)|
| 6:41:01| We think these seem to be the ones we'd like to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24061)|
| 6:41:03| commitment to go forward on for a variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24063)|
| 6:41:05| of reasons that you've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24065)|
| 6:41:07| I think. But going back to that idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24067)|
| 6:41:09| we run a six-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24069)|
| 6:41:11| plan, the word plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24071)|
| 6:41:13| through MPC, get their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24073)|
| 6:41:15| advice, and then we budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24075)|
| 6:41:17| the first year of it. We budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24077)|
| 6:41:19| The word plan and budget are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24079)|
| 6:41:21| Well, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24081)|
| 6:41:23| they run sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24083)|
| 6:41:25| concurrently, and as they all come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24085)|
| 6:41:27| we put together the first year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24087)|
| 6:41:29| The first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24089)|
| 6:41:31| of that six-year capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24091)|
| 6:41:33| plan mirrors what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24093)|
| 6:41:35| we have proposed as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24095)|
| 6:41:37| of the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24097)|
| 6:41:39| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24099)|
| 6:41:41| going forward...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24101)|
| 6:41:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24103)|
| 6:41:45| And then, now, going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24105)|
| 6:41:47| forward, you may have something out in year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24107)|
| 6:41:49| three that we decide to move up to year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24109)|
| 6:41:51| two, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24111)|
| 6:41:53| we, you know, the more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24113)|
| 6:41:55| scenario is we have some things in year two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24115)|
| 6:41:57| that we decide we can't fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24117)|
| 6:41:59| next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24119)|
| 6:42:01| But what you can't do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24121)|
| 6:42:03| just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24123)|
| 6:42:05| well, all of a sudden I thought of a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24125)|
| 6:42:07| project that is not anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24127)|
| 6:42:09| in the six-year plan, and come back to us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24129)|
| 6:42:11| you know, stick that in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24131)|
| 6:42:13| because that's not a permissible use without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24133)|
| 6:42:15| going back through the MPC process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24135)|
| 6:42:17| And evaluating it in the logical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24137)|
| 6:42:19| planning sense and everything else, air it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24139)|
| 6:42:21| out publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24141)|
| 6:42:23| Bill, do you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24143)|
| 6:42:25| closing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24145)|
| 6:42:29| I'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24149)|
| 6:42:31| no, I really don't. I think I said what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24151)|
| 6:42:33| needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24153)|
| 6:42:35| Thank you. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24155)|
| 6:42:37| quickly, just so we're all on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24157)|
| 6:42:39| on the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24159)|
| 6:42:41| and I met with Mr. York about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24161)|
| 6:42:43| it, and please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24163)|
| 6:42:45| correct me, I'm going to throw out some numbers here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24165)|
| 6:42:47| and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24167)|
| 6:42:49| but every year we're required to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24169)|
| 6:42:51| contribution, and in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24171)|
| 6:42:53| 12-13 budget, that contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24173)|
| 6:42:55| is roughly $14.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24175)|
| 6:42:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24177)|
| 6:42:59| And the required contribution for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24179)|
| 6:43:05| 13-14 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24185)|
| 6:43:07| is over $22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24187)|
| 6:43:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24189)|
| 6:43:11| Roughly $22.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24191)|
| 6:43:13| $22.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24193)|
| 6:43:15| And the way we're paying for that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24195)|
| 6:43:17| $13 million is coming out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24197)|
| 6:43:19| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24199)|
| 6:43:21| 13-14 budget, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24201)|
| 6:43:23| $6 million is coming out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24203)|
| 6:43:25| basically fund balance that we took out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24205)|
| 6:43:27| last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24207)|
| 6:43:29| $10 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24209)|
| 6:43:31| The $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24211)|
| 6:43:33| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24213)|
| 6:43:35| that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24215)|
| 6:43:37| very quick and dirty. I'll use different terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24217)|
| 6:43:39| but that's a quick and dirty synopsis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24219)|
| 6:43:41| So a couple of observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24221)|
| 6:43:43| The total budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24223)|
| 6:43:45| increased from $180 to $183,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24225)|
| 6:43:47| where our pension obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24227)|
| 6:43:49| increased from $14.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24229)|
| 6:43:51| to over $22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24231)|
| 6:43:53| So without that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24233)|
| 6:43:55| money being taken out of fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24235)|
| 6:43:57| last year, we would be looking at significant cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24237)|
| 6:43:59| tax increases, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24239)|
| 6:44:01| taking the money out of fund balance this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24241)|
| 6:44:03| So I just think that's important. I think it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24243)|
| 6:44:05| we're all on the same page. We all understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24245)|
| 6:44:07| this obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24247)|
| 6:44:09| going forward, and we talked with constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24249)|
| 6:44:11| that while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24251)|
| 6:44:13| coming out of this budget is only $16 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24253)|
| 6:44:15| our actual contribution this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24255)|
| 6:44:17| to the pension is $22.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24257)|
| 6:44:19| So I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24259)|
| 6:44:21| to make sure everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24261)|
| 6:44:23| on this council understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24263)|
| 6:44:25| As Mr. York said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24265)|
| 6:44:27| earlier, it's the elephant in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24267)|
| 6:44:29| and it's going to be a challenge moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=24269)|
