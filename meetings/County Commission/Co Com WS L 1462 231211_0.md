| 0:10:25| And here's a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| And commissioners, if you wouldn't mind, we would like to do a photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=627)|

| 0:12:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Before we get to public forum, just a moment of privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| Our superintendent, Mr. Reiswick, gave us these annual reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| And I love the title, KCS Reimagined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| And without objection, I'd like him to just come forward for just two or three minutes, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| and give us a quick rundown about what's going on with Knox County Schools and looking to our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=754)|
| 0:12:52| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| I need your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| John Reiswick, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| So, we're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| And thanks for letting us share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| That's our annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| To my knowledge, I don't think we've ever done one of those in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| So, it's just important for us to, you know, we continue to say we're really about four things that are our four priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| that we think Knox County Schools is uniquely positioned to do as a school system in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| Again, we understand we're not the full community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| We're just a piece of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| But we are charged with raising the next generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| So, for us, it's really about excellence and foundational skills, and that really talks about early literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| and those skills leading up to Algebra I and proficiency there because working with the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| five of the top ten jobs for the future will be STEM-related jobs in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| So, that's a focus of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Second is our great educators, and that's both our teachers that really are the face of everything that we do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| They're the ones who teach the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| They're the ones who respond back to our parents and interact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| And then also the principals that run those schools because without good leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| it's easy to go astray and not know what you're focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| So, that's kind of our great educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| When we focus on our college and career readiness aspect of that, that's really talking about what we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| core to our mission is we understand if we're not getting students ready for life after graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| there's no one else who else is doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| So, for us, that's a lot of focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| A lot of you are familiar with the 865 work that we're doing to reimagine our high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| really bring business into our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| I know this past year we've had over 340 businesses that have come in and been part of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| and that's kind of three ways for us for our freshman academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| They come in and they speak as guest speakers just to expose these students to kind of local businesses that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| The sophomore year is when they begin to do field trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| and they actually go out to different places of business to see what that looks like and be exposed to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| We don't have any yet in this, but junior and senior year, they'll hopefully get internships and move into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| as well as our teachers have had externships, and that's kind of been fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| You know, teachers often get asked when will I ever use this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| and so we've been able to get them out to some different businesses, to UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| I know they were able to go to the simulation labs and teachers spend some time and do some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| So, I've been really received by the local business because our goal is that they all stay in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| and, again, are the next generation and the workers and know what employers are out there for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| And then finally, our final priority is success for every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| and that really just kind of acknowledges that all students, you know, they're not widgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| They don't start at the same place. They all have different challenges, different backgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| and it's really our job to try to shore those up and to get students those obstacles to their learning removed as fast as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| If it's a language barrier, if it's a special needs barrier, if it's different kind of mental health challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| that we have supports in place for all those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| So, for us, it's really just a focus in there and making sure that we're moving toward that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| and there's lots of metrics in there that we've tried to hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| We've had a great year this year thanks to our teachers and principals, one we're probably most proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| A lot's been talked about third grade reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Our third grade proficiency was the highest it's ever been in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| We're at 43.3% of our third graders proficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| Again, a lot of work from parents, a lot of work for teachers, a lot of work from principals to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| We're really excited about that just as we're moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| but it's kind of hard to believe like we've kind of been in for 18 months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| It doesn't seem like it's been that long, but we're just getting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| So, we've got a lot of new initiatives, too, that we're launching out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| You'll hear some of those things coming up this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| We're doing a literacy deep dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Dr. Wilson's leading that for us, really just to try to get a baseline of where we are in literacy across the board in all 50 of our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| You'll hear an initiative that we're going to launch for a recruitment effort that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| We're working right now to get that built, and I'll hold the name on that one so Ms. Semble-Garn can introduce that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| We're doing a facilities assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| It's been a long time since we've done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| so we want to make sure when we come and talk about what needs to be done on our fiscal management side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Dr. Adams is leading that for us, that we actually have a long-term plan that we're looking and working off of with data to prove that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| as well as a salary study, again, that Ms. Semble-Garn is leading for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| so that we make sure that our salaries are competitive market-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Thanks to you all and the commission's support, third year in a row, we've been able to do a 4% raise for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| That was a big highlight, and we have a continued commitment to do that in future years, as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| and trying to be fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| I know we're getting ready to go into budget season, and I know my assistant superintendents were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| We're going to have a lot of conversations in January about budget justifications that are aligned to these priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| Our goal is to do what we can with the money we have before we ask for more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| and so that's always been a focus of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| We'll continue to do that, so we're real excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Again, I feel like we're just getting started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| but this will give you a little look into kind of the work that we've been doing as a school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| and again, I appreciate the commission and your all support of education across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Thanks very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Did anybody have any brief questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| Thank you so much, John, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| We're very proud of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| Moving on to public forum, our first speaker is Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| Mike is addressing agenda item 55, which has been deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| but since it was listed on the agenda, I'm letting him go ahead and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1087)|
| 0:18:18| I missed that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Mike Arms, 201 Ivy Gate Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37933.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| I'm here as Knox County's designee to the LCUB board, and also just a little insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1106)|
| 0:18:35| Our company serves as executive director for the Association of Tennessee Valley Governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| so I've worked with utilities in 200 counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| and the point I want to make about this ordinance 55 is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| I read it, the LCUB folks read it, and felt like there's an unusual amount of onus put on the two utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1131)|
| 0:19:00| So the utilities were asked for their positions and submitted a lot of comments in a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1140)|
| 0:19:11| and then on December the 4th, when the ordinance was finalized for this session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| it went back to these utilities, and they couldn't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| None of their comments were considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| And if you read this ordinance, you'll see that some of the statements in there now are just outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1166)|
| 0:19:35| So just a little background on LCUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| They have about 20,000 poles in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| I'm not here speaking for KUB, but I know they have about 50,000 poles outside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| You're talking about 70,000 poles outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| If you read this ordinance, you would think that maybe danger poles and damage poles are issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1196)|
| 0:20:04| If you talk to Mr. Snowden, you'll realize that any danger or dangerous pole that's identified is removed within 24 hours and replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1204)|
| 0:20:15| I know Commissioner Oster had an issue with a pole that may have caused a visual problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| and she contacted LCUB, and LCUB had that pole removed working with the owners of the attachment within a matter of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1222)|
| 0:20:34| So when we move forward on this ordinance, if you decide to move forward, I know it's still 60 days away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| I can tell you that your engineering department will have to spend exorbitant time working with the telecommunications folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1241)|
| 0:20:51| and the utilities to come up with something that's workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| And when I go back and look at the tone set in this ordinance, and I'll give you an example straight from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1257)|
| 0:21:16| There's a section that basically says that a utility can be basically banned from doing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1276)|
| 0:21:25| its permits taken away, no longer allowed to apply for new permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| Now think about that, Commissioner Schoonmaker, for your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| That would mean that new school we're talking about in Farragut would have to have a lot of solar panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| And Chairman Hill, I know we could control development in Horn Valley if LCUB wasn't allowed to work there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1301)|
| 0:21:50| The real issue when I look at this is a simple fact that rates, electric rates, are composed in the aggregate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1310)|
| 0:22:01| which means any dollars that a utility spends, and this is a 254 utilities throughout the valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1321)|
| 0:22:10| the rate dollars have to be distributed among all rate payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| So any dollars that this commission wants LCUB or KUB to spend on this issue will be paid for by Roane County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1336)|
| 0:22:27| you can discuss that with Roane County Commission, Anderson County, Lowndon County, Granger County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| and for Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4, all your city residents will be paying for this work to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| although it's outside your jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| What also bothered me about this ordinance was the person who appoints the KUB board sits in this very building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1364)|
| 0:22:52| I know no one approached the LCUB board and said, we have an issue, let's work together to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| I've checked, no one went to the KUB board and said, we have an issue, let's solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| I think a better resolution would be, instead of an ordinance, would be a resolution asking for all the telecoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| and all the utilities to maybe start bi-monthly meetings in how we resolve this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| but I'll tell you this, it can't be resolved by January the 1st, 2026.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| And I know this, LCUB replaces 3,000 poles a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| It's not that this problem is being ignored, but if you think you're going to solve it in two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| and start penalizing people $1,000 a day for a pole, you're going to have some upset utility members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| Could you wrap it up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| I'm wrapping it up right now. Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Merry Christmas. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| I do see a light since we have allowed a speaker to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| Something's not on the agenda. We will allow a public forum from commission comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| First, I'd just like to say that there's a reason that this has already been deferred until February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| and I find it a little disingenuous that Mr. Arms wouldn't give you the whole facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| which were not only we had two meetings with all of the telecoms who showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| we issued a new ordinance, I think it was this morning, based upon many of those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1461)|
| 0:24:28| Another meeting is scheduled for Monday the 18th with all of the telecom who wish to participate and show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| and another meeting is set for January to also come together to find ways to do a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| which is why it is moved forward to February, and it is not in final form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| So I don't think it's appropriate to debate something that isn't in final form that is being worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| and that's specifically why I put it forward to be delayed a few months and to continue to find a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| And I won't speak to the merits of the ordinance until it's presented in final form, and we'll do that down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Thank you. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Seeing no other lights, our next public speaker is Tina Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| Is Tina here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1516)|
| 0:25:32| Ms. Sparks is speaking to Item 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| Please give us your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| You'll have five minutes to speak, Ms. Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1539)|
| 0:25:48| My name is Tina Sparks, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| So the Item 25, I came when I was filling out online that I wanted to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1554)|
| 0:26:07| You have the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| You have for, against, or neutral, and I clicked on neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1569)|
| 0:26:19| That's because this item refers to the agreement that the Knox County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1579)|
| 0:26:34| and Helen Ross McNabb have already entered into or have entered into back in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| And so today, this item, Item Number 25, has to do with how much the services are going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1602)|
| 0:26:53| And that's the way I understood this to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| Let's see, for the pricing for evaluation and for CIT, critical intervention training, and for fitness of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1618)|
| 0:27:17| So it's $414 for the evaluation to see if the person is up to doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1637)|
| 0:27:29| And the fitness of duty, $1,028.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| And the crisis services intervention, $85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| So that doesn't sound like a whole lot of money, and it's probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| But we need to remember what this money is being used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1666)|
| 0:27:54| It's for the entire Knox County Sheriff's Department correction facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1674)|
| 0:28:04| I would say the officers in the school, the resource officers, if they are having difficulties of any type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1684)|
| 0:28:16| Now let me say one thing very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| I am in total, total agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| Our law enforcement, both Knox County Sheriff and KPD, they operate under a stress level that I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1704)|
| 0:28:35| And I don't think any of you have it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| I can't even imagine what they go through every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| That being said, that is their job that they have, that is their job that they have trained for and aspired to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1724)|
| 0:28:54| And so they do need these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| So I just want to make sure that I understand this item correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| that it applies to all of Knox County law enforcement in the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| And when you go on the Sheriff's Department website, you can see the divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| And one of the divisions is juvenile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| And I think that this money that's going to be spent to help evaluate, train, counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1768)|
| 0:29:40| must, must also include evaluation, training, and counsel to the folk at the Richard L. Bean Juvenile Detention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1780)|
| 0:29:54| They, too, operate under a lot of stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| The children in their charge, the children in their charge, a lot of stress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| something that we would never know anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| So I just want to make it clear that this money is going to be spent for this training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1811)|
| 0:30:19| and for this group of people, the law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| And I think it's a KPD, Knox County, they all will benefit from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1825)|
| 0:30:33| But I want to make sure that the Richard L. Bean Juvenile Detention Center is part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| because there are some folk there that really need some counseling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| that really need maybe to go back and have some more training, that need evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| And that evaluation, I think, can come from you all, can come from our county mayor, can come from Judge Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1855)|
| 0:31:09| These are folk from John Valiant and the other trustee, board trustee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1869)|
| 0:31:17| This is important that we recognize these folk and we ask them to please do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| Please do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| We also have a second speaker also on item number 25, Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1897)|
| 0:31:47| Is Mr. Roach here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Mr. Roach, as you're coming forward, if you'd please give us your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| and I'll give you five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1914)|

| 0:32:01| Item number 25 references, of course, as has been stated, mental health services and contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| between Helen Wrestling Lab and Knox County Sheriff's Department specifically, as I can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1928)|
| 0:32:17| And again, I'm going to go straight to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Under Knox County Sheriff's Department, we have a situation with the Richard L. Beans Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1940)|
| 0:32:31| Juvenile Detention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| It has not gotten Knox County any great publicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| We've had everyone from the county mayor to the chairman of the trustee board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1959)|
| 0:32:47| to Judge Irwin, juvenile court judge, literally make excuses that came out of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1967)|
| 0:32:57| I've heard the audio of the interview that was done with Richard L. Bean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| And I'll say this, I find it real strange that, you know, you have Richard L. Bean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| as still the superintendent of the Richard L. Bean Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| Retire him and then name the center after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| He's done that great a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Obviously, he has not done that great a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| And no one wants to take responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| How do we get that man out of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| Beans say he's done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| He needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| He needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| I don't care how it's done, but he needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| Sheriff's Department, trustee board, county mayor, juvenile court judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| I think you guys may have had some type of informational meeting with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| about some of this maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| And did you – could anyone speak to that about what you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| the top to bottom responsibilities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| and who has purview over this, in this case, this man?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| Because if any of you have heard that interview that he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| you would understand that there's something – there's a disconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| There's a disconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| And it should be spoken to and addressed first by you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| and next by any other administrative officials who have purview over his position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| But I don't think that's going to happen because time and again we have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| how county commission has let things just slip through the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| And the word is, yes, he can't be touched because he's been there so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| and he's, quote, done so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Oh, and we make excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Well, he has a certain way of talking to people and he's got this great heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| or whatever, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| When you say some of the stuff that he said, go back and listen to the NPR report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| You can get it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Listen to the four-minute interview that he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| And you can just – I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| It takes good old boy to a different level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| And it's shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| It's shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| It's shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| And yet we have John Valiant making excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| Making excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| And I don't care to go into the process of how he was appointed as chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| or to the trustee board that's now chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| I don't want to even address that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| But I'm telling you guys, there has to be some accountability at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2153)|
| 0:36:01| And if you guys don't do it, if you all don't start, make a phone call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| have a heart-to-heart conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| I don't know if you already have or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| But I'm not seeing any results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| I don't think most of Knox County is seeing any results of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| because that was a shameful thing that he felt so relaxed that he could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| what he said in the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Even in jest, you don't talk like that about young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| and about what you've been doing with those young people over 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| It's shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| And you all should be ashamed for letting it go on this long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| continuing that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2195)|

| 0:41:53| To my understanding, this is a committee that meets once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Speaking to Commissioner Durrett, are you currently on this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Yes, ma'am, I am currently on this committee, but we have met once since I have been on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Is there anyone that would like to have their name proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| I see Commissioner Jay, I see Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| Are there any others that would be interested in serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| Can I just make a comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| You certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| I think the reason that the committee has not met is there's an interim Senior Vice Chancellor of Finance, Alan Bolton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2551)|
| 0:42:41| and I'm not sure they're aware they need to have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| And I think that's why the last two years we haven't had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| But it goes back to the initial agreement when we were involved with the building of Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2572)|
| 0:43:01| So I guess maybe the law department can find out what the requirements are if there is supposed to be a yearly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2581)|
| 0:43:12| because they've not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| And one of the other people that is still involved with that, that used to organize the meeting, Sarah Hull,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2595)|
| 0:43:23| she's still in that department, but we haven't heard anything from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| Lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| January 1st, the Tennessee Athletics Department will be taking over Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| So there's going to be new management at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| So whoever's on this board probably needs to reach out to see what their focus is, what they want to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| But it's going to change come January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| Athletics takes over Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| I would like to move that we approve this resolution appointing Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Lee to the Arena Use Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Commissioner Jay, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Yeah, I'd like to serve on the committee just to figure out what it does and why we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| Since I think my very first year here, we dug into the details, and the whole reason for the committee was Knox County was one of three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2666)|
| 0:44:36| the bonds to pay for Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| And after the bonds were paid off after 20 years, which they were paid off after 20 years, the agreement went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| We ended up being just a guarantor of the debt but never had to pay anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| And the whole process went away, but somehow the committee just stayed in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| So I'm happy to learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| I think ultimately I'd like to go to the Rules Committee unless there's some we don't manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| We don't own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| We don't operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| We don't program it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| It's not in our purview and jurisdiction, but I'll learn more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| And if it continues to be something that doesn't seem of value to this commission, I probably will go to the Rules Committee and ask for it just to be dissolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2714)|
| 0:45:22| because I think it's just one additional thing we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| But I'm happy to learn more before that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you, Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Then we'll trust that you will find some answers and bring it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| We have a proper motion and second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| Seeing no further lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2742)|

| 0:46:07| I do have a commissioner wanting to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| May I have a motion to approve or move forward without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2770)|

| 0:46:47| I think this will be a great addition to East Knox County for connectivity and just safe navigation because those schools are close together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2807)|
| 0:46:56| but they're far enough apart and the ballpark is right there in the middle of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| I think anything that comes to safety within our school zones is worth the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2822)|

| 0:48:19| It gives us the ability to request funds, to implement a comprehensive preventive maintenance plan based on the information that we got from our consultant, Kimberly Horn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2899)|
| 0:48:34| also feedback that we got from the public during our public engagement sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| The idea behind the plan is to basically use this document when we submit requests for grants, as we submit additional funding requests for capital projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2921)|
| 0:48:56| and as with regards to long-term improvements, but also in the short term, the plan will be used to address those things or those issues that are currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2936)|
| 0:49:13| we see them as low-hanging fruit in our parks, things that we can get taken care of immediately, a way to put it in one central location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2953)|
| 0:49:21| utilizing our preventive maintenance software system to get these things done instead of watching parks deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2961)|
| 0:49:35| We'll have a plan to actually go out and maintain and improve plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| Thank you. Thank you. That was what I gathered out of it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| It was very interesting, some of the easier things that appeared to be identified that would not be very costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| And it was also no surprise, but I hated to see in writing that we have too few employees and not enough dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| I do hope we can work toward that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| Are there any other comments? Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| Thank you, Madam Chair. I had the great pleasure of serving on the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| and we have a great group of people that come together monthly and talk about the big picture on parks and work with Director Mack and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3016)|
| 0:50:25| And I know this master plan, I think it's the first time we've done one, or it's the first time we've done one in a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| The current plan is 11 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| So it's like most of our other plans. It's a bit overdue, but a lot of work went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| It's at least a good roadmap, and we do have a lot of challenges. I'm willing to offer a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| Thank you. We have a motion by Jay. Commissioner, do I have a second on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3049)|
| 0:50:57| Second by Beeler. Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| Thank you, Madam Chair. I kind of was scrolling through this 198-page document as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3062)|
| 0:51:09| and I just found one typo, which I thought was interesting, that on page 99, I'm credited in my district for having the Corrington Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3069)|
| 0:51:21| Oh. We can fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| The numbers, I think, just got flipped someplace. But anyways, well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| And if we have specific questions about our own commission district with some of the assets in those, we can address that directly with you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3093)|
| 0:51:43| Yes, sir, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| Commissioner Jay, did you have another comment? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| Commissioner Jay, was your motion for approval or without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| It's approval if there's not any objection, if people want more time to push until next week, but I didn't see any reason that we couldn't move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| All right. Approve, not move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Motion to approve by Jay, second by Beeler. Seeing no other likes, all those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| Opposed? Motion carries. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| Item number 35, resolution 703, approving the adoption of the Knox County Parks and Recreation fee schedule, effective January 1st, 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3136)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you. Director Mack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| Oh, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Address the fee schedule, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Yes, ma'am, I will. Let me bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| So it's been quite a while since the fees in Parks and Recreation have been adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3157)|
| 0:52:45| As most of you know, in 2020, we saw a large increase in the cost related to materials and equipment, and we saw that across the board, and we didn't escape that in Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3165)|
| 0:53:01| So part of this new fee schedule addresses those increases in cost with regards to equipment and material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3181)|
| 0:53:11| Usage has not gone down, so in order for us to continue to provide services and facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3191)|
| 0:53:22| we see the need for these small, and they're relatively small, increases, as you can see from the fee schedule, in particular with our golf services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3202)|
| 0:53:33| All right. Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Thank you, Madam Chair. When it says on the list the current fee, is that, what kind of a time period does that go back to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3216)|
| 0:53:45| So that's the existing fee as of today. So that current is what we charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| Right, but was that the same last year and the previous year and the previous year to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| What I'm getting at is most of these you have not raised the rates on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| Right. We haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| That's what I'm concerned about, is if we haven't raised rates in five years or ten years, does it not make sense to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| Because some of the areas, though, we didn't see the need to raise those because we feel as though we want to provide a service, but we want to also make it affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3249)|
| 0:54:20| So we want to keep the cost down as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| And the areas where we absolutely had to is the areas where we actually raised the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| So you'll see a lot of the fees did not get raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Yeah. It looks like kind of most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| All right. Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Motion by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Second by Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| Seeing no other lights for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| Item number 42, Resolution 901, Approving an Economic Impact Plan for Tax Increment Financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3298)|
| 0:55:06| Submitted by the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox in connection with a multi-use development known as Prosperity Crossing, located off El Camino Lane in Knox County, Tennessee, near the Watt Road Interchange on I-4075.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3306)|
| 0:55:23| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| Motion to move forward by Jay. Second by Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| I'm sorry. Motion by Schoonmaker. Second by Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| Is that correct? I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| To move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3347)|
| 0:56:00| Did you have something? Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| All right. Seeing no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Item number 44, Resolution 903, Approving the Amendment and Restatement of the Sheriff's Total Accumulation Retirement Plan and the Knox County Employee Benefit System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3373)|
| 0:56:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| Motion by Jay. Second by Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| To move forward with approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| I believe I saw Jennifer Schroeder here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| Is she still present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| Would you just come forward briefly and just address this for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| You've been so kind to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| So the for commission approval, we have changing the vesting of the star plan, which is the sheriff's total accumulation retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3416)|
| 0:57:08| Currently, it has a 10 and a 15 year cliff vesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| And the amendment is to change it to a five year graded vesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| What would be similar and mimic the asset accumulation plan, which the other county employees have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| Also, we also wanted to add a 457 match, which isn't the same as the asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| So after five years of service, you get an additional 2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| After 10, another 2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| And after 15 years, another 2 percent county match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| The other part of the amendment is to amend the employee benefit system to allow participation in Merck for star employees and UOP employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3461)|
| 0:57:52| And these amendments will help with retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| They'll also help prepare the employees for retirement so that they can retire when they're eligible and have the funds and also to save for medical costs, possibly when they retire as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3476)|
| 0:58:10| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Director Caldwell, did you? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| Several of us are on the retirement board and have heard quite a bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| It is more to make it an even playing field, so to speak, and benefits across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Chris, is this a wash or is this a benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| How is this helping not only the employee but maybe the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3517)|
| 0:58:44| So there is a minimal cost that the actuary calculated for us that we will absorb in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3524)|
| 0:58:54| But it basically just gets their goal was to get the officers who are on star more equal to what we do in the asset accumulation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3534)|
| 0:59:08| It's really minor as far as a cost standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| This is for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| According to the letter that we got from the esteemed Bob Cross, so it says $615,000 per year, and does that go up every year after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3561)|
| 0:59:35| I'm just trying to find a number when you said it's gone up, and I'm just looking at some of the documents quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| What's the fiscal note?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3582)|
| 0:59:52| Or is it $515,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| I do see Mr. Cross, if you'd like to also come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| There were two costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| One, so STAR had two retirement pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| They had their base, which was a 10-year vesting, and then they had a supplemental piece, which is closed, which was a 15-year vesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3605)|
| 1:00:13| And so to vest them January 1 at five years, this is the actuarial cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| Because as employees leave, you have forfeitures to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| So that's what the actuary calculated those costs at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| So, Chris, what will it do for the budget for next year based on these changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| So ultimately there will be an increase in the benefits piece of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| We will use his estimate until we have actual figures to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3642)|
| 1:00:50| And so ultimately it's going to come down to how many of the employees take advantage of what we're offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| And so we know historically what county employees have done and what percentage they have taken advantage of our MERP and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3657)|
| 1:01:09| And so we have to see what their participation rate is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| To your question, though, as well, as salary increases happen, those costs will go up as well because they're a portion of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3673)|
| 1:01:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion for approval by Jay, seconded by Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| Item number 47, Resolution 906, Approving an Amendment to the Knox County Sheriff's Office Employees' Merit System Rules and Regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3699)|
| 1:01:48| in Rule 3.2.F to Narrow Restrictions on Board Members' Political Activities to Apply Exclusively to Elections for Knox County Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3708)|
| 1:02:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| Mr. Commissioner Jay, you had asked to have this pulled for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| Was there anything you'd like to speak to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| Sorry, I hit the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| I'd make a motion to deny based upon the following reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| Many of you all know I've worked on this for years and years and years, and I want to remind everybody that the merit system, the purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3740)|
| 1:02:31| the original purpose of the merit system, which we've had for 30-plus years, is to protect our officers from political retribution when new sheriffs come and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3751)|
| 1:02:48| and a myriad of other protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| It is for the officers, and many of you all have reiterated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| I think it's a great thing for us to always keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| This is a program, I mean, this is a body that is focused on protecting our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| The restriction of political activity of the board members, not the officers, was a reform I put into place, I guess it was about a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3785)|
| 1:03:15| started working on it several years before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| And the goal was to remove as much politics from this quasi-judicial board that does have direct authority in determining grievances and things that affect the livelihoods of our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3798)|
| 1:03:36| and the life and the livelihoods of our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| And so the first question I'll ask everybody to just keep in mind as you consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| Well, I'm sorry, Madam Chair, there may not have been a second, so I don't know if I should start a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Do we have a second to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| I jumped into the discussion before I had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| A proper motion on the floor to deny made by Commissioner Jay, seconded by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| I'll continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| So the first question I would like everybody to just keep in mind is this has been in place for about a year and a half or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3857)|
| 1:04:26| What is now broken that is in need of fixing that would warrant changing this ordinance and this rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| What's broken today for the protection of our officers that needs to be amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| Just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| The second question, and I think this is the most important question, how does changing this rule benefit our officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3880)|
| 1:04:49| That is the most important question in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| The origin of the merit system was to protect our officers from political influence or retribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| And so how does allowing more politics into this quasi-judicial board help our officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| I haven't yet gotten an answer from anyone in having this to come today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| And then I want you to consider a real-world political situation that could happen almost immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| Assume this is passed and this board, the merit system board, can be involved in any political race that they want minus the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3916)|
| 1:05:26| That would include county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| And we have county commission elections literally right around the corner in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| We have one candidate who's already filed to run for District 5 commission seat, Mr. Hall, who is also an employee of the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3935)|
| 1:05:46| Imagine he runs for commission and somebody from the merit council board gets very involved with the political race but with his opponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3946)|
| 1:05:56| And they run and Mr. Hall runs and Bob Smith runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| And Bob Smith is being completely supported and promoted and raising money for by one of the board members of the merit council, which would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3962)|
| 1:06:11| And let's say he runs for commission and he wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| Let's say he runs and loses either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| And he goes to file a grievance because of his role as a sheriff's officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| How will he perceive his jury?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Essentially the merit council is the jury for his grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| If somebody on that board has been heavily politically involved in a race for or against him and he's on the losing side of that, is he going to feel like he's going to get a fair shot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=3992)|
| 1:06:43| This is a real world example that could happen within the next six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| This is stuff that may impact his livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| Again, you can see how quickly this rule, changing this, opens up a myriad of problems that we just don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4010)|
| 1:06:58| I think changing this rule and the original reform was always under the intention of what is best for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| So if you can't answer those two questions, what's broken that needs fixing and how does it benefit our officers, you shouldn't vote for this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4025)|
| 1:07:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Thank you. Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| I think I have a parliamentary question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Essentially, if we vote yes on Commissioner Jay's motion, then we're simply voting not to send this forward to the agenda for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4043)|
| 1:07:36| Is that correct, Mr. Moyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Or is that the proper way to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| That would be correct. It would die here at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| Okay. Thank you. Just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| Thank you, Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| I see Chairman Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| Do you mind to come up for a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| You can just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4083)|
| 1:08:13| Yes, ma'am. Chris Manning, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| Perfect. So this has come to us because it came from merit that the merit members voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4095)|
| 1:08:25| I wasn't at the meeting, but I saw some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| What's the reasoning why the board feels like the change needs to be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| Several of the members of the merit council believe that they wish to participate in the political process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4117)|
| 1:08:45| They also want to serve the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| And that this rule basically disallows any type of participation in any campaign, federal or state, county or city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4128)|
| 1:09:01| And they feel that they believe the motion that was moved forward to you is just for the sheriff's race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4141)|
| 1:09:11| It was a split vote, four to three, to send it forward to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| Three of the members did not support the motion, but it is coming to you with that single restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4156)|
| 1:09:23| Okay. Perfect. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| And if I can take another moment, I saw Mr. Valiant walk in, so I'd like to ask him his opinion on the reasoning why he felt like the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4166)|
| 1:09:37| And I believe that you were for this coming to the commission, so I'd just like to hear from you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| And your name and address. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| Sorry. I ran over here. I was in a late client meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| My name is John Valiant. I live at 6705 Creekhead Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4192)|
| 1:10:01| Just take a minute. You can take a breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| I'll talk in between breaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| I've done a lot of research on this specifically, and through the research, I came to the conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4209)|
| 1:10:18| I know the law director and the law director's office disagrees, but I've come to the conclusion that this ordinance, as it was passed, was unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4218)|
| 1:10:29| And it would be unconstitutional in the state of Tennessee or it would be unconstitutional at the federal level or the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| And the problem is that speech-based restrictions, especially those that are – if they're limiting freedom of speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4236)|
| 1:10:47| they have to be narrowly tailored to meet the criteria that they're supposed to – to prevent the harm, the type of harm that they are in place to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4247)|
| 1:10:58| So specifically, the Merit Council, for example, the Merit Council is an extension of county commission whose purpose is to protect the officers from political activities of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4258)|
| 1:11:13| It's understandable to say, well, we don't want those individuals, those volunteer board members, to be engaged in the sheriff's race because it could create an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4273)|
| 1:11:24| or it could create an atmosphere of potential – really some poor optics from a situation like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4284)|
| 1:11:33| So when you're dealing with content-based restrictions like that, they have to be narrowly tailored to prevent the harm in place or to prevent the type of harm that they are attempting to get rid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4293)|
| 1:11:47| So in a situation like this, unfortunately, the legislation has been drafted in a way that's just far too broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4307)|
| 1:11:56| It prevents volunteer board members who are uncompensated on all grounds in the state of Tennessee whose prime – and additionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4316)|
| 1:12:06| whose primary function within the county is a function that is – that has to do with their private employment or whatever they do in their own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4326)|
| 1:12:19| Those individuals are being – their free speech is being restricted, and it's – unfortunately, it's just drafted in a way that's way too broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4339)|
| 1:12:29| So for example, if I wanted to be involved in – if I wanted to contribute my time to the race of a judge or if I wanted to contribute my time towards the race of a senator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4349)|
| 1:12:41| whether it be a United States senator or a state senator or even a local mayor's election, I would be unable to do that as a volunteer citizen, as a citizen sitting on a volunteer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4361)|
| 1:12:55| And unfortunately, the way that it's drafted, it's just far too broad right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| And the example that's been time and time again brought up is, well, there are examples where an officer could run for a local office and that would cause problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4381)|
| 1:13:11| It could create problems down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Well, the issue with that is, okay, it doesn't address the true issue of content-based restrictions under the First Amendment of the not only United States Constitution but the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4393)|
| 1:13:26| And it doesn't really do a great job balancing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| So similarly, the argument – the arguments continue to be made, well, how does political activity help the officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| Well, from the same standpoint, you could make the argument, well, Second Amendment freedoms don't help the officers either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| How does somebody on the Merit Council owning a firearm help the officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| You can't make an argument that it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| But it doesn't really hurt them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| So that's really been the conclusion of my research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| Okay, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| I tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| Commissioner Jay and I have a disagreement on that, and I respect his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| And my opinion is there's nobody that sits on a board in Knox County that's not politically tied to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4449)|
| 1:14:16| That's how they got here, or that's how they got on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| And I don't think besides ethics there's any other boards that you have to step down from in Knox County as a free service to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4459)|
| 1:14:30| So I'm not sure how we pick and kind of choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| I think if we're going to make it where if you want to be politically involved and you sit on any committee in Knox County, then you're not politically involved or you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4473)|
| 1:14:44| It just to me doesn't feel right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| And to tell people that are volunteering their time for a committee that they can't be politically involved to me just doesn't seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| So I would have to disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| I believe these rules were recently changed and in place when every single one of the volunteers volunteered for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4507)|
| 1:15:16| So they already knew this was the circumstances of taking on that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| I don't see why any of them could step down at any point if they don't want to abide by those rules that we made already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| And if they want to enter into the political realm at that point, they're more than welcome to once they're off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| But it's a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| It wasn't like they're forced into doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| And when they decided to do it and put their name for it, they already knew what the rules were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| So I'm a little bit annoyed that this is coming back, not even 18 months later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| I've had private conversations with the gentleman that both spoke about this before they're even appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| And I asked them, like, is this going to affect, you know, your political relations being on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4554)|
| 1:16:02| I was told no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| But now this is back in front of us, and I think this is exactly why we put this there in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| to avoid this conversation happening over and over and over again because the whole point was to take politics out of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| because that's how the board got so messed up in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| So a little bit disappointed, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4579)|
| 1:16:26| I'd like to make a comment, Commissioner Jay, that perhaps you could also address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4586)|
| 1:16:36| I'm a little bit confused about what political activity might actually mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4596)|
| 1:16:47| I mean, there are some things that are very obvious, like, you know, contributing to a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4607)|
| 1:17:00| or maybe even putting your sign in your yard that speaks volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| What about activities like attending a county Republican Party event or a county Democratic Party event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4627)|
| 1:17:18| It still is considered political activity, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| and still kind of letting others know where your leanings might lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4642)|
| 1:17:29| Do you have any comments about what that political activity definition would look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| Yes, Madam Chair, and I'm fairly certain that Mr. Moyers is looking up the exact language as I reply to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| The ordinance that we originally wrote actually outlines very specifically things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| types like wearing of, you know, garb and political donations and signage and rallies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| and it actually specifically outlines that it does not restrict from being involved with political clubs and other activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4673)|
| 1:18:02| You know, it's essentially campaigning for one particular person and being involved in that particular race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| but we wrote that out very specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| I can tell you that the part about political clubs says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4692)|
| 1:18:21| however, nothing in this part shall be construed to prohibit or prevent any such board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| from becoming or continuing to be a member of a political club or organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| and enjoying all the rights and privileges of such membership of or from attending any political meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| Such board members shall not be denied freedom in the casting of a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| So that was very written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| Some of the language, and Mr. Moyers, I'm going to I'm using the red line that's on our on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| A member of the merit board shall not use such position to reflect the member's personal political feelings as those of the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4732)|
| 1:19:02| or to exert any pressure or anyone influence that person's political views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| No member of the board merit system board shall display any political advertising or paraphernalia on such a person's body or automobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4746)|
| 1:19:15| while conducting business on behalf of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| It goes into no member of the merit system ballot short solicit money for political campaigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| make any public endorsement of any candidate in any campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| So, you know, active active campaigning for one particular element, but it would not restrict going to clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| Did I say that accurately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| You did. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| And I do appreciate that, except for the situation, which happens many times in our own county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| where there may just be a Republican and a Democrat running for an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4784)|
| 1:19:51| And clearly, if that board member is active in the Democratic political party, then it's pretty evident where their leanings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4791)|
| 1:20:02| So I just I'm not I'm not really arguing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| I'm just stating that it makes it very difficult to make that as pure as it might appear to be when you line out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4806)|
| 1:20:14| You can't do ABC or D, but you can do F, which is identifying with a political entity on on a broader level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4814)|
| 1:20:28| Commissioner Durant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| I'd like to make a substitute motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| All right. We have a substitute motion on the floor to move forward without any recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| Do we have any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| Commissioner Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| With your permission, could I ask a question of Mr. Valiant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| Are you in favor of this ordinance change as presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| You have stated publicly here and in the merit system that you don't believe that the restriction of being involved with political activity is constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4867)|
| 1:21:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| I believe that the way that this ordinance is drafted is unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| I believe it opens the county up to the opportunity for litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| And I believe that county commission did not have the power to write that ordinance as it was drafted in the first place or pass that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4889)|
| 1:21:42| I don't believe county commission had the power to do that in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Does county commission have the authority to pass the ordinance as presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| So if you're for the amendment as presented and you believe that we have the authority to do so, it is written to say that it is restricting a board member from being involved with a sheriff's race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4911)|
| 1:22:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| So if we have the authority to restrict one race, why wouldn't we have the same authority to restrict all political races?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4927)|
| 1:22:18| You can't have your cake and eat it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| You either got to be for our authority or not against our authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| It's actually – so under the Constitution, so like I said, there is a constitutional analysis that you have to go through when addressing speech and specific content-based restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4946)|
| 1:22:39| So the analysis is you have to start – you have to look at the activity, and on its face, you have to make a determination as to whether or not it is speech neutral or whether or not it's constitutionally suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4959)|
| 1:22:53| So the fact that this is restricting free speech makes it a constitutionally subject rule in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4973)|
| 1:23:02| So then when you determine that it is, in fact, restricting free speech, you have to narrow your focus and make the determination as to whether or not that content-based restriction is narrowly tailored to achieve the purpose that it set out to – that it's narrowly tailored to effectively address the problems and the mission of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=4982)|
| 1:23:25| So the mission of the Merit Council is to protect the officers from political activity of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| Now, we've gone as far as saying that the political activities of the administration we want to prevent – we've said with this ordinance that political activities of the administration are bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5011)|
| 1:23:45| And we've said that we want to keep the board from engaging in political activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| But in doing that, there has to be an essential nexus in between the ordinance and the way it's drafted and the harm that it's set out to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5031)|
| 1:23:59| So the merit board, if we're here to prevent political activities and protect the officers from political activities of the administration, it absolutely makes sense that you would not want the board members to be involved in the sheriff's race because there's a direct conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5039)|
| 1:24:17| So it's okay just to restrict the sheriff's race but not all the other ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| Okay, so we are the governing body that has authority to change rules of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5062)|
| 1:24:30| We are the governing body for the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| Would it then be okay if that was expanded to, say, the sheriff's race and the county commission since there would be a direct line of authority between the county commission, the merit system, and the officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5073)|
| 1:24:43| Would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| So the problem with the way that it's drafted, the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| So the problem is with the way that it's drafted…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| No, no, if it was amended to, say, the sheriff or commission races, would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| So as I was saying, it has to be narrowly tailored to address the harm that you're trying to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| So the harm that we're trying to prevent with the merit council is protecting the officers from political activities of the administration, the sheriff's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5101)|
| 1:25:11| The political activities of county commission don't have anything to do with the political activities of the sheriff and the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5111)|
| 1:25:18| So in addition to that, there's an abundance of case law that supports how if you have each of these individuals, each of these volunteer board members, and I called other merit systems within the state of Tennessee to ask them how they were doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5118)|
| 1:25:34| And when asking them how their merit systems were and how they handled political activities, they said, well, we don't handle political activities because these are volunteer board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5134)|
| 1:25:44| If they were employees, which the law director's office has in several opinions said that this is akin to the Little Hatch Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5144)|
| 1:25:52| If they were employees, it would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| Then county commission would have the authority to say, yes, you can participate or cannot participate in any series of elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| But when you are governing the content of individual citizens, you have to narrowly tailor that content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5161)|
| 1:26:09| And so it affects the harm or so it addresses the harm that you're trying to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| So the problem is, yes, if we were employees of county commission, if we were employees of Knox County, then county commission would have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5174)|
| 1:26:21| The county commission does not have that authority because each of us is employed in our own individual capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| So, for example, I'm employed full time as an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| OK, and on the side, you know, I volunteer my time to be a part of the merit council so I can give my time and resources to protect the men and women of the of the Knox County Sheriff's Office as much as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5190)|
| 1:26:44| However, the speech based restriction, as it's written now in today's merit rules and policies and procedures, it is unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5204)|
| 1:26:55| However, the way that is drafted there is not unconstitutional because it is narrowed to address the harm that we're trying to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5215)|
| 1:27:04| Do you do you usually participate in unconstitutional actions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| Now, you volunteer to be part of this board, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| Yes. You agreed in front of this commission to serve on this board under its rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5234)|
| 1:27:22| Yes. You're now telling us that those rules and regulations are unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| So why did you sign up for a board that you felt was unconstitutional and agree to serve under its rules that you feel like are unconstitutional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5247)|
| 1:27:35| At the time I signed up for the board, I hadn't had the chance to fully do a deep dive of every single rule and regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| No, no. You stood before this body. Yes. And you said we asked you very specifically, do you understand this? And you said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5260)|
| 1:27:48| OK. And so in the time that you've been a part of county commission, have you changed any rules or regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| Similarly, the answer is yes. Similarly, I became a part of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| And in addressing the several things that have happened and looking and doing research and doing my homework on the things that have happened, I realized, oh, this is unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5279)|
| 1:28:09| Now, at the time that I volunteered, I did review the board. I did review the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| And I came before county commission and I said, I have reviewed these rules and I am willing to abide by these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| However, if county commission has done something that's unconstitutional, there's nothing in there that says I'm not allowed to come before county commission and check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5298)|
| 1:28:26| No, I just wanted to I just wanted to make sure I understood it. And my last council has done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| I understand. Mr. Moyer, my last question, Mr. Moyers, could you please provide this commission with a quick summary of your opinion on if our rules as currently written are constitutional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5312)|
| 1:28:47| Well, I'd start by saying that neither I nor Mr. Valiant can judge whether they're constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| That would require a court. But in my opinion, yes, we the commission has the authority to amend its rules the way it did to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5334)|
| 1:29:04| And the Merit System Council that we operate under was a private act that applied to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| When Knox County adopted the charter, that private act was carried forward as an ordinance because it is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| Now, this county commission has the authority to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| There is a long history of time, place, manner restrictions on speech that governments can impose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5359)|
| 1:29:30| Mr. Valiant knows my feelings about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| I actually think that the fact that we're talking about an uncompensated volunteer board makes increases the authority of the commission to to write a rule such as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5372)|
| 1:29:46| because we are not relating an employee's compensation to their willingness to give up certain of their speech rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5386)|
| 1:29:59| So, for example, under the rules that existed under the merit system for decades, going back to the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5399)|
| 1:30:07| sheriff's deputies were not allowed to participate in the political process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| That has never been found to be unconstitutional and happens probably all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| But when we do that, we're saying to a sheriff's deputy, if you want a paycheck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| you must agree to give up this First Amendment or to accept some limitations on your First Amendment right to freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5423)|
| 1:30:31| That is not the case with the members of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| The members of this board volunteered to be on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| They are uncompensated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| They can resign from the board tomorrow with no consequence, financial or otherwise, to themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| To my mind, that means that these rules are more constitutional, more easily justified before a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5445)|
| 1:30:56| than they would be if we were talking about compensated employees in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| because these folks are free to serve on the board or not serve on the board as they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| And if they choose not to, they don't lose a dime from their compensation, one hopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| So, simply put, I believe that this is a constitutional time, place, manner restriction on content of speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5469)|
| 1:31:21| that applies to members of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| And the justification being that you wish the members of this board not to be involved in the political process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5484)|
| 1:31:31| because this is a board that is designed to put a wall between sheriff's deputies and the political process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| I think is a justifiable rationale for the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5498)|
| 1:31:45| So, in our opinion, this rule was constitutional when it was imposed and it's constitutional now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| Would it be constitutional, in your opinion, if it was amended to say the sheriff and county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| or the sheriff, county commission, county clerk or any other Knox County offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| I will say that, as a general proposition, what Mr. Valiant has said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| The broader the rule, the greater the restriction on speech, the harder it is to justify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5529)|
| 1:32:18| I think limiting this body to elections, I think, would be upheld if it were challenged in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5538)|
| 1:32:32| That's as much as I can really say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| To the extent that you take it from being all elections and make it narrower, I think it becomes stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| But do I think it's unconstitutional where it is right now? I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| I think you just answered my question, Law Director Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| So, you're saying the way it currently reads is constitutional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| In my opinion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| If I thought otherwise, I would have brought that up a year and a half ago when we were passing these regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5598)|
| 1:33:29| How many members of the Merit Council want to participate in political campaigns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| Four voted in favor of the change in the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| So, four have identified that they want to participate in campaigns in 2024?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| Well, specifically to your question, two did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| But the two others that did not actually offer comments during the discussion voted in favor, so I can infer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5628)|
| 1:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| And it's all public record, correct, your meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| Were you in favor of changing the rules for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| That's all I had to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| Just some questions and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| My questions and comments aren't about anything being constitutional or unconstitutional, but really more general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5661)|
| 1:34:28| And my first question is, why do we even address political activity on this specific board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5668)|
| 1:34:35| We have boards and committees that are also county-affiliated that do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| I also wonder, why are we looking at this so closely within the law enforcement profession?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5681)|
| 1:34:49| That concerns me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| I've also loosely researched other merit boards across the state, and again, they do not address political activity in their rules either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5693)|
| 1:35:07| I think I said, I don't know that we have any other boards or committees that have these types of restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| And then my final comment is that I've heard more from officers on this than I have on merit board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5714)|
| 1:35:25| And I know that that's the intention and the mission and the role of the merit board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| but they feel like anyone who serves in any capacity should be able to exercise their right to participate in a political campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5732)|
| 1:35:43| I mean, if we did that, I think everyone would have to recuse themselves from zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5743)|
| 1:35:57| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| All right. Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| We currently have a substitute motion on the board to move forward without recommendation made by Commissioner Durrett, seconded by Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5764)|
| 1:36:15| Seeing no other lights, let's take a roll call on this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5775)|
| 1:36:23| Commissioner Lundy? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| Commissioner Durrett? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5785)|

| 1:36:43| Commissioner Jay? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Commissioner Frazier? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5805)|
| 1:37:00| All right. This motion failed, the count of five supporting it, six against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5820)|
| 1:37:07| So we go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| It was made by Commissioner Jay, seconded by Commissioner Ward, that we deny the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5830)|
| 1:37:21| approving the amendment of Knox County Sheriff's Office Employees Merit System Rules and Regulations 3.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5841)|
| 1:37:28| to narrow restrictions on the board members' political activities to apply exclusively to the elections for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5848)|
| 1:37:38| All right. Could we have roll call again, please? This is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| Commissioner Durrett? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5863)|

| 1:38:13| This motion to deny passes on a 6-5 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5893)|
| 1:38:24| Next agenda item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| Item number 51, resolution 910, supporting legislation regarding the practices of rating agencies operating in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5908)|
| 1:38:42| Do I have a motion? Motion to stand for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| Second. Motion by Daly, second by Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| Commissioner Daly, did you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| I would. I'm no expert in this, but I know that our Fire and Rescue Committee has been discussing this for probably the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5933)|
| 1:39:02| and I got Chief Harnish, if he would come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| It has to do with the ratings of the fire departments and dealing with the insurance, correct, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5946)|
| 1:39:17| Yes, sir, that is correct. I'm Jerry Harnish. I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| So my agency and the Karnes Fire Department, as I think all of you know, are dependent on contracts with property owners for financial support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5963)|
| 1:39:33| Those contracts are referred to as subscriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| There is one rating agency that is approved by the Department of Commerce and Insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| In its rules, it says that for subscription fire departments, a subscription must be present in order to qualify for a discount from the insurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5980)|
| 1:39:50| Otherwise, the premium that applies should be the premium as if the property were unprotected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| Now, that's a significant difference, two and a half or three times more if the premium has to be calculated as unprotected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=5995)|
| 1:40:04| The manager for the Insurance Services Office in Tennessee has decided that the definition of a subscription fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6004)|
| 1:40:11| is not a fire department that is dependent on subscription for revenue, but a fire department that refuses emergency service to non-subscribers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6011)|
| 1:40:19| That interpretation is not used by ISO in other states. It is used here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| And the Department of Commerce and Insurance says that they don't feel like they have any statutory authority to regulate the rating agency in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6025)|
| 1:40:33| So what the resolution asks is for the delegation of House and Senate members from Tennessee to persuade the state legislature to give Commerce and Insurance that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6033)|
| 1:40:47| I'll yield for other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| Thank you. Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to point out to the commissioners that during our last, I think, three, maybe four legislative priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6052)|
| 1:41:03| final agendas that we have presented to our state, this was on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6063)|
| 1:41:11| This is something I think has to be addressed on a state level, but it's been part of our legislative priorities for at least the last three years, if not four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| But I'm glad that Commissioner Daley is bringing it back up and maybe we're trying to put a little bit more emphasis on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| So there is a description in your 2024 legislative priorities under fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6084)|
| 1:41:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd like to ask the sponsor of the resolution if I could sign on to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6095)|
| 1:41:42| And have you had an opportunity to communicate this to any of our Knoxville legislative delegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6102)|
| 1:41:51| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| Hopefully all commissioners would go on this because it will look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| We're going to send it to our state delegations, the chair, vice chairs of the Commerce and Insurance committees down in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| So the answer is yes, and hopefully everybody will agree to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| I have spoken with Senator Massey and Senator Briggs, and Representative Wright, a couple of them in passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6129)|
| 1:42:19| and they know the issue and they're concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| And like anything, they'd like to have something there to say, hey, my commission in Knox County is behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6144)|
| 1:42:32| So the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| Everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| Is everyone in agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion on the floor to approve, made by Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6169)|
| 1:42:57| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| Did you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| I did, but if all commission, I would change it to approve if all commissioners agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6183)|
| 1:43:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| Thank you for that correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| We're taking a vote now for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| Item 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Item number 52 is Ordinance 101, amending the Knox County Code, Chapter 42, Article 2, Division 2, Section 42-53,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6209)|
| 1:43:41| Merit System Board of Directors to narrow restrictions on board members' political activities to apply exclusively to elections for Knox County Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6221)|

| 1:44:29| This is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| Do we have a motion on this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| With a clarification, if I could ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| Since the other thing failed, do we still vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6282)|
| 1:44:49| Yes, because what we have is a two-part process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| When we made the amendments to the Merit Council Ordinance, it wasn't just the restrictions on political activities that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6293)|
| 1:45:00| Another thing that changed was this body gave itself the authority to approve Merit Council rules, to review and approve those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6300)|
| 1:45:08| What we voted on a moment ago was an amendment to the Merit Council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| This is an amendment to the actual ordinance that we passed a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6313)|

| 1:47:28| to allow a right of grievance for suspensions of any time length that result in a loss of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6448)|

| 1:47:56| Motion by Jay, second by Beeler to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| Am I correct that the original ordinance read three days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6484)|
| 1:48:11| It did, yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| The original, all the provisions related to right of grievances had to do with three days or loss of pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6493)|
| 1:48:24| and the board opted to pick this up, debate it, and simplify it to essentially say any result in loss of pay is something that could be grievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6504)|
| 1:48:37| And I think the law department might have an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| Well, the only thing, just procedural, this will have to be voted on at commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| So even if you vote to approve, it doesn't go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| It has to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| So motion to send on, motion to approve, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6530)|

| 1:49:46| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6586)|

| 1:49:54| Second by Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| And this is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6603)|
| 1:50:12| Director, do you know about this or can you fill me in what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| Here comes Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| Yeah, that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| Yeah, Zach Webb, Knox County IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| Yeah, Director Holden and I have been briefed on this as well as Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| We're up to speed on the general layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| I can speak from the tech side, but we co-sponsored this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| For obvious reasons, the grants and the business side of this is definitely more in Director Holden's wheelhouse here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| I guess the main question is what do we consider a broadband-ready community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| So that also may be better defined by Director Holden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| It's really just a layout of that the broadband accessibility is there throughout the county, which it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6653)|
| 1:51:00| and its intent is to be able to serve and stack programs on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6660)|
| 1:51:06| I think that's, again, a better question for Director Holden as far as the purpose of the broadband-ready designation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6666)|
| 1:51:18| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| Jenny Holden, 400 West Main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| Commissioner, first I just want to say how much my department appreciates Zach's department and Jim Snowden, EPW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| They worked with us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| Being designated as a broadband-ready community provides us access to additional grant funding on the state level that we wouldn't have otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6691)|
| 1:51:39| So really all we're doing, we worked with Jim's team to see if we were changing anything in our typical process and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6699)|
| 1:51:47| We're really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| There were a couple of minor tweaks that we needed to make to an application that Jim's team did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| We're really just putting, codifying what we already have in place right now with EPW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6713)|
| 1:52:04| Is there any other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6724)|

| 1:54:15| I think the priority with this would be let's get this up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| Let's make it successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| The other is that the city on the city side, city services, picks up the DOAs currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6862)|
| 1:54:32| So, again, there would have to be some delineation between city and county in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6872)|
| 1:54:39| And it would be an additional service as far as manpower and equipment and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| But I'm certainly open to talking about it as we get this, after this transition happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| and we're able to focus on the core responsibility of what this proposal outlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6892)|
| 1:55:06| I will have some more questions next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| I just don't get permission from the person, two people that I've talked to, that would be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| So that's why I want to make the recommendation to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6914)|
| 1:55:22| But I can see that this should be part, if you're taking over any and all of the animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6922)|
| 1:55:31| I don't see why you could not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| You're going to add 17 new positions, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| The same number that currently exists between the city and county together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| And so, like I say, they haven't in the past, even when we ran county animal control in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6941)|
| 1:55:52| that was not a part of their responsibility at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| But, you know, I'm open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| And I think that's something that we would just have to think through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6958)|
| 1:56:06| But, again, it would be an additional service to what's already being outlined at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6966)|
| 1:56:12| Well, I know that right now it went away from the sheriff's office to the roads department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| And our road department needs to be doing road work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| And I will be in favor of this if we can work out some type of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6982)|
| 1:56:32| If not, I may be the only no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| But I think that it needs to be moved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| You're not only getting the dollars behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| You're also getting the positions and how many county trucks, three, four trucks, five, whatever the trucks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7002)|
| 1:56:49| So I think you could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion and a second to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| Thank you, Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| Public forum, we do have one speaker signed up, Ms. Tina Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7031)|

| 1:57:57| So I don't have a whole lot to say now except for the level of ‑‑ I don't know what word to use here without being too ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7077)|

| 1:58:32| Nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| And I just don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7117)|

| 1:58:45| And for you not to do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7125)|
| 1:58:54| Commissioner Hill said at the end of the last public forum that you had no hiring and firing power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7134)|
| 1:59:06| Well, then who does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| Have you all asked that amongst yourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| Who does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Who can make a difference here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| If you all can't, then who do you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7156)|
| 1:59:22| Who do we ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| Now, I know that there's a lot going on over in Nashville now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| There's 14 Democrats, I guess, maybe more by now, that have signed this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7170)|
| 1:59:36| And they're going to be looking all over the state of Tennessee at all the other juvenile detention centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7176)|
| 1:59:43| But right here and right now, we have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7183)|
| 1:59:48| And they are children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| They may be in there for crimes that ‑‑ or offenses that we don't normally associate with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7191)|
| 2:00:01| But they are still children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| And they deserve to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| They deserve to be able to have their dignity, no matter what they are charged with or not charged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7206)|
| 2:00:15| Some of them I don't think ‑‑ I think some of them are just awaiting trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| And to have someone say ‑‑ to have someone say, someone who's supposed to be in charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7219)|
| 2:00:27| to have someone say, lock them up, lock them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| And if you can't deal with it, well, then send them to another facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| Where are these children going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| What other facility are these children going to go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| You all have got to ask these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| You have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7245)|

| 2:00:58| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7258)|
| 2:01:05| Commissioner Jay, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| I would like to respond, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| First, I want to thank you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| You've come to the meetings, and I enjoy that you participate and you engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7273)|
| 2:01:20| So, first of all, I want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| The next part is, it's hard to hear someone say that I'm not doing my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7284)|
| 2:01:35| Because, sadly, the public doesn't see 98% of the job that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7295)|
| 2:01:43| It is making those phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| It is reaching out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| It is trying to connect and ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| And believe me, I ask a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7312)|
| 2:01:59| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| We have a lot of issues and a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| And I think we're all, I can't speak for my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| but I would like to think we're all doing our very best to address what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7329)|
| 2:02:16| Because I know that I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| And so I appreciate you very much calling us out and keeping us accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| But I just wanted to respond on behalf of myself that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7345)|
| 2:02:32| We are working very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| And you all don't get to see much or most of the work that we are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7354)|
| 2:02:40| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| I hope that you continue to come and you continue to bring things to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7366)|

| 2:02:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| No, sir, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| I had signed up for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| I don't know why she did not get my name down this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7376)|
| 2:03:07| Commissioner Schoonmaker, did you have something you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7387)|
| 2:03:15| I will give you the courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| I do not have you signed up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| But if you could be very brief, please, maybe just a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| How about three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Let's compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| Your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| Elwood Roach, Rick Roach, and that's Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7410)|
| 2:03:35| To piggyback on what Commissioner Frazier was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| and I've heard this from elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| especially here in Knoxville and Knox County, we're doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7424)|
| 2:03:50| We're working hard and we're doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| I don't doubt that that's, from your end, what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7432)|
| 2:04:00| The question is how it appears to the people, to the constituents that you say you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7440)|
| 2:04:08| That's the main point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| It's not about your feelings about you doing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| It is about how the people who elect you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| as minimal participation as Knoxville and Knox County has in the election process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7459)|
| 2:04:26| and that input, that's what really counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| That's what really counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| Not your feelings about how you think you're doing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7473)|
| 2:04:39| And that's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| So, you know, we've gone through a lot of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7482)|
| 2:04:48| because we had an elected official who could not bring his employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| as some of us well know, to be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7494)|
| 2:05:01| And there was silence from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| That's not doing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| That's not doing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| That's not doing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| And when it gets down to it, and when we're doing harm to those who have the least ability to stand up for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7516)|
| 2:05:25| and you all don't say anything or do anything or try to say, yeah, I've made these phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| and tell us about the phone calls that you've made and who you've talked to and who you've tried to hold responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7531)|
| 2:05:38| So we don't have to sit up here and talk out the back of our you-know-whats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7538)|
| 2:05:46| and wonder what's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7546)|
| 2:05:52| It's not a game of, well, you go on a little treasure hunt and try to find out this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| No, you all inform us of what you are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| That's your responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| It's not a big secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| And you all need to quit acting like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| I do appreciate you, Commissioner Jay, for the lesson that you gave to the county today on that whole issue about the merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7572)|
| 2:06:21| That's good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| But I only got a few seconds, so do your jobs, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| Quit trying to define your jobs after you get in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7589)|
| 2:06:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| And I would like to encourage anyone out there that's listening, if you have specific questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| please start out with calling your county commissioner or e-mail your county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7602)|
| 2:06:49| I think I speak for most of us here when I tell you we do return our phone calls, we do answer our e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7609)|
| 2:06:57| and we do try very hard to be responsive to anyone that contacts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| So that would be my initial recommendation to the gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| And anyone else that has specific questions, please start out by contacting your county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| Item number 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7636)|

| 2:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| I had asked that this be put on with a proposal made for one change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7649)|
| 2:07:38| Everyone has received a copy of the proposed meetings for 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7658)|
| 2:07:50| The way it stands right now in the month of May, if you all would please consider this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7670)|
| 2:07:57| the schedule reads that we will have workshop on Monday, May 20th, and the regular commission meeting on the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7677)|
| 2:08:10| I am proposing that that be pushed back a week so that our workshop is on Monday, the 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7690)|
| 2:08:20| and that our regular commission meeting is on Monday, the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| Doing this allows us to free up the Memorial Day holiday and not have to have a meeting in that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7705)|
| 2:08:37| I have already checked, and Drew has confirmed that this assembly room is available for both of those substitute dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7717)|

| 2:09:58| Item 59 is mine, and I would like to discuss it next week during our zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7798)|
| 2:10:04| Item 60, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7804)|

| 2:10:17| It's been asked to be two different times to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| Both times it was pulled before it got to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| And you might want a picture's worth a thousand words on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7824)|
| 2:10:32| If you're out my way, drive by there, and you'll look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7832)|

| 2:10:38| So a picture's worth a thousand words, or you can take my word for it, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7838)|

| 2:11:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7893)|

| 2:11:41| I did not ask our at-large as either one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| I just wanted to bring to commission's attention that we have started to see some of the justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7904)|
| 2:11:51| in the staff reports that it's because of decisions that have been made in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7911)|
| 2:11:57| that they are using to justify future approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| And you should really, really take some time and look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| because that may be before your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| It could have been during your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| But sometimes those decisions weren't always the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| And then also, just to remind everyone, this Saturday is a pretty busy Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-l-1462-231211?start=7933)|
