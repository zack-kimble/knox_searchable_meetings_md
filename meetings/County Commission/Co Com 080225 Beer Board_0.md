| 0:01:09| Do I hear a motion for approval of the January's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| First and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| Commissioner, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Now we have the swearing in for those that are going to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| And they'll be taking oath from the law director will give us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| So, law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Everyone who is going to testify today, please stand and be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=95)|
| 0:01:41| Anyone who is here to speak on a matter, please stand and be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=101)|
| 0:01:48| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| You ready, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Raise your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| Each of you swear or affirm that through your testimony here today you will tell the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| and nothing but the truth so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Our first application clerk, if you'll read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Thomas Joseph Pitner, MTMs, 7712 Clinton Highway for own premises, formerly Raymond's Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=130)|
| 0:02:20| If you'll come forward and the law director will ask you a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| Are you Mr. Pitner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| My first question to you, Mr. Pitner, is have you complied with Knox County's new adult business ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=151)|
| 0:02:44| Sir, I really have had a copy of that law, and as far as complying with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=164)|
| 0:02:52| I don't know what would apply to me because I was assuming that we are a lot more different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| than the adult bookstore end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| So if you could, you know, get with me sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| I had called before when I got my business license and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| and wanted to try to meet with the law director on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| and I never did get any contact back, but I did contact Jimmy Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| and that's how they sent the stuff out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| Yeah, he got it through me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| If you fall in under the adult business act, then you would not be entitled to have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=209)|
| 0:03:41| You understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| Basically, what you need to do is to make sure that you're not covered by the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| And the information that I have is that you probably are subject to the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=230)|
| 0:03:57| If you're subject to the new adult business ordinance, then you're not allowed to sell beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=237)|
| 0:04:09| or even have beer on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| And so today would kind of be a nullity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| Under the act, if you're an adult cabaret, which means a nightclub, a bar, other establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=256)|
| 0:04:26| which regularly features persons who appear semi-nude, and the information that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| and you can tell me if it's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| is that you certainly have persons who appear semi-nude in your establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| They would be topless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| Well, then you're not entitled to a beer permit, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| and you need to post haste comply with our new sexually oriented adult business ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=289)|
| 0:05:00| Get your application filed, and you need to do so pretty soon because we're going to be knocking on your door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Can I make an appointment with you through your office to go over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| make sure I come in compliance with everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Sir, I don't have anything to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| You've gotten the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| We made sure that the clerk's office had the applications available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| They're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| They're on file with the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| I haven't received an application, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Then you need to go and ask for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| I won't sit here and argue with you, but the applications are available through the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| The Knox County clerk is the one who is instrumental through our ordinance in evaluating whether you complete your form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=338)|
| 0:05:47| whether you comply with the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| So you need to go to the Knox County clerk and pick up an application, get it filled out, and get it filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| Mr. Pritner, we may have a few more questions, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| You know who the clerk is next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Right here next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Just by means of clarification, you're wanting to change from Raymond's Place to MTM's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| That would be the new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| But you would still have Topless Dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Mr. Law Director, under our new law, would his establishment be able to sell beer at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| So there would be no beer sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| No beer sales, no beer on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| And also with regards to the amount of distance that patrons would need to stay from the dancers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| there's also a regulation on that, as I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| And all of that's within our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| Our ordinance, we've just gone through a court process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| It is up at the Court of Appeals now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| A notice of appeal has been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| But the district court found in Knox County's favor about two months ago found that our ordinance was constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| And we're up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| And so that's what I say to you is that you need to get your application filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| We're up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| We'll comply to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| Do I hear a motion for withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| I'll make a motion we withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| Second by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Larry Bart Minot, Chatterbox 8227, Chapman Highway for Home Premises, formerly Swedes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=455)|
| 0:07:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Are you Mr. Minot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Mr. Minot, I need to go through a series of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| It's pretty routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| And then some of the members of the board may have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| First of all, have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Has beer ever been sold here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| And is there an outstanding license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| This is for an on-premise consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| On-premise only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Look at your application here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Do you own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| No, I don't own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Who owns the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Ralph Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| And so you lease it from Ralph Schultz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Does anyone else have an interest in your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| You're going to be the person operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Since you're going to be the one operating the business, are you, sir, familiar with the beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with those regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Do you have one scheduled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| When I get back off vacation, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| We need some reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| What's pending about the health department report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| The health inspector could not get in touch with the owner of the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=565)|
| 0:09:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Therefore, an inspection is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Well, right here is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Maybe you all could coordinate your calendars today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| Sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| Beer board inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Mr. Law director, that place of business does not meet the 500-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=587)|
| 0:09:56| It's a they hadn't been beer sold up ever since January of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=596)|
| 0:10:05| Nobody's even been in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| We've issued two or three business tax, but nobody ever opened it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=608)|
| 0:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| You know, what we have, Mr. Inspector, is a letter from Kim Ayler with Knox County Codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| and she states that there are no zoning conflicts with either of these applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| Well, Mr. Law director, I believe the court ruled that our laws ordinance was set fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=631)|
| 0:10:44| Do you have something that shows that they're within, what, 500 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| They're 135 feet, Mr. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Do you have a map that shows that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| I did just there ago, but I don't know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| In fact, I've got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| I don't believe I'm looking at one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| While we're looking at this, fire marshal, have you done a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Ours is pending for the same reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| We repeatedly tried to contact him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| We left a written notice on the front door, and he's never contacted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| He will require a permit from Knox County Code Administration for occupying this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=689)|
| 0:11:42| Now, when you say he'll require a permit, why do you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Our policy has always been if they are, if the building has been vacated for more than six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| at that point they are required to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| So how long has this building been vacated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Well, I've got two previous permit applications in the file where they applied for permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| and never obtained a certificate of occupancy or occupied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| It's been well over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Sir, it looks like the map does show that you are within 100 feet of an ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=737)|
| 0:12:30| You see within 130 feet of a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Is that what you're saying, Mr. Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| When I checked it, I asked them to look for residential or agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| That's what they gave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Hold on just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| Can you put this together for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=774)|
| 0:13:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| But he gets the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| But who would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=791)|
| 0:13:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| U.K., while he's looking for that, would it be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| I'm just a map person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| It helps me so much when I can look and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| In the future, U.K., can we get some maps with the applicants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| I mean, get the MPC maps for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| That way, if something like this comes up, we've got it right here beside us that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| We can look at zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| I'd be glad to, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| There's only four, about four places of business left in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| Just hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| Go ahead, U.K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| You were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| I think Chip wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Mr. Law Director, Kim Ayler is on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| She says that was granted a variance last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| It was what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| It was granted a variance last year and that it was on her letter that she sent up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| Well, it doesn't refer to a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| Well, yeah, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Yeah, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=875)|
| 0:14:45| Who's previously applied for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Did you previously apply for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| I'm trying to think of when this matter has come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| It's been before us three times, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| One lady, Christy Allen, that was out for drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| The other fellow passed away before he got moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| And I'm getting old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| I can't remember all these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Sir, what's your relationship with the previous applicants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| I have none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| You don't have any business relationship with Christy Allen or was that the daughter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| Is this the one where the mom and the daughter were applying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| No, it was two women that was applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| One worked in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| The other one lives right next door to the place of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| Sir, do you have any other establishments that sell beer on premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| Have you established a corporation for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Are you going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Just a sole proprietorship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| You are definitely within the requirement in our zoning ordinance, which for those of you who aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=975)|
| 0:16:26| familiar with our zoning code, we have some new commissioners who are on board today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| If you're in a general business zone, in a CA, you cannot sell beer for consumption on the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=992)|
| 0:16:42| if you're within 500 feet of a residential or an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| And that's by virtue of our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| What they have to do in that case, if they fall within that definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| they have to come to the Board of Zoning Appeals and get a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| And it appears that Ms. Aylor has checked on that, and this location received a variance on April 25, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1023)|
| 0:17:15| of this 500-foot setback to 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| And so you certainly fall now within our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| We can make variations for certain operations for certain persons who have convinced the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1046)|
| 0:17:37| that they should have an exception, that an exception should be made, and apparently one has been made for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1057)|
| 0:17:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| So we have pending inspections from the health department and from the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1069)|
| 0:17:58| And server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| And then you're going to schedule and complete server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Does anyone else on the board have any questions for this gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| I actually have a question for Victoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| This is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| Are you familiar with this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| I mean, have you driven by it or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| I always like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| I know in my district we had one that was close to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| But the issue with it was is that the little place had been a beer joint since the 40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| And the place was really not fit to be anything but a beer joint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| And so had we not granted the permit, we would have essentially rendered that piece of property worthless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| And so that's always a question I like to see on a situation like this where, you know, there's a variance involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| Is this a location that if we don't grant a permit, are we going to rob value from a taxpayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| Could I ask Larry, Larry, could you explain to me where this is located on Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| It's near Henry's Chapel Road, Chapman Highway, going towards Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| It would be on the right about an eighth of a mile near Betty's Forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| Is it in the same little strip mall as Betty's Forest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| No, it's right past it going towards Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| It's at the corner of Circle Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Do you know where Circle Road is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| It's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| In fact, I've got a picture of it if you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| UK, this has been brought before us, and this is the third time at this location, I believe, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| I guess I'm interested, Mr. Minard, in your, you said you have no relationship with the other two applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| We have turned it down both times because of issues with the people wanting to operate the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| So could you tell me a little bit about your relationship with the owner, Mr. Schultz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| and how you decided to get involved with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| I've known Ralph Schultz since I was a little kid, and he ran the establishment for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| And when he retired, he rented it to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| And after that gentleman passed away, it's been empty since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| And I've known Ralph for years, and he approached me and asked me if I was interested in opening it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| And I told him that I would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| How long has it been closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| Probably for well over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Yes, well over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| And the commissioners that are going through there, they're going to widen that highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| They're going to put an armed rail right in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| I don't know whether Ralph told you that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| When are they supposed to widen the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| I'd say just pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| They've got to do something to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| There's too much traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| But, I mean, are there plans on the drawing board for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Are they spot right away and that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Or is it set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| I'm almost sure, Commissioner, that the state owns probably up to the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1276)|
| 0:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Sir, are you involved in any litigation related to this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Are you aware of any litigation related to the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| I just had a question with regard to the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| U.K. had mentioned it before, and I've driven up and down Chapman Highway, and there is a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| How do people enter and leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| What is the egress to your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| And because you don't really want people drinking entering on to Chapman Highway, is there a safe route for them to enter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| Yeah, there's a side road that you can enter on, and there's parking in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| And there's access from the back parking to the side door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| We need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Let me say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| It's not a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| U.K., you're pressing on your button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| I can't operate that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| I say there's no turn lane at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| If you want to stay there, you've got to go straight across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| It's a hazard for public safety and welfare of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Did I hear a motion for approval or disapproval pending the outstanding information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1363)|
| 0:22:54| I'll make a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Pending the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| And the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1379)|

| 0:23:01| Server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Second by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1391)|
| 0:23:20| Good luck to you, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| I have a question with regards to the Flying J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| We approved giving them the beer permit pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| They're down on Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| I've gotten some phone calls from people saying they haven't been able to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| Could anybody update me on what's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| I believe it was August that we approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| They we did a fire inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| It was pending during your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| And they've never called back for a re-inspection on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| So they would need to call you to have you come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| And it's clear on our report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| We explain to them and indicate on the report it's their obligation to call us once they've corrected the violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| And they haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| I'll make sure that they know that they're to give you a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Is there anything else coming before the beer board this afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| We passed ordinance in 96, probably, where you had to be certified to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1462)|
| 0:24:33| New employees had to be certified within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| When they went through the class, they had a, it was good for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| We forgot to put the three years in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| We need that done right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| We need to come up with a new ordinance that reads it expires in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1489)|
| 0:24:57| Why don't the two of us get together on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| And we can bring it to commission for a change if we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| And, Mr. Law Director, can we combine this with where we're already trying to get on the same page as far as beer laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1505)|
| 0:25:13| as the town of Farragut and the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Could we just bundle that with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Well, for the ladies and gentlemen who just joined us this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| we are going through a process right now where we're trying to bring our ordinance into sync with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1524)|
| 0:25:34| as well as the city of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| So the hours of operation, I mean, you name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| We want them all to be as closely related as we can, if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| And it will help as far as enforcement goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| You can step over the city of Knoxville line into Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| and you've got all kinds of different hours of operation and it kind of hurts our folks who try to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| So we are working with these other two entities to try to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| Hopefully, we can have that done within your tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| Your tenure and mine, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Anything else come before the beer board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| I hear a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Seconded by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| All in favor say let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225beerboard?start=1588)|
