| 0:11:00| I'm here on behalf of Candoro Properties, Inc., and their application for rezoning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=660)|
| 0:11:08| the property located at 4430 Candora Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| It's our position that this property should be rezoned to IH heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| This property got downzoned through recode, and prior to recode, it was I-4, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=680)|
| 0:11:29| the equivalent of the heavy industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| As noted in the packet, staffs recommended denying our rezoning request, and its basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| and crux was that IH isn't consistent with the surrounding development and that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| area has been transitioning to light industrial since the late 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| In coming up with their opinion or recommendation of denial, staff relied on there being only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| three building permits issued within a quarter mile since 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Our position in response to this is that these properties have been consistently owned, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| the most part, by the same owner since the early 90s for 30-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| The uses on those properties, the industrial uses have taken place during that time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| the majority of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Therefore, there would not be an issue or a need to have a new building permit issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| So in reliance on that, or that would be a flawed argument of reliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| In fact, they're directly to, and I think I stated my directions wrong in my appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| but directly to the east of this parcel in question, there are several parcels that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| zoned IH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| In fact, it's approximately 15 acres in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| Then to the west, adjacent to this property on the west side of Kandora Avenue, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| approximately 25 acres that are zoned IH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| If you look on the map, there's a long stretch there of IH property, except we are right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| in the center, and we were rezoned to IMU during recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| Also noted in the staff report, it's telling that the one-year plan and the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=793)|
| 0:13:23| are both designated as heavy industrial for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| That is maintained the same that is on all the properties around here that are IH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| Our IMU property still has a one-year plan and a sector plan of heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=813)|
| 0:13:41| In regards to the recode, my client contends that he never received notice of the downzoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| during recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Now, I know everybody's heard this complaint over and over, but I've submitted in my packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| evidence that my client obtained following the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| He was instructed to go to the clerk's office or the planning staff's office to confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| that the letter had been sent, and I've submitted that with my packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| If you look at that, you'll notice that it was addressed to an address that does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=848)|
| 0:14:16| exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| It's a north shore drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| It was addressed to N Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| It's a quick search, and that road does not exist in the city of Knoxville nor Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| In my packet, I've cited Tennessee statute and certain legal precedent that provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| that clear and sufficient notice must be provided to a property owner whose zoning may be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| by rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Like I said, these legal citations are in my letter to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| I think the evidence is clear that notice was not given to my client, and therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=889)|
| 0:14:57| he had no way to object or know to object that his property was being downzoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| Now, I know it was in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| Recode went on for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| There were community meetings, but I submit that unless you're on counsel, unless you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| serve in a role like I do, or you're a developer, the majority of people didn't understand Recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| or know what Recode really was or why it was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| All they know is that I've owned my property for X number of years, and this doesn't affect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| I don't even need to look into this, and that was the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| My client's owned this property for over 30 plus years, in fact, owns 60 acres of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| within this immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| He's invested heavily in this area, and at the end of the day, we have proposed a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=939)|
| 0:15:49| which is usually hard to do on these, and that compromise is that we—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| Mr. Forster, will—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Okay, you finished your sentence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Is that we go to a split zoning of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| The Candor buildings where people are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Okay, that's your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| I'm sure if counsel has more questions, they can pose them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| Next person signed up to speak on this is Dax Witherspoon, in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| Mr. Witherspoon, if you could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| Hi, I'm Dax Witherspoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| I live at 1000 Gray Eagle, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| Like Forster said, or Taylor said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| the only reason I found out that we got rezoned is we were renting some of the property to Rogers Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1003)|
| 0:16:52| so they could store some of their aggregate that is coming off the 640 project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| And, you know, I was in good faith with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| I rented the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| We signed an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| They went for permits, and they were denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And we were like, how is that so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| And come to find out that we were rezoned without us knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| We went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| We've looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| I've tried to research it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| And, you know, everywhere I go, people say, we have no idea how it got rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| And, you know, truthfully, in my opinion, how can one partial or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1048)|
| 0:17:36| one piece of land get rezoned when everything around it is heavy industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| So I'm just, you know, really dumbfounded of how to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| and I'd love to find the answers of who started and why this one parcel got rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1068)|
| 0:17:57| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| And one person has signed up to speak in opposition to this, Eric Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| Mr. Johnson, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| My name is Eric Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| I live at 438 Mayfield Avenue in the Vestal Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| I serve as president of the Vestal Community Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| The Vestal Community Organization agrees with the Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| and the staff recommendation denying this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| We maintain that the rezoning request to heavy industrial is not consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| with the surrounding residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| We are a residential community now with an identity connected with the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| and character of Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| The Candoro Marble Building and surroundings help define Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| We wish to see this area protected and preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| The Vestal Community used to be an industrial area with people living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| and working in the same community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Now Vestal is much more residential with people driving, taking the CAT bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| and even riding bicycles longer distances to get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| In addition, there are more outdoor activities available to enjoy in Vestal now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1165)|
| 0:19:35| The Vestal Community Organization has taken on projects to help us maintain our identity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| while transitioning to our more residential, less industrial nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| We have created opportunities for families to enjoy the outdoor areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| We extended the Murray Vestal Greenway from a greenway that went nowhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| to connect to West Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| The city helped us extend the trail to Fort Dickerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| We are looking at constructing a greenway to connect the South Knoxville Community Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| with this property in question with a trail that's elevated along Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| It is impossible to go back to the way things used to be in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| We have encountered greater dangers in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| with an increase in heavy commercial vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| These are heavier vehicles than ever before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| These heavier vehicles are damaging the highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| We encountered serious damage to Mayfield Avenue twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| when large semi-trucks deterred off the state highway on Ogle Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| to avoid the low-clearance railroad overpass at Ogle Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| Now, the city roads are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| There are some problems with the conditions of the state highway along Ogle Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| and Maryville Pike, which is a state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| We have an interest in making the area in question a more pleasant place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| for visitors in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| We have additional serious environmental concerns due to this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| located in a floodplain with Goose Creek running through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| There would have to be a flood overlay granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| Once again, we have invested resources to protect Goose Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| with the creation of riparian zones, removal of trash and invasive vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| so the public can safely enjoy this treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| We ask that you deny this appeal from Dax Weatherspoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| to make the historical Candoro Manufacturing Property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| zoned for heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Now the appellee has an opportunity for a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1320)|
| 0:22:12| We'll just stop at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| You have up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| In regards to her response to the comment that it's not consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| with the surrounding area of being heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| again, I submit that it is when you look in either direction of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| I was there yesterday morning, probably about 11 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| and during a 30-minute window there were approximately 15 dump trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| that were coming and going from Rogers Group, which is across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| In response to the Great City Roads, that's Rogers Group that's responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| Rogers Group was the tenant for my client's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| that brought all this to our knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| Again, what we would be asking is for a split zoning on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| another desire to offer protection to the old Candoro marble buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1384)|
| 0:23:12| and so our request would be that you send this back to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| because this wasn't considered at Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Mr. Weatherspoon retained me after the Planning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| so we'd be asking that you send it back to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| for them to analyze and consider a split zoning of the IMU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| over the section of the property that has the existing three buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| and then on the vacant portion that that be considered for IH rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1415)|
| 0:23:43| Again, it's hard to always find compromises on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| and this is one that I think makes a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| and could work and serve and protect everybody's interests and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Thank you, Mr. Forster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Council, that concludes the hearing from other people portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| although you could post questions if you have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| So, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| I have a couple questions for Mr. Welch, given your new seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1447)|
| 0:24:16| There was a reference that the appellant's representative made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| to clear and sufficient notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| and I think it was apparently a claim that one of the paper notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1461)|
| 0:24:28| mailed out to the property owner went to the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Can you talk about what other clear and sufficient notice was provided during recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1472)|
| 0:24:41| I wasn't actively involved with that, Council Member Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| but we had probably 60 or 70 or more community meetings throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| at various times and locations, workshops with city council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| community neighborhood meetings, legal notices being put out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| and the city did pay for providing a letter sent to all property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| to advise on the recode aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| I couldn't tell you how many articles that were probably in the newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| or on the news about the whole rezoning process and the revisiting of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| So I don't have that exact number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| but there were probably close to 100 community meetings at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| The second one is related to adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| There are adjacent properties, I guess, on the north and south that are heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| but on the map in KGIS there are, I don't know, 11 or so properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| just to the east of that that are IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| The properties adjacent to the property in question are IH zones right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| Well, as I'm looking on KGIS and I don't know if I'm in a packet or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| but I believe there are 11 properties that are to the east of that that are IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| Oh, yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| It was quasi leading the witness, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| But I think it's important for the public to know that although the current property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| is surrounded by his own heavy industrial, there are medium industrial properties all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| I'll pause in a minute and let my colleagues ask some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| but I want to thank everybody that came and spoke tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Mr. Witherspoon, I do appreciate your role in the South Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| I know that you've also given back quite a bit to the South Knoxville community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| so regardless of this decision, I appreciate your role in South Knoxville and Vestville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| And I'm sorry you feel surprised by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Nobody wants to feel like their property was rezoned without their knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| and I do genuinely believe that you somehow missed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| With that said, RECO did have an extraordinary public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| and so there were some things that were clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| Some things were less than clear, but for the Vestville community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| there was one thing that was very clear in terms of those that spoke up a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| and that was that an intentional change to reduce the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| or excuse me, reduce the amount of heavy industrial in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| So it's not just that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| There were other properties surrounding it that are also medium industrial as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| and so I think the history in that community pointed to the future in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| And so I think the broader community wanted more medium commercial and industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| I watched the Planning Commission meeting, and I think planning got this one right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| and I think the Planning Commission got it right as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| I don't plan on supporting this appeal, but I'll pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| and let some of my colleagues ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| I want to revisit the notification to property owners that had a rezoning as it related to recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1672)|
| 0:28:02| I know that we as a council had a lot of discussion around ensuring that people did get a notification via the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| I'd like to know if that mail was returned to the planning office or whomever it came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| what was the next step of notification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| I can't answer that, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| What was returned at that time I really do not recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| I was not involved directly in that process at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| I cannot answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Do we have anyone that's in this meeting today that works in that office that would have knowledge of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| If not, I do think that we need a follow-up on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| because as it sits now, it makes me wonder, are there other people, other residents of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| who may have potentially rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| Oops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Time's up, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Are we cutting people off now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Maybe try it again now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Try it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| That's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| And Law Director Swanson may have an answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Yes, so whomever can answer that because I know that we had a really big public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| but unfortunately everyone doesn't participate for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| But I know that we were very concerned about ensuring that people that did have zoning changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| were sent something in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| So whoever can address that, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Sorry, I cannot answer the specific question about what happens if it comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| and doesn't reach the mail notice that went out if it came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| I don't really know what Planning Commission, how they handled that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| I do know that during litigation that has gone on about RICO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| we have counted, trying to remember whether it's 13 or 16, it's one of those two, 13 or 16 separate notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1792)|
| 0:30:04| that everybody who owned property received with regard to the RICO process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| and that if they had property they needed to look to see if there was going to be any change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| in the zoning of their property so that they could deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| There was also a provision put in where folks who actually had their property rezoned during the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1819)|
| 0:30:27| could, without fee, seek to have it restored to the zoning that it had for a year, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1827)|
| 0:30:39| So there have been lots of opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| I guess my concern is if this person's address was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| if those notices were sent out to an incorrect address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| fairly would there have been a mechanism for the person to actually know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| unless they went in and looked themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Unfortunately, everybody just didn't have that aptitude to do that for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I know we were entrenched in RICO because we were here on council making those decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| but I'm learning more and more that there are a lot of residents in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| that don't stay as engaged as they should if their address was in the system incorrectly for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| And I'm not just specifically about this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| but I'm thinking about other folks potentially, and this is how they find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| So I'd like for us to kind of dig a little bit deeper to see on this one, did we send it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Was it sent out 13 multiple times and continued to come back unless we were notified somehow in the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| that we were sending it to the wrong address, and I don't know how we would have identified that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| because I know that there were a lot of changes to properties and a lot of notices that went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| So I think that that's something for us to consider moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| because it's unfortunate people have to find out when it's situations like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| especially when they can prove that the notices went to the wrong address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| Again, I can't answer your specific question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| but I know that the addresses were used were the addresses where the property tax bills get sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1923)|
| 0:32:11| And we have pretty good addresses for sending out the property tax notices and the property taxes were paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1931)|
| 0:32:20| Okay, then my next question is to the attorney, I think it's Mr. Forrester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| the address where this was sent to, does your client have access to mail at that address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1945)|
| 0:32:32| Where it was addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Yeah, I guess technically not where it was addressed because that address doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Well, what he's saying is it went to N apostrophe Shore, which is sometimes used as an abbreviation for North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| Not a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Right, but it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| So is this tax information being sent to that address and being received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| Have you all received mail addressed N Shore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| Someone needs to speak into a microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| The mail, the tax stuff that we've gotten went to the South North Shore drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=1999)|
| 0:33:27| When I left the planning commission, I went upstairs and was asking questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| and the lady that was behind the counter who said that she does the mailings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| she's the one that gave us that piece of paper and said, you know, it probably went to this N Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2017)|
| 0:33:46| And she goes, that's probably why you did not get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| So, you know, yes, we do get our tax bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| And also that day went downstairs and changed it all to a P.O. box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| So she said it probably went there, but she wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| She wasn't totally for sure, but she gave us that printout and said, more than likely, this is where it went to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Well, that's what I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| I want to elaborate on that point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Just a moment, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| So someone told you they supposition they guessed that it went to said address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| but they have no evidence or known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| There's nothing definitive to say it was mailed to that address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| According to the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| According to the lady at the Planning Commission, you know, I asked her and I gave her the correct address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| And she goes, well, it could have been gone to this address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| And that's when she printed it off and handed it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Mr. Johnson, it is my recollection, because I've looked at them physically myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| that the returned letters are stored in the council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| And you have looked for this specific returned letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| The Planning Commission staff member asked us to search for this one, and we were unable to locate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Did you happen to notice if any of them were addressed in Comma Shore instead of North Shore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| You don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| I know they're there because I've had council staff pull from the stack myself before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Mr. Swanson, you said in other legal proceedings on this issue that there have been cited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2139)|
| 0:35:47| I think you just said 13, 16, I don't remember what number you noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| You don't remember the number because I don't remember the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| I said it was either 13 or 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| It's one of those two numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Times that property owners were noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| I think I recall, can you elaborate on any of those notices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| It wasn't just this one letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| There was other notices that went out with tax bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Yes, there were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| I mean, I got notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Also, there were different notices that went out with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| I got multiple notices that, you know, go to this address, look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| Your property is going to be potentially rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| We're doing a citywide rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| That was a two-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| It started before some of us were running for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| And then I believe it was Vice Mayor Roberto that made the motion for us to send out the letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| to give an extra blanket of notice on top of all the other notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| And then we also made the process where you had up to a year for a free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2202)|
| 0:36:51| and I don't know if there's, for a free rezoning or a review, for a review, not a guaranteed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| but a review of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| I don't know if there's anybody from planning or on the city staff that would remember how many of those we reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| but I would say it's above 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| And I could start citing specific ones along the Broadway corridor and up in some of the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| in the Fountain City area where we heard those here at council in that year afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| So there was quite a lot of public process and opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| There was tons of notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| So I get it that people don't notice, but we made a lot of effort to make sure people were aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2247)|
| 0:37:36| The other thing I would like to say is I realize that there is heavy industrial south and north of this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2256)|
| 0:37:46| and I discussed this with Mr. Forrester when he contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| We have other instances in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Traditionally, it was pretty common to have heavy industrial uses along rail lines and have housing not too far from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2273)|
| 0:38:02| People walked to their jobs in the mills and places that were served by the railroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| As the industrial revolution has moved to the rear view window, we've moved away from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| and we've had some really negative consequences to that to residential areas in the city, particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| I don't want to speak for Mr. Thomas, but in his area, there was a terrible fire that went for a good week or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| and did a lot of damage to people's health and homes to have heavy industrial abutting housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| And there's a lot of houses in two directions around this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| and I would say I'm surprised that there's still so much heavy industrial in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| So I cannot in good conscience support more heavy industrial near people's homes based on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2326)|
| 0:38:55| just the things that have happened since I've been on council north of Woodland area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you. Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| A couple of things. I am going to go back to the address for a minute because I'm on a personal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| So looking at it was addressed to North Shore or in Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| Actually, my mother happens to live at this address in a different unit, and it's actually South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2362)|
| 0:39:30| So I can tell you, and there's also a North North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| which we know North Shore really traverses the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| So I'm just going to say that, you know, there have been instances in her case where it has been an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2381)|
| 0:39:50| because of A, the ends of North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| and then essentially apparently there doesn't exist a Shore Drive, hence a North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| So anyway, I just needed to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| I spent a long time talking to really all the stakeholders in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| I've spent an hour out on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| and just, you know, really trying to collect all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| And I do kind of scratch my head when you walk the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| how you've got virtually 46 acres that was heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| and then really in the middle only six acres somehow became down zone to mixed-use industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2433)|
| 0:40:43| And I understand the Candora site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| and I will just say that I have overwhelming gratitude for the historic preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| for the investment that Aslan Foundation has made in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| And I know that, you know, their hope ultimately is to be able to restore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| and revitalize the entire Candora Marble site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| And so, you know, I hope down the road that that ultimately can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2472)|
| 0:41:21| And I think my understanding is Mr. Witherspoon is amenable to moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| but it's heavy industrial, so you've got to find somewhere to go before you can vacate the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| There's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Whether this passes or not tonight, I just, there are some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| I spent some time on the phone with Roger's group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| who ultimately are the ones who are in need of use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| As we all know on council, they hold our city contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| They also have the county contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| and they also have this very monumental I-640 contract, which is short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| But it's also, you know, the company that is addressing the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| and upgrade of our road systems in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| And in my conversation with him, a couple of things that I feel like need to be taken into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2537)|
| 0:42:25| and I hope that if, you know, moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| that there can continue to be some discussion and compromise on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| because basically what they said is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| it would be a detriment to their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| and require hauling approximately twice the distance of this aggregate to Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| versus 50 yards across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| And doubling the length of haul not only would take substantially longer, time is money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| but it would also strain their already finite resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| meaning they would have to pull workers off other jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| hence potentially delaying all the jobs that they're contracted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| There's also the five acre where they're currently using right now, which is heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| There's a creek crossing that property, but, you know, a potential solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| and this might be directed at Mr. Welch, is the front part of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| could potentially still be used, but there would have to then be created access off of Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| So to that point, I mean, you know, they still may have access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| but it really creates a hindrance to their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| if there isn't able to come up with some kind of solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| because it's a temporary project with the I-640 that they're really looking to remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| So I'll stop there for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| Thank you. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Thank you, Mayor. Just two more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I know the city's invested in heavy industrial areas in certain areas of the city where we do want that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| and I don't want Mr. Witherspoon to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| There's plenty of property there, I think, for operations to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| but either Deputy Gill or someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| can you speak to the heavy industrial areas of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| where the city has intentionally encouraged that type of use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| I'm happy to try to take a stab at it, and then Deputy Brace may step in as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| but as you council members know, you know, we have a variety of industrial areas around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| The one that comes to mind immediately around a rail line especially is in the I-275 corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| that has rail access as well as highway access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| and it's an area where we've seen investment by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| to make sure that there's continued industrial use in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| Councilman Smith, I don't necessarily have my head in the inventory of all our I-H properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| but certainly there's been intentionality by the city to ensure that we have continued opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| for industrial uses throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| Anything to add, Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| No, the timing is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Actually, Mr. Weth, who's here, and I were down at Dow Chemical today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| which is one of our big employers in Knoxville, heavy industrial on a rail line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| right in the middle of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| I think you can look at industrial typically follows major corridors, interstates, rail lines, the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| and so we were there today just checking in, making sure that they had what they needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| connections at the chamber, so we value, highly value those industries and that land use is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| The second comment is I worked on North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| so I appreciate that sometimes things do get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| I do understand, though, that as Councilwoman Ryder pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| we receive those return notices when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| So for whatever reason, that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| I think there's significant opportunity for anyone to hear about RECA over the past two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| I also think it's possible for people to miss it because life's busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| But if you own commercial property, there was a substantial community input process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| and I just want to remind Council that the very clear message from the entire vessel community was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2769)|
| 0:46:17| the future is not the past as it relates to heavy industrial and the use of land in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| and the desire for its future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| There's an arts community bubbling up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| There are significant environmental wounds of that city, that part of the town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| that I don't think I need to remind anybody of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| and I think that there was a very clear direction from that community that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| we want something different in the future than we had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| So I'll pause again for any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| I just have a practical question, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| So this all started because Rogers Group needed space, wanted to rent warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| When we went to do that and pulled the permits is when it's not in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| But we know they don't need them long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| We also know that the community does not want it the same zone long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| I'm just wondering, I mean, how long do they need them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Is there a way to accommodate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| If it were to not maintain the industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2846)|
| 0:47:36| is there a way to be given a short-term exception to keep the aggregate there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| while this project's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| That may be too complicated a question, and we can't figure that out today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| but I'm just asking because what I'm hearing is, pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| I don't mean to put down Mr. Forrester's client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| but are you asking about a temporary illegal use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| I'm asking, yes, it would be if we change the zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| but is there something that you can do to allow a year and then it be rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| I'm just asking because it seems like I'm looking for a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| rather than a winner and a loser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| And what I'm hearing is, I absolutely agree, the community does not want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| I understand that 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| But I also understand that we have a need by the Rogers Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| and it could be beneficial to our city for them to be able to have their aggregate close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| Unless somebody's got another place they can put it, I'm just asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| is there a way to make a solution and can smarter minds than mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| who have more time to think about this, come up with a solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| Mr. Forrester, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| I would be agreeable to that if there's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| There's a way to accomplish that because we do look at this as a shelf life agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| And Ms. Frost, illegal is a little aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| I'd say maybe nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Yeah, nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| I am not an attorney, and I did not sleep at a Holiday Inn Express,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| but I think there is, you know the commercials that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| Andy is looking at me like she doesn't know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| She hasn't watched a lot of TV lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Now, bad joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| I'm trying to lighten the mood here, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| I don't know what to do other than to ask for a postponement for this to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2971)|
| 0:49:44| Otherwise, you know, I don't want it to stay zoned the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| but I also don't want to cause an undue hardship for some projects that we as the city would benefit from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2989)|
| 0:49:58| if the aggregate was close and our costs didn't go up for travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| And then I'll go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Yeah, so I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| I believe that, hang on, let me say something accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| Mr. Witherspoon said something about existing use that was already there on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| and when new permits were applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Was there not an existing nonconforming use on that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| Was there Mr. Welch or somebody from the city that would know the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| Mr. Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| There's no Mr. Ahrens here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Who's the zoning administrator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| I don't think that it was in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| I mean, it's been a vacant piece of property, so the land use is there, but it hasn't been in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| It's just been vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| But a nonconforming use would have lapsed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Mr. Witherspoon, do you mind coming back to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| What were you saying at one point when you spoke after Mr. Forrester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| You were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Tell me again the history use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| Roger's Group has two properties that literally are on one side of us and one on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3071)|
| 0:51:19| The one side of Kandor where their asphalt plant is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| we rent them property there to store the ground-up asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| They came to us and said, hey, we need more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| That's your parcel on the south side of Kandor, 719 Maryville Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| That abuts Roger's Group's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| There's three lots there that we rent to Roger's Group now to store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| They're aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| On the, I guess you would say the major building sides of Kandor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| they came to us and said, hey, we need about three acres for this upcoming project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3119)|
| 0:52:07| Would you rent us that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| And we all were understanding that it was I-4 or the new H-4, the heavy industrial, to store the aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3131)|
| 0:52:20| And we stored or we have on the property some steel and other items that we store outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3140)|
| 0:52:31| And we said, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| So we moved them, and they went into the process of getting the permits and the stormwater permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3152)|
| 0:52:41| And then they came back to us and said, hey, you're not zoned for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| We can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| And I had already signed a contract with them for five years with a five-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3167)|
| 0:52:56| They came to me and stated that, you know, we probably only need it for about three to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3176)|
| 0:53:04| So three to four years, not a year, to go to Ms. Fugate's conversation previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| So what it was is we were basing it off of the contract that we have with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| the agreement on the other side of the street where their asphalt plant is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| You know, we did a five-year lease with a five-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| So we were like, okay, let's just do the same type of lease for over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| even though they're thinking that they should be done within four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| So, Mr. Witherspoon, so the property was fallow, unused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| except for you had stored outdoor storage of steel and other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Mr. Welch or anybody, that is not, that's allowed on industrial mix use, not on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| it doesn't require IH or like the storage of materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| I don't believe it's allowed under the IMU that they currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| So he had an existing non-conforming use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| It doesn't matter that he didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| He had an existing non-conforming use on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| I guess I'm just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| We've had things in the past where there's existing non-conforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| and until that use goes away, it's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| I mean, there's stockpiles of marble there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| Mr. Witherspoon, my time's going to run out, but he's used a bit of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| So, Mr. Witherspoon, quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| You own the property south of Rogers Group at 901 Merrillville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| and it is zoned heavy industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Actually, I don't own that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Though your name's on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| It is in the, it would be in the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| And it is tied up right now with the state of Tennessee and the Department of Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| And until the state of Tennessee signs off saying that they are happy with what Department of Energy has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3304)|
| 0:55:15| we cannot use that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| We've been paying taxes on it, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3317)|

| 0:55:42| I'm going to assume that's because of environmental or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3345)|

| 0:55:48| Ms. Rogers, you want, why don't we let, we'll go to Ms. Testerman and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| Okay, so back to my Rogers group discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3360)|
| 0:56:08| First of all, when they went to get a permit for the parcel that they are using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3368)|
| 0:56:16| which is just east of this parcel in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| they came to the city who in turn, I guess, made them buy a building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| even though they weren't building anything, but in order for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| He did say that he would, he couldn't be here tonight, I did ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| that their hope is to be done with the I-640 project by the end of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| You know, some of the storage issue is that you can only use a percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| and this would be my engineering friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| but could only use a percentage of the aggregate for the new asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| and then they continue to recycle just to simplify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| But at any rate, their intent is really to be out as soon as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| as soon as they can complete this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| So it really is of temporary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| And I ask the same question, Council Member Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| is there ever, has there ever been anything as a temporary zoning for a circumstance like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3438)|
| 0:57:28| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| I am all about the historic preservation of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| and the growth and the transformation and the revitalization that's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3452)|
| 0:57:40| but also the concrete plant's not going anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| the asphalt company is not going anywhere, I would say in perpetuity to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3463)|
| 0:57:51| So again, I'm just here to try and find a solution as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| to see how we can try and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| allow an individual to use this property as it has been for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| And I guess with his current use and the storage of the buildings on the Kandora site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3488)|
| 0:58:16| I mean, I presume he's grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Is that correct or not, Mr. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| It would be a non-conforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| but he would not be able to expand any of its uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| or expand any of the buildings in that as a non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| But as the buildings that he's using currently for storage now, I mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| Well, again, if he made major alterations or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| that would not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| I'm just looking for a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| I don't have any other questions, and my colleagues don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| I'll make a motion to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3536)|

| 1:01:16| to determine if the use is consistent with adopted plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3680)|

| 1:01:25| the use is potentially incompatible with existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3685)|

| 1:01:32| And you may deny or must deny a use that significantly injures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| the value of adjacent property or by noise, lights, fumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3696)|

| 1:01:49| As a threshold matter, we object to this redevelopment as being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| inconsistent with the West City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| The plan recommends the redevelopment of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| corridors in the CG zone should be accommodated under planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| or design-oriented zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| This redevelopment is inconsistent with that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| because it's not being accommodated under a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3728)|

| 1:02:14| To understand why the drive-through is incompatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| with Dr. Pittman's veterinary clinic and will injure Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| Pittman's property, you need to know that these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| share a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| The driveway easement was established by agreement in 1983.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| The agreement also entitles Dr. Pittman to eight parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| at the rear of the neighboring property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Most of the driveway is within feet of Dr. Pittman's building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| The shared driveway must accommodate two-way traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| because it is the only way to access the rear of both properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| Dr. Pittman's patients use the driveway to deliver their sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| and injured pets to the only ADA-accessible entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| at the back of Dr. Pittman's building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| It's estimated that the drive-through facility will generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| a tenfold increase in vehicular traffic on the shared driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| This increased traffic will injure Dr. Pittman's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| and detract from the immediate environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| for all the reasons listed in Section 16.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| We also object because the plan does not appear to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3798)|

| 1:03:30| Our survey accurately locates the shared driveway easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| along the existing edge of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| Accurately locating the driveway easement results in a drive aisle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| of only 16 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Allowing this plan to move forward would be a clear violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| of Section 11.5B and Table 11.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| of the City of Knoxville Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| Those sections require a minimum drive aisle of 26 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| for two-way traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| Because the plan doesn't meet the minimum aisle width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| it cannot accommodate the three parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| proposed along the shared driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| Knoxville's off-street parking regulations require a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| of 11 parking spaces for this proposed custard shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| The plan shows only 10 parking spaces available for the custard shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| after losing three parking spaces to the drive aisle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| and another eight parking spaces designated for Dr. Pittman's use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| We've also provided you with an expert report prepared by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| Alan Parham, a traffic engineer with significant experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| analyzing vehicular and pedestrian-related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| Mr. Parham found that the design of this plan did not factor in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| traffic operations as part of the site design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| If constructed as designed, both the Animal Wellness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| and Rehabilitation Center and the new restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| will be significantly and negatively affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| He concluded that the proposed site design for an Andy's Frozen Custard restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| at 6217 Kingston Pike would significantly injure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| the adjacent building and business at 6221 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| We have Mr. Parham here tonight, and we also have Dr. Pittman here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| who would like to address the Council, and I suppose we'll get some time for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| Thank you. The next person can come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| and you'll have up to five minutes to speak to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| Please start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| Good evening. My name is Alan Parham, P-A-R-H-A-M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| My address is 253 South Peters Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| I was asked to evaluate this, as I am a lot of properties and conditions involving traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| and I won't take up the whole five minutes, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| But anyway, what I found was that the existing property, as it is or as it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| was a furniture store, and they had about 103 to plus or minus trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| This proposed restaurant is going to project to have 941 trips per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3972)|
| 1:06:20| so that's about 9 to 10 times the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| Now, these are rough numbers, and they can vary time of day and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| but this is what we have to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| The next thing is, well, that's an 841% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3990)|
| 1:06:37| That's a lot of traffic on this, and I don't know if you all are familiar with this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| but the area that Mr. Sanders was talking about that shares this driveway between the two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| is very narrow, and to put two lanes of traffic through there, plus pedestrian usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| would be very, very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| So what I looked at was, and I think it may be in the package that was submitted to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| is the pedestrian conflicts and vehicular conflicts and vehicular-vehicle conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| and I've got these detailed out at the hotspots around the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| and there are two that primarily come to mind with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| One is where the drive-through, the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| the way it comes through and exits from the restaurant area, it comes in at a very skewed angle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| and it would be entering the two-way driveway, going back and forth between the two properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4048)|
| 1:07:37| as well as near a parking facility that would be accommodating pedestrians and their animals as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4057)|
| 1:07:47| By having this narrow angle, meaning the driver that would be entering the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| or this driveway from the drive-through would have to look way over their shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| and if you have a pickup truck or something, a van that you can't see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| you couldn't see oncoming traffic, so that's a hazard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| and people will be coming in from Kingston Pike, and also it's very congested there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| The next location is just south of there, and it's where a parking lot is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| with an existing parking lot for the vet hospital, and then you're going to have traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| two-way traffic, you're going to have pedestrians, and then the traffic exiting from the drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| as well as people entering from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| Again, this is a very congested area where you have a lot of conflict points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| So I think that's covered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| I'm trying to get through all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| Excuse the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Okay, the next one would be the narrowness between the two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| I touched on this a minute ago, but this is very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| If you've all been there or you can see it, there's no room for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| It's hard to get two vehicles through there beside each other now because it's only 16 to 17 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| and the plan tries to widen it, and I'm not getting into the surveying on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| but it needs to accommodate not only the traffic but a buffer space between the vehicles and a walking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| There is no access to the front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| The main access is on the side of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| and so pedestrians would have to walk along this narrow area to be able to access the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4161)|
| 1:09:30| The thing that really struck me when I was looking at this is it doesn't appear that any traffic coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| or traffic flow plan was considered when this design was laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| I'm not trying to be critical or anything other than just factual that this seems to be trying to shoehorn too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| into too small of a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| I'm not saying that the business couldn't work in another way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| but the way it's laid out now is very dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| and I think not only would it injure the animal hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| I think that it would ultimately injure people who wouldn't want to go to the custard shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| because of the congestion involved with it, and furthermore, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| I think there will be some personal injuries involved in this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Is there a third person who wishes to speak in favor of this appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| Please start by saying your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| I'm Amanda Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| My husband and I own the property at 6221 Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| and also the business which resides within it, which is Animal Wellness and Rehab Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| Animal Wellness was opened at that location in March of 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| and was established then and still is currently the only integrative animal hospital in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| and also within 100 miles of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| We are also the only operational therapy center for animals outside of the College of Veterinary Medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| and definitely the only one in private practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| So people drive from many states away to use our unique combination of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| When they come here from Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, they are staying in hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| They are shopping locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| They are definitely driving tourism to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| We provide a valuable service to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| We treat animals with a combination of care that can't be accessed elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| And we also give back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| We have a shelter dog program and a service dog program, which we're very proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4293)|
| 1:11:40| When we first heard about this, we were very nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| We have no opposition at all to an ice cream shop next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| certainly no opposition to Andy's in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| But the driveway, as you've heard, is extremely narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| and more than 75% of our patients are disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| So that as a doctor, the first oath is we do no harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| So already, you know, I'm feeling like my patients will be harmed just coming to our space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| The opposition that I have is to the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| So this is a special use request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| So my understanding of the special use is that we have to prove that it's not going to endanger the adjacent business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4332)|
| 1:12:20| And I think we've shown you through the survey and also the traffic engineering report that that would be likely to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| We definitely already have clients nervous about this that would not want to bring their pets to a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| where they felt like they couldn't cross traffic with their dogs that are in wheelchairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| or for my team members that have to bring them across in gurneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| For me, there's really only three things to consider here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| The first is, as a special use, does this fit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| And we've shown you that it does not fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| The minimum drive aisle width cannot be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| The second is, is it safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| The traffic engineer has shown you that it is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| There will be uncontrolled five-way traffic, multiple vehicular and pedestrian conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4379)|
| 1:13:06| For those of you that do not know the area, we're right on top of Bearden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| And we are almost directly across the street from Dean Hill and just a block from Wise Garber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| and one block more from North Shore, so the convergence of traffic there is extremely heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| And it can often take about five minutes just to turn left out of our parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| I can't even imagine what that turns into with all of this other traffic that we're expecting with this custard shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4406)|
| 1:13:34| It has been proposed by the custard shop that they would be complimentary to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| due to their business hours versus our business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| To say that their peak hours are different than our peak hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| greatly diminishes my potential to grow as a business and expand my own hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| We are hiring our third veterinarian in November and expected to increase our hours on later nights and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| So it's not really fair to limit me in that way and say that I can't expand my hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| because they're there and their peak hours are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| We're the existing local small family-owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| And from what I understand, Andy's is coming and building four locations in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| So the final concern that I have is that let's say Andy's location, this location, doesn't work out and they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| Now we have a precedent set in that area so that what prevents a Chick-fil-A with even heavier traffic from coming in after they leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| This special use, if permitted, will absolutely create a precedence for the future that would harm our business further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4473)|
| 1:14:41| And finally, I'm also very concerned about the value of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| If this drive-through is permitted, I will be likely forced to move so that I can protect the safety of my patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| And if that happens, I will now be faced with a shared driveway with a fast food restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| and what other office or medical-zoned facility would want to pay the value that it currently is if there's a shared driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4499)|
| 1:15:07| That's going to greatly decrease the value of our property and therefore the sale of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| whether I leave tomorrow or in 20 years from now when I retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Now the parties in opposition to this have the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| We have three people signed up, starting with Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| You have up to five minutes and then the other speakers can have their five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 3719.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4535)|
| 1:15:44| Here on behalf of Andy's Frozen Custard and Mr. Tom Gass, in opposition to this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4544)|
| 1:15:52| as record reflects that this matter was considered for special use review by the Planning Commission in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4552)|
| 1:16:00| and it was a near-unanimous decision of 10 to 1 approving the proposed special use of Andy's Frozen Custard Shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4560)|
| 1:16:08| which it's really the drive-through that's being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| It's not the actual use of it as a custard shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| As noted in the staff report, when considering special use review, we're guided by the principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4576)|
| 1:16:25| and have to rely on the principles and the standards set forth in the zoning ordinance in Article 16.2.F.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4585)|
| 1:16:33| Those standards are described and expanded on in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4593)|
| 1:16:43| As noted in the staff report, planning staff found that the proposed use of a drive-through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| was in fact consistent with the one-year plan and the sector plan for property, zone, general, commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| This area, Kingston Pike, is a heavily trafficked commercial corridor and there are a wide range of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| In fact, there's a drive-through, the Krispy Kreme Donuts drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| We're separated by one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| Planning staff also found that the use is in harmony with the CG Zoning District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| The CG Zoning District is a mix of retail, commercial, office, and even, in fact, residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| They found that the use is compatible with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Multiple eating and drinking establishments on this section of Kingston Pike, as well as other varied uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| Also determined that there was no significant injury to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| Any noise, light, fumes, traffic resulting from the proposed development would be minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4658)|
| 1:17:46| and not injurious to the neighboring property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| Speaking on the hours of operation, I believe it is imperative to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| 80% of Andy's business is done after dinner during the week and on weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| which, using common sense, that seems logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| I mean, when do people go and get ice cream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| When do they go and get frozen desserts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| It's either after dinner, sometime over the weekend, usually late afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| and Dr. Pittman is not open, so we'd submit that it would be more of a compatible business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| When she's open, we're not busy, and when we're busy, she's not open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4703)|
| 1:18:32| In response to Mr. Sanders' point, the shared driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| we have the ability to modify or expand the access to some degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4716)|
| 1:18:46| in order to comply with the requirements of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| We submit that our site plan accurately reflects the location of the shared driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| This is even evidenced in Dr. Pittman's use on review approval from 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| where on her site plan, she showed the shared driveway exactly where we show it on our site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| and it's only now saying it's no longer that wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| Part of it is Dr. Pittman's landscaping impermissibly encroaches into the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4757)|
| 1:19:24| that is limited for driveway traffic only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| Mr. Sanders contends that the drive-thru violates the office street parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| and he's referring to those three parking spaces towards the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| going towards the drive-thru on our project, on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| We can get rid of those. That minimizes the drive aisle width from 26 feet to 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| and we'll be able to meet that 20-foot width requirement to serve as the driveway for the drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4787)|
| 1:19:59| As far as any trespass on Dr. Pittman's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| he was citing and referring to the dumpster on our site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| We can relocate the dumpster. There's no issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| We will not conduct any unauthorized construction or demolition on Dr. Pittman's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| Dr. Pittman will continue to have access to the eight parking spaces pursuant to the easement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| We've accounted for those on our site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| We dispute the dangerous points of conflict raised by the traffic engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| I put in my letter some location to consider as the Starbucks and Kroger there in Bearden off of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4829)|
| 1:20:38| Mr. Forster, that concludes your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| Next person is Tom Gass. Mr. Gass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| Hello, all. Tom Gass with Andy's Frozen Custard, 118 North Peters, Suite 244, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4846)|
| 1:21:00| I'm the franchisee with Andy's Frozen Custard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| We're from southwest Missouri, still a family-owned business there in southwest Missouri owned by the Kuntz family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| We probably opened store number 113 in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| We are the franchisees for the Knoxville, Sevierville area to build in the next six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4876)|
| 1:21:25| And, yes, we will be building several in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| I'd like to say that I don't know where they get their numbers for more than 900 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| We're currently doing about 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| Some of our smaller, some of our other stores within our groupings would die to have 900 a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| so I don't know where they came up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| So as far as how many trips are going to be coming up, they've got that significantly wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| Though we will be doing quite a bit of business, we're primarily a walk-up and drive-through facility only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4915)|
| 1:22:04| We are open from 11 in the morning until 11 in the evening, 12 o'clock on the weekends for summer hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| 1130 on the weekends during the regular hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| We come here to be entrenched, my wife and I and our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| We've come, we've entrenched ourselves here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| We've been here a year ago, March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| We moved into the area, really looking forward to being a part of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| opening up about anywhere from 25 to 30 jobs per location as we open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| We're trying to pepper them across the area so as we don't conflict with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| Bearden Hill is where we'd like to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| We feel it's a beautiful location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| And knowing what I know with regards to the several that I've gone to visit in multiple states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| and also the time that I spent in southwest Missouri,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| we're very compatible with a lot of different high-volume, low-volume trafficked businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| Our business currently in Sevierville, we're co-located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| We're on a .7-acre piece ourselves, and right next to us is Dunkin' Donuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| You know what kind of volume Dunkin' Donuts does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| We have a 26-foot easement between us by nature of what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| We could have gone with a 20-foot easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| We have no conflicts with the way that it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Everyone has a turnout of their drive-through right into the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| almost identical to what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| This was a well-thought-out and worked-through with our civil engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| and presented back to the planning and zoning and to all of the people that we had to bring it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| And in a 10-to-1, they said they saw no reason for us not to be able to have the use of a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5021)|
| 1:23:50| It wasn't the final plan that we were submitting to be building from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| We would work from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| Many of the points that was brought up by Ms. Pittman's attorney did bring notice to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5036)|
| 1:24:04| and the first thing we wanted to do was address those and try and make those work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| Removing three parking spaces on that aisle would make it a more narrow aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| Moving her eight spots to an easier point that would actually make it easier with one-way traffic back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| for them to be able to walk over to her place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| She has submitted back special use in 2017 as to where her drop-off is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| It's behind her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| It's not between us and her, and she can still do that, actually, more clearly than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5069)|
| 1:24:38| We reached out to her via e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| One of our people from our real estate stopped by to say, hey, can we talk to you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| They really wanted nothing to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| and we've been working very hard to help flush out what we believe will then go to the planning and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| and back through permitting before we can even start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| So though it was a ask for a special use, we gave everything that we felt was asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5098)|
| 1:25:05| and at a 10-to-1 voted yes, it obviously met all the criteria through the city itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5105)|
| 1:25:13| to even be brought to that special use and zone look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| So I think from our standpoint, it works perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| Semis have been up that aisleway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| There's plenty of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| The parking that he's talking about down front has been there since 1984,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| and there has never, that I know of, been issues or conflicts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| And Ms. Pittman does have walkways for her people to get from her handicapped parking to her building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| not being on the easement, which is not reflected in any of her drawings, but she does have it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| So I think, you know, we just ask, please look at all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| Thank you, Mr. Gass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| Next person signed up to speak in opposition is Tony Cappiella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| You could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| He's got something to submit to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| I'll back a little bit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5169)|
| 1:26:24| You can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| Should I wait until it's surpassed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| You can state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| They'll have time to look at it while you talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| My name is Tony Cappiella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| My residence is 3747 Kingston Pike here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| I'm having a letter passed out that I had sent to members of council earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| but I'm going to give you a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| It has some photographs you might want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| Just a brief background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| I grew up here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| I live in Bearden with my family, my wife and daughter, and my office is on Highlands Row in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5215)|
| 1:27:05| My focus has been the last few years to help revitalize Bearden and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| I listen to residents and try to bring new activities, new restaurants, and new retail into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| In this case, I listened to my daughter, and she told me she and her friends needed more ice cream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| So I think Tom, I'm sure she meant custard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| What we really have here this evening is the tail wagging the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| I've been waiting two weeks to say that, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| Pardon the pun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| But for nearly five years, Dr. Pittman has enjoyed the use of her third of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| while my seven-tenths of an acre next door has remained vacant for most of the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| the property of which I've owned and then Arnwine's had closed down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| which was a furniture store, for about 30-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| In that time, by her own omission, letter to counsel, she has doubled her veterinarian business every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| She has turned a small veterinarian clinic of 2,400 square feet into a veterinarian hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| Those are her words, not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| Of course, I don't think the property is currently zoned for a hospital use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| When I think of a veterinary hospital, I think of UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| I think of emergency care and animals around the clock being brought there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| My understanding, Dr. Pittman, as we've talked about already, only is open until 6 p.m. and not on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5307)|
| 1:28:34| My family is full of animal lovers, and my wife and I and now my daughter have run raccoons, birds, geese,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5314)|
| 1:28:43| even a fox to my chagrined UT hospital because they were injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| I say that to say that I appreciate and respect what Dr. Pittman does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| and yet every parking space, if you look at the photographs, is full all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5332)|
| 1:28:59| She is adding another veterinarian by her own omission in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| and frankly the third of an acre in her 2,400 square foot building just cannot accommodate the business she has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5345)|
| 1:29:11| and especially if she intends to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| You might ask, why has she not bought my property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| Well, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| In 2019 we had an agreement that she was going to buy the property, but for personal reasons she decided not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| And then interestingly, I hired a company to market my property, a real estate company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| and in March she had her agent, John Lyle, call and ask perhaps to buy it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| I've never received an offer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| So instead, I think what's happening here is I've tried several attempts to lease my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| but she seems to be always in opposition to anything I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| First, let me give you a few examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| I had a luxury boutique car dealership that wanted to store 15 cars inside the furniture store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| high-end cars with maybe a couple outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| No repairs were going to be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| But we had to get a variance because there's not a special classification for that kind of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| so it kind of fell under a car dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| So we went to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| The only person to oppose that was Dr. Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| She thought that the delivery of an automobile by truck would be disruptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| Secondly, I tried to bring a Halloween store to the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| It was only a three-month kind of pop-up store, and I needed some help to pay taxes and my mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5423)|
| 1:30:30| Once again, Dr. Pittman called the police on the employees, and I had even two officers call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| The third, which I think is the most remarkable, is during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| I let Dancer Studio, I donated the space for their annual children's recital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| Ms. Lynn, who was supposed to be here this evening, has run that for 60 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| and to her shock, Dr. Pittman forced and insisted that parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| and children park across the street at Central Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| They had to walk across Kingston Pike to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| So the fact of the matter is we'd like to be good neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| but the problem is I don't think Dr. Pittman wants to be a neighbor at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| and she certainly doesn't want any of my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| So we, as you heard, have agreed to do certain things to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| The drive-through is on the four corners of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| We've closed the three parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| We've moved the dumpster enclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| We want to be good citizens, and we want to share the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| and the platted easement together without having disputes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| The appellant will have up to a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5503)|
| 1:31:51| Thank you, Daniel Sanders, Niner-Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| In rebuttal, yes, Dr. Pittman values her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| When someone tries to overutilize or take advantage of her to get a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| from the regulations that apply to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| or to apply for a special use that your zoning ordinance identifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| as causing problems for neighboring property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| she will fight back, and that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| I don't think that anyone should be besmirched or looked down upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| by trying to protect what property they have in their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5549)|
| 1:32:38| Planning Commission's recommendation, quite honestly, isn't worth a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| This morning I got an email, and I don't mean that in a bad way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| I mean that it's based on inaccurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| This morning I got an email from Mr. Welch from Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| That Planning Commission recommendation was based on the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| that it would generate 400 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| I got an email this morning, and the actual number is going to be 941.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| Mr. Welch can confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| Planning Commission made that recommendation without the accurate trip numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| without the survey, without our expert opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| You are sitting in a de novo hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| and I don't know what's in Mr. Cappiello's letter that you've just received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| I didn't receive a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| I just saw it passed out to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Apparently he emailed that to you earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| But it appears to me that he has taken every advantage of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| and I think Dr. Pittman wants to come up and address something that happened during.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| I'm sorry, the two minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| I mean you have four seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| Well, apparently during one of Mr. Cappiello's events that he was leasing the property out to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| someone actually did get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Their foot got ran over and they broke their leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Thank you, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| If council members have questions, they can ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| Mr. Forrester, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| Given the design, how many cars can accommodate this drive-thru facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| given the plans that you've put together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| So if you're thinking about all of the customers who might be in line for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| Just stacked in the drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| Yeah, if you were at full capacity without getting into the easement, how many cars could you fit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| It's at 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| That's what the 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| 11, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| That would be on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| So that's not encroaching in easements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| That would not be on the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| The way that wraps around there and then snakes back is what allows and accommodates that many cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Director Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| We heard from Attorney Sanders today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| He raised some issues about this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| And I think pretty much what he spoke about today is the same issues that he talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| in his letter from September 20th, if I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| Now, I know I asked you to look at that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| Have you had a chance to review that letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| Based on, and I know you may have had to speak with other departments as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| because not everything that was contained in there was specific to engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| but based on your review, can you walk council through what your thoughts were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| about the various issues that were raised in that letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| I guess one of the first issues is access with this shared use easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5746)|
| 1:35:55| There's two recorded plats that reflect a 25-foot easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5755)|
| 1:36:02| That's also shown on their concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| We also received a survey they're referring to from Benny Moorman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| that really identifies the existing asphalt as it exists today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| which I think the narrowest point of that is 16.8 feet between the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| Mr. Clabo, can you pull the mic down a key here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| So from our perspective, the existing easement as platted would be 25 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5784)|
| 1:36:32| as shown correctly on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| There appears to be some issue between property owners on exactly what that easement is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5795)|
| 1:36:42| but the plat does reflect 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| As far as the conflict points that are indicated on the traffic engineering plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5806)|
| 1:36:53| those are really typical of any parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| The existing parking on really both properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| there's existing parking lots on the north and south ends of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| So all the conflict points shown in those areas exist today if both buildings were active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5824)|
| 1:37:11| Really the only new point of conflict would be the drive-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| and we feel like with proper signage and marking that that could be accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| So was there anything in your review of the letter or the discussion you've heard today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| that would make you feel like this use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| the special use that's being brought up here would be somehow unsafe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| and different from other uses that you see on Kinsta Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| I just have a hard time supporting this appeal based on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| the review of what happened at Planning Commission, the reports from planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| I think they probably got this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| I appreciate Director Clabo clarifying these points with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| I'll make a motion after my colleagues get a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| Mr. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| Yes, I just have one question for Director Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| We have heard some figures about the added trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| I think I heard 400, then I heard 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| What's the assessment from the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| I wish there was a correct answer, and there is not, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| We use the Institute of Transportation Engineers as an estimate for trip generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| which is a nationally acceptable process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| There are only six studies nationally, no studies for custard shops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| so we use the coffee shop, and there are only six studies nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| They range from 400 up to 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| Three studies were less than 1,500 square feet approximately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| but this is where our estimate that we provided to Mr. Sanders and to Mr. Forrester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5931)|
| 1:39:00| is that it could be in the range of about 400 to 500 trips per day for this particular use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| is where those three sites, three analysis points were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| So we're looking at somewhere in the 400 to 600 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| But I think the testimony from the owner of the custard shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| who experienced this in reality, may be more accurate than these estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| Seeing no more questions from my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| I certainly agree with the planning staff here and will make a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| Motion made to deny has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| Seeing none, all those in favor of the motion to deny, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| Motion to deny carries 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| Council Members, do you want to take a brief recess before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Let's reconvene at 7-50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| I'd like to call this meeting back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6003)|

| 1:41:07| but I just want to say I'm really excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| A lot of people have been talking about the federal infrastructure bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| and wondering what that means for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| Well, what it means is we are allowed to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| and we are applying for this grant, the Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| and it's specifically to address the harm that was caused during the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| of urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| So if funded, this grant would offer support for local projects that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| create clear pathways to physically reconnect neighborhoods with public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6094)|

| 1:41:43| So this is an opportunity to promote economic investment in an area that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| been, has seen disinvestment in recent decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| It's also about increasing mobility and access to opportunity and to promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| active, healthy living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6114)|

| 1:41:58| I think several of you have asked this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| but I want to emphasize that the local match is all things that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| budgeted and planned for already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| And that, to me, is something we think about very strategically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| We don't just apply for grants because the grants are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| We apply for grants that complement the things and priorities that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| already seeking to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| I also am really pleased that the African American Equity Restoration Task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| Force has reviewed this and believes it's consistent with their priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| and has endorsed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| And their letter of support is part of the application submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| So any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6154)|

| 1:42:57| Yes, just briefly, back 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| that area that is now James A.G. Park was a parking lot in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| and this was a collaboration between the city and UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6185)|
| 1:43:12| And I was glad to see now that 20 years later that that lease agreement will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6197)|

| 1:43:22| That's Bill Lyons back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| And Ellen Adcock, who was a deputy mayor at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| always thought that she was kind of an unsung hero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| She was an essential link between the city and UT at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| So, Ellen, you're listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| I have no idea if you are, but 20 years later, I'm still thanking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6223)|

| 1:43:46| I just want to add one bit of thanks to Randall DeFord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| who's taken the baton and I think has done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| He and Wes have done a good job to take care of that treasure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| and I'm really grateful for UT and the city collaborating for another 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| years of a special place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| And while we're at it, I wanted to mention Carly Stribling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| who has done a tremendous job of landscaping that area on mainly a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6245)|
| 1:44:11| volunteer basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| Also, there's a lilac bush there that James Agee's daughter brought down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| from the northeast and planted in the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| because she said that was James Agee's favorite plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| and that he never could get it to grow in the northeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| but maybe it will grow down here, and it's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6274)|

| 1:48:04| How is that going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6484)|

| 1:48:08| This is a 15% decrease over our current rates, which is pretty exceptional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| And is that based on claims or do we have an explanation of why it's gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| It is based on our experience with our prior carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6503)|

| 1:48:28| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6508)|

| 1:48:50| Council members, there are two people signed up to speak in opposition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| Tyler Givens, you've signed up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| You can come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6540)|
| 1:49:11| My name is Tyler Givens, and I live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| I really appreciate the compromise about the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| That was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| But this big concrete plinth that's costing, what is it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| over 50% more than the original cost is really stupid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| and we shouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| We can sell that sculpture to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| We don't have to put it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| I mean, I don't particularly like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| It doesn't really have anything to do with country music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| We talked a lot about the problem with reducing porous surfaces in the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| You know, that was addressed a lot last time when people were here talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| This giant million-dollar concrete plank that's going to ruin this park is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6592)|
| 1:49:59| really not a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| The city has a lot of problems with cost estimation other than this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| You know, the public safety building has a cost overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| That's going to come up a little bit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| We're going to spend $5 million more on the brick siding there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| but I'll make sure to talk about that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| But you also had an overrun with the public safety building last year where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| approved an additional $20 million at the height of materials cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| which was a little bit silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| So it seems to me that even though there was an extensive planning process for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| this project, the city and the leadership it chose failed to account for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| will of the people as far as the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| failed to account for the need of the city environmentally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| really kind of failed to consider its own canopy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| failed to consider the nature of the park and what its meaning was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| The whole thing seems dumb and you don't have to go through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| You can stop it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| You can say let's stop throwing good money after bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| Let's not spend $1.3 million on a music park that looks nothing like music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| You can say let's do something with that money that's more useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| We obviously have a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| We have a homeless crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| We have lots of problems in our city where we could better spend this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| And if it seems like I'm rambling a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| that's fair because I didn't write any speeches tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| but I did sign up to talk to six agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| One of them was already passed on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| but I do intend to use all of my five minutes every time I come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| tonight, just primarily to waste your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| because it seems like that's the only thing you guys care about is whether you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| get out of here quickly or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| not whether you actually address the issues that are brought before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| council, not whether you really hear people as they speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| and engage in the political process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| not that you recognize groups of folk that come to support the veterinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| hospital they've been going to for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| There's just not a lot of listening from this side of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| And since you don't listen very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| I figure I might as well just say nonsense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| because you never listen to anything I say anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| So to get back on topic of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| again, it's a bad idea because the sculpture has nothing to do with music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| The cost overruns are egregious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| and the city doesn't really seem to want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| I mean, everybody was okay with the compromise of the trees being removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| but that wasn't even the only problem that was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| There was someone who spoke last time at length about how this project doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| really respect the history of the park or the history of country music and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| the plaques that were the central element of this park previously are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| just a side note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| just a thing that we're going to clean up and maybe put it back later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| It didn't have anything to do with the design of the sculpture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| It didn't have anything to do with the planning commission's plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| It was, again, an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| So I say scrap the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| Why spend this money at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| Why waste $800,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| Again, sell that sculpture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| Do something more meaningful with this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Spend half as much on something that's not a giant concrete slab in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| of a downtown that doesn't have any grass to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| except in very limited areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| Make the city better, not worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| And definitely don't spend $800,000 on a piece of concrete to make the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| worse, especially when they couldn't even plan the price to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| They couldn't plan around the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| They couldn't plan a reasonable price for this piece of concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| It just seems like the whole process has been a debacle start to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| And we had someone else come here tonight and say that they had issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| getting notifications from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| So I'm not surprised that people weren't aware that the trees were going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| removed until the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| I'm not surprised that people weren't aware of all the details in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| And I'm not surprised that the city wasn't paying enough attention to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| that it was going to cost over 50% more to finish this thing that you've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| planning for years now, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| So I'll end with just saying that, again, I'm disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| I'm disappointed in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| I'm disappointed that the concerns from citizens weren't taken more seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| I'm disappointed that y'all delayed the vote so that people had to come twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| and that, you know, really we have to come here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| I know Kent's going to speak in a minute, and he's going to be a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| eloquent than I am, but I've got 15 seconds left to waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| So I'm going to use them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| And I'll just say one more time, cost overruns for silly projects that do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| honor the city's history are not a good use of this council's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| The next person signed up to speak is Kent Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| Mr. Minow, if you could come to the podium and state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| Good evening, council members, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Yeah, I'm Kent Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| And, you know, all of us in the Sierra Club are really grateful at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6872)|
| 1:54:40| compromise that you all achieved last month to save the trees in the cradle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| of Country Music Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| It was a great moment when elected officialdom and citizens and city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| came together to do something really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| And as an environmentalist, I prefer to just go on to the next environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| disaster, galloping down on us and forget about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| But e-mails and texts have been coming in, and I want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| My comments are in a similar direction to Tyler's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| You know, coming down here tonight from Old North, I drive right through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6909)|
| 1:55:15| burgeoning homeless encampment, and I'm sure many of you do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| And it's a constant reminder, especially now that things are getting cold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| of money that we need to spend helping our most vulnerable citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| And tonight I'm going to read a comment from someone who can't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6929)|
| 1:55:35| Trudy Monaco was really instrumental in bringing a lot of citizen attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| to the problems around the cradle of Country Music Park and mobilizing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| come here and to send their comments to you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| She's had an accident, so please send her your good thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| and listen to her good words, better than I can put it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| Dear Mayor India Kincannon and council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| please do not release funds to install the concrete pad for the cradle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| Country Music Park sculpture at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| You have only received one bid at over $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| It is double what our engineering department estimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| We all know prices have increased, but not by 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| The funds may be available, but that's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| The point is that you are charged with spending our money responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| The vast majority of us, the citizens of Knoxville who are paying for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| project, get several bids before deciding on a contractor who will do work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| at our homes or businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| We expect you to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| Any money saved by not spending it unwisely can be used on public art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| projects in other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| Because there have been modifications to the original plans for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| project, it is only reasonable for the council to accept public feedback at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| this time and pause the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| Thank you for considering my thoughts on this issue respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| Trudy Monaco, founder, Candoro Arts and Heritage Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| Thank you for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| Councilmember, that concludes the people who have signed up to speak on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| Just for your information, Lisa Zenni from the Arts and Cultural Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| is available, and Andrew Bailey, the chair of the Public Arts Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| is available if you have any questions for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| Yeah, this is something that I've struggled with a lot about trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| balance out public process, subjective ideas about art and what's good for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7059)|
| 1:57:48| the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| Personally, you know, if I'd had my druthers, probably this piece of art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| would go on at Sutry Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| It's called your 865, River in the Backdrop, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7079)|
| 1:58:04| That would be my preference and my vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| However, art is a very subjective thing, and other people have different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7088)|
| 1:58:15| ideas about how our city could be enhanced with that that I may not agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| with and others may not agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| But kind of the bottom line for me on this allocation of money is we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| an arts council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| It did go through a public process, and it went through a long one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| And this is what they decided to do, and this is how they have decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| to allocate money that they've accumulated for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7121)|
| 1:58:49| And we do have review of that, but at the same time with a divergence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| of different opinions about what to do with the park, I think the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| line is we do have an arts council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| This is what they decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| So even though I might disagree with my possibly idiosyncratic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7146)|
| 1:59:14| sensibilities about what makes good art, I can't oppose the expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7154)|
| 1:59:21| of this funds in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| So I will be voting for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7174)|

| 1:59:38| 11-I as a resolution, authorize the Mayor to execute an agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| Knoxville's Community Development Corporation for Phase I infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| improvements at Western Heights in an amount not to exceed $4,200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7185)|
| 1:59:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Council Members, many of you were able to attend the celebration last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| week, or was that two weeks ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| This is the first installment of the city's $26.5 million that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| pledging to transform Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| It's an exciting step following the wonderful community celebration a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| few weeks ago, so thanks for everyone's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Yeah, I just wanted to, for everyone's benefit, Mr. Bentley, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| could comment on the schedule for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7221)|
| 2:00:26| This has been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| I remember back when I was on Neighborhood Advisory Council a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| back, there were lots of people in the neighboring community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| neighborhoods that wanted to see things happen on the site and housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| return there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| And I remember when you first came to Knoxville, you didn't think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| would happen as quickly as it's happening now for us, because I asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| It was one of the first things I asked you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| We're so lucky that this is now happening and funding is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| How soon might we expect to see residents be able to return to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| Yeah, Ben Bentley, 901 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| So, yeah, the reason it's happening so quickly is because of y'all's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| So, first and foremost, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| Councilman Smith's already asking me about Montgomery Village, so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| trying to temper expectations in some other parts of town here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| But for Western, we've really got a five- to six-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| We think that the first phase of new construction will close roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| last quarter of 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| Part of that is the slowdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| You know, the federal government's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| They're supporting our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| We're thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| It takes a long time to work through the details of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| We're also contingent on the state of Tennessee funding through the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| credit program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| So, realistically, September or October will be the phase that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| infrastructure is being approved for here, 120 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| But, as y'all know, the infrastructure on any of these projects has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| happen nine to 12 months before the actual project occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| So, that's why we're here requesting this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| And so, full build-out of the site, what is the anticipated time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| and how many units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| You hit me with hard questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| So, new units we're looking at, I'm doing the quick math in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| about 480 new units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| That's in addition to the 240 units that we're going to close on a rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| It's probably five and a half years from now, I suspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| when we get the entire site built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| We will try to expedite that, but there are only so many resources to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| And last question, how many units were there that got demoed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| I know that was before you got named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| So, prior to demo, there were 660 total units at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| So, 220 were demoed, roughly 2010-ish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| So, we're going to have a net gain overall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Council Member Ryder, just a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| It's a net gain, but also it's a different income mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| There will be super low income, moderately low income, and then some market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7374)|
| 2:03:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| Also, Mr. Bentley, could you explain to me and council for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| just remind us about the build first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| So, nobody's, just explain what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| So, we really like to maintain continuity in the neighborhood for families and residents that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| We are blessed with two vacant parcels of land in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| So, we'll build our first two phases on that vacant land and offer residents on site the opportunity to relocate on site with a single move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7405)|
| 2:03:34| We will also offer opportunities to utilize vouchers or to relocate to other properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| if that's what somebody chooses that's right for their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| But all in all, that on-site relocation is hugely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| Mr. Thomas, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| Just a short one, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| And it's just kind of underlined a little bit quickly what you said earlier about the groundbreaking on the project at Western Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7433)|
| 2:04:01| The Director of Housing and Urban Development was here, and I spoke with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7441)|
| 2:04:06| and this was a really competitive bid out of four cities, as we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7446)|
| 2:04:13| And I asked him, why did you choose Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| And he says, it was the representation that your city made to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| And I don't have any specific names because whoever's responsible for it is not hogging the limelight, I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7460)|
| 2:04:31| But I want to thank the administration and KCDC because that was really an accomplishment to be able to obtain that money for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7471)|
| 2:04:44| And it was justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| It was totally justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| But it also took a lot of acumen to thread that needle and get that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7489)|
| 2:04:55| So thank all of you that were involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7498)|
| 2:04:59| I'll just echo that and name some names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| I mean, KCDC's team, the team from CAC, our own Housing and Neighborhood Development staff, including Stephanie Welch and Becky Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7501)|
| 2:05:09| who are not with that staff anymore but will carry on without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| But we also had members from our Police Department and Public Service and Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7514)|
| 2:05:22| And I think also having the resident input multiple times and share their dreams was a big part of the positive outcome as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7522)|
| 2:05:31| So thank you for saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| I also want to add that I think we'd be remiss if we didn't say that collectively I think the Transforming Western video was very impactful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7537)|
| 2:05:46| for them to actually see the property and see the children and to hear from not just members of the city and KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7546)|
| 2:05:55| but also from residents and people that were just normal stakeholders who have been in this community for a very, very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7555)|
| 2:06:02| So it is amazing, and thank you for bringing that to our attention to call that out, Councilmember Thomas, that it was very competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7562)|
| 2:06:11| And I think that with all the efforts that were made, not just the paperwork but everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| that they really saw the heart and soul of our community and how great the need was and how much it would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| And thank you for pointing out the average citizen that voiced themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| And sometimes we forget how important input is at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7590)|
| 2:06:36| and they apparently, those neighbors represented their neighborhood very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| So that was an integral part of that, and thanks for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| Seeing no further comments, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7609)|

| 2:08:19| There's one person signed up to speak in opposition to this, Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7699)|
| 2:08:33| My name is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| I reside in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| I realize this seems like a strange item to oppose a small grant from a corporation to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7716)|
| 2:08:43| but it seems like an excellent opportunity to point out a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| So from the description on the agenda that was provided to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| one of the items this is supposed to address is KPD recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| So KPD is currently down 56 officers, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| Another aspect here is continued training of police officers, also mentioned here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| and also some improvements to Safety City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| So I thought this would be a good opportunity to talk about our police department's recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| and its issues and how this grant may or may not help with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| and also to talk a little bit about officer training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| and how this grant may or may not help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| Recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| I find it hard to believe that $5,000 is going to be very helpful for recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| in a department that is rife with racism and sexism, lack of accountability and corruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7767)|
| 2:09:34| First, tonight on consent, a pension was passed for Don Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| who was suspended in July for 10 days for basically participating in a cover-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| Mr. Givens, please spend your time on the specific agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| I had a statement prepared in case you said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| I would remind the mayor that decorum rules are not law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| and in this limited public forum created by the city, redress of grievances is well protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| and petty tyrants will not be tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| You do not have the right to curb my public speech due to its content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| only due to time, place and manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| And if you will please stop interrupting me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| I will not bring forward civil rights lawsuits against you for this kind of crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| So if you think I'm off topic, ask your officers to remove me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| Otherwise, please don't interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| Those of decorum do ask you to stick to the topic, so please endeavor to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| Don Jones could have been better trained with this Walmart grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| instead of promoting racism in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| Gosh, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| As far as training, so our officers already receive a lot of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| In fact, they receive 116 hours of emergency driving training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| Although the improvements to Safety City and this training may be necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| since in the past year we've had multiple instances of officers driving recklessly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| harming and injuring others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| Perhaps this training would have kept Cody Klingman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| from driving down Kingston Pike at 90 miles an hour with two of his compatriots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| and killing Mauricio Luna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| I actually got that dash cam footage recently and watched it very closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| and Mr. Klingman could have definitely used a lot more training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| Other than not using his lights in violation of General Order 1.8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| and the training he received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| he also could have stayed in his lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| If he had stayed in the right-hand lane coming around the turn on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| as perhaps he could have been trained by this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| then he would not have killed Mauricio Luna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| Likewise, Joseph Roberts probably could have used additional training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| before he assaulted Trinity Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| Matter of fact, that settlement was just taken care of earlier this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| one of the many civil rights lawsuits the city is facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| Perhaps additional training would have saved Anthony Thompson Jr.'s life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| instead of being shot to death by Officer Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| Gosh, India, you're leaning in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| The point is, this is a joke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| to pretend that recruitment and training can be fixed with this small amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| when we have a huge cultural problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| that is preventing us from recruiting and retaining high-quality officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| especially minority officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| Giving officers like Don Jones a full pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| and actually allowing him to continue with work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| I was really disappointed that was allowed to pass on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| since he is still employed and somehow getting a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| Hopefully this training will enable officers in our command structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7929)|
| 2:12:16| to better respect people's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| Perhaps this training could have also helped with the police officers in de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| I watched a video just today of an officer on July 28th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| choke-slamming a homeless man who was half his size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| when the homeless man offered no resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| As a matter of fact, I sent all of you council members that video today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| and I hope you'll take a look at it because it's pretty egregious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| This tiny grant is not going to fix anything in our police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7958)|
| 2:12:45| and we need to be serious about tackling the issues in our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| Reckless driving, reckless use of force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| disobeying policies, disobeying general orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| I don't think $5,000 is enough to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| As a matter of fact, I don't think any amount of money is enough to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| I think we need something more serious than just a little bit more training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| or a slightly improved safety city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| We need a massive overhaul of our police culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| and one so far that our new chief has not really stepped up to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| It's been very disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| Once again, I would say good for more training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| good for improvements to the safety city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| but it's not nearly enough to fix the serious problems that we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| with the violence, the racism, the corruption and recklessness in our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| Council, that concludes people's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| To speak on this item, any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| This item is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| necessary to apply for and if awarded except a grant in the amount of $30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| for the operation and maintenance of a joint city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| and Knox County Household Hazardous Waste Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| Council members, I just want to take this opportunity to recognize Mackenzie Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| Mackenzie, if you would raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| Mackenzie is the city's new Waste and Resources Manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| and she's been with the city six and a half years, starting as a coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| and has proven to be quite talented and quite a problem solver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| And when the manager, Patience Melnick, left the city to start her own business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| it was a great opportunity to promote her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| So we're really proud of growing our own talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| and really proud that she's taken on that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| If you all hear questions from constituents about waste issues, household trash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8084)|
| 2:14:49| please call on Mackenzie to help answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8089)|
| 2:14:55| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8101)|
| 2:15:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 2022-2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8104)|
| 2:15:12| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| Mr. Givens has signed up to speak in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| You may come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8120)|
| 2:15:30| Again, Tyler Givens, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| There are a lot of items included in this one-line description here of a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8132)|
| 2:15:41| So this is the amendment of the budget that includes the public safety complex project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8141)|
| 2:15:46| $5 million to cover the cost of replacing the brick siding on the new safety building that's being constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| in addition to the $20 million you already gave them again last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8151)|
| 2:15:56| Let's see, what else is in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| That's what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| KPD equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| Appropriate $770,000 for the purchase of new tasers and body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8162)|
| 2:16:07| It's unclear to me which is which in this $770,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| I'm a big fan of body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| I'm less a fan of tasers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| Officers have often used tasers in ways that are inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| Officers tend to draw their tasers a little more quickly than when they don't have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8181)|
| 2:16:26| but they could use opportunities to escalate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| Also, our police department doesn't seem to make good use of tasers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| because Officer Clabo sure did shoot his partner instead of using a taser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8191)|
| 2:16:39| Sorry, I lost my notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| Yeah, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| So I was wondering about that $5 million for the public safety complex project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| Given that the original cost overrun was another 40 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| and we had another 50-plus percent cost overrun tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| are we sure that it's going to be $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| or are we going to hear in a few months that it's $7.5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8217)|
| 2:17:02| Again, I should have prepared more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| I appreciate that we're addressing life safety and possible catastrophic concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| for these buildings that were renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| but I honestly question the need for this massive new public safety complex at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| I agree that the police department we have is a little bit dated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8239)|
| 2:17:23| but it seems to function just fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| and there could have been many other uses for this particular facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| So, again, we're just throwing more good money after poorly spent money, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8249)|
| 2:17:36| As far as the tasers, I was wondering if KPD had a particular lack of tasers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8256)|
| 2:17:43| I feel like I see most officers are pretty well equipped when I see them on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| Usually they have pepper spray and tasers and baton and weapon and bulletproof vest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| I was wondering if the officer that shot Philly Feep over a hit-and-run had a taser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| or if the officers, indeed, in Anthony's school had tasers on them at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8277)|
| 2:18:03| And if the case was that they didn't, then I would change my opinion and support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| because I would definitely rather they have less lethal means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| than the firearms that they are so apt to draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8290)|
| 2:18:20| Excuse me for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| I was wondering if lack of a taser was the reason that Sierra McCauley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| who was naked in the street, was shot by Officer James Gadd after 22 seconds of contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8312)|
| 2:18:40| or if maybe Jason Minnick was shot in his car in a parking lot because the officers didn't have tasers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8320)|
| 2:18:47| or if they think that the further deployment of tasers would have prevented the officer I saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8327)|
| 2:18:57| chokeslamming that homeless man from breaking KPD policy and the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| We keep throwing money at our police department as if it's going to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| And I won't repeat my entire last speech again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| but I think it's pretty obvious that tasers and body cameras, again, are not the issue with our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| An image of the new command staff was published earlier this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| and every single face on there was white, mostly men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| A few women had been moved into positions as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| but Susan Corker, who had been moved into an investigation command position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| was actually the one that investigated Joseph Roberts' assault on Trinity Clark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8373)|
| 2:19:37| where perhaps if he had had a taser, he wouldn't have had to beat her so hard and strip her top off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8377)|
| 2:19:43| But I just wonder if more body cameras and more tasers are going to fix a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| where the reviewing command staff has more problems with a swear word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| than they have with a brutal, violent assault, reckless driving, no lights and sirens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| almost hitting a bicyclist over a perceived slight from the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| Again, I'm just not sure that tasers and body cameras and more money for the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8407)|
| 2:20:14| who continue to break the rules we put before them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| continue to disobey the chief's directives to not threaten homeless people with felonies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| continue to ignore the city's change of use-of-force policy to disallow choke holds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| I just wonder if giving them more toys is the right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| Council, that concludes people signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| I have a question for somebody from the administration about at least one item in here specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8442)|
| 2:20:50| Hang on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| Let me find the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| On page 756, there's the transfer of a vacant zoning chief position to the Plans Review and Inspections Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8454)|
| 2:21:04| to the mayor's office as a special assistant position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| to support the creation of a new zoning department as part of the city's efforts to improve development services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8467)|
| 2:21:14| Could I get some elaboration on what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| I don't recall hearing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| Deputy Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder, for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| So we have a current position within Plans Review and Inspections that is a zoning chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8487)|
| 2:21:33| and that is vacant right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| As you know, there is a lot of focus and a strong desire by the city to make sure that we are using processes within zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8495)|
| 2:21:45| and planning that are efficient, that are streamlined, and that provide a good customer experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8505)|
| 2:21:51| One of the identified challenges is that there are currently, as I've described, two doors that applicants have to knock on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8511)|
| 2:21:58| depending on what they're asked or needing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| Sometimes they knock on the Plans Review and Inspections door and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| oh, we've got to go talk to planning, and they knock on the planning door and they get bounced back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| So our desire with creating a new planning department is to provide a one-stop shop for those in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8529)|
| 2:22:15| who are seeking to do a project that requires some zoning element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8535)|
| 2:22:19| There are currently staff within the Plans Review and Inspections department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8539)|
| 2:22:22| as well as separate staff under the planning department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| and our desire with the new zoning effort is to bring those staff together on a day-to-day basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8545)|
| 2:22:31| and this new zoning director position, even while we do not yet have a zoning department in terms of a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8551)|
| 2:22:40| it is a position that can provide day-to-day coordination to those staff across those two agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8560)|
| 2:22:46| to ensure that there's a more streamlined process for the customers who are engaging with us on various projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8566)|
| 2:22:52| requiring a zoning element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| When you say those two agencies, which two agencies are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8576)|
| 2:23:00| So the one would be the folks within our Plans Review and Inspections department under Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8580)|
| 2:23:06| and the second agency would be the staff within planning who work on zoning-related issues on a day-to-day basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8586)|
| 2:23:15| reacting and responding to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| At Knox Planning or within the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| No, at Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| At Knox when Knox is planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| Okay, so what would be within the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| The mayor's office is essentially a holding space for this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| until we would create an actual zoning department that would function by ordinance similar to our other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8610)|
| 2:23:36| We don't yet have that on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| and so by moving this position within the mayor's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| it allows us the opportunity to appoint that director position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8621)|
| 2:23:45| and allow them to begin working on assignment to supervise those staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| while we go through the process looking ahead to next budget year, future budget years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| as to when we would actually stand up on paper the zoning department from a budgetary perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8634)|
| 2:24:00| in terms of think about organ numbers and a variety of other things that have to happen to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8640)|
| 2:24:06| This gets us started down that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| and this person would become kind of the day-to-day supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| but also allow us to start working with them to determine what needs to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8652)|
| 2:24:16| to more specifically codify that within our code of ordinances that describes the different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8656)|
| 2:24:25| So we're going to have a zoning department in the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| and then we're still going to have Knox Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| and they're going to work in tandem or they're going to be two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8670)|
| 2:24:36| So I think there's a couple different components to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| We are specifically talking with this zoning element,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8680)|
| 2:24:45| those functions that planning staff perform that are, again, I use the term reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8685)|
| 2:24:50| They are things that people have an application, they have to do addressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8690)|
| 2:24:54| plot reviews, you know, a variety of other functions that respond to a particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8694)|
| 2:25:00| that is separate from things like long-range planning and sector planning that are more proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8700)|
| 2:25:06| So specifically, yes, we envision this zoning department would encompass all of the functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8706)|
| 2:25:12| that are currently done by planning staff that relate to that reactive role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8712)|
| 2:25:18| Again, we are quite a bit from that being a full department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| so at this time it really is a position who can oversee and supervise on a day-to-day basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8723)|
| 2:25:28| the existing staff that are already doing those functions so that there's a very seamless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8728)|
| 2:25:34| you know, as we've described it, the machine continues to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8734)|
| 2:25:37| There's no gap in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| Let me interrupt real quick because my five minutes is being taken up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| but other people answer my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| When you guys came to dinner with council a month ago, was that a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8744)|
| 2:25:50| when we talked about what's coming down the pike, is this something I missed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| I don't remember talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8758)|
| 2:25:59| So I think we've been talking about how we improve development services for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| and so this is a mix of a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| Number one, Peter Ahrens already serves as the chief building official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| He makes zoning interpretations every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| They've been exceedingly busy, and so there are zoning decisions from a kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8773)|
| 2:26:19| I'll call it a machine, blue collar, getting permits through on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| That goes through Peter and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8782)|
| 2:26:26| There's functions that also go through planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| So we pay planning to provide those services through a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| and so this is part of a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| One, part of trying to provide some relief and make sure that that zoning function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| that Peter does has adequate resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| We would also like to bring kind of a planner perspective into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| Peter is aware of that, and so that's one piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8804)|
| 2:26:48| So it's really part of that making development more predictable and easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| We're, again, how do we align the resources we already pay for through planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| in a way that there's more seamless interaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| So that is part of the idea of creating someone who wakes up every day to think of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| and those technical functions that we pay for at planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| bring those two together so that, again, instead of two doors, there's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| It could still be planning staff, but there are contractors providing those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8831)|
| 2:27:16| So that is part of that making development easier process we've been discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8836)|
| 2:27:22| Council, I'll just add that, you know, when I hired Amy Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| and brought her over from planning, this was something that we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| that she would be director of housing and neighborhood development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| but also help us as a city tap into the efficiencies and streamlining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8854)|
| 2:27:41| and the talents of the planning staff in a way that maybe we haven't been fully utilizing before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8861)|
| 2:27:47| This is something also that Mayor Jacobs and I discussed when we appointed Jeff Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| who's here as a director of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| So there's two different, you know, planning serves the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8875)|
| 2:28:00| and a lot of times, you know, having them do very different zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8880)|
| 2:28:06| for those two different entities can be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8886)|
| 2:28:11| So this way, eventually, you know, maybe over time, we're not ready to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8891)|
| 2:28:17| we don't have a fully fleshed out plan yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| but this is some way to, like we've been saying all along, have more one-stop shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8899)|
| 2:28:24| so people who are coming for development services and to invest in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| can get their plans, reviews, and inspection done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| and their planning and zoning issues all done in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| So this is step one to sort of realizing some of those efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| I'll let my other colleagues ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| I think Ms. Fugate was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| This is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8929)|
| 2:28:50| So my question would be, I mean, you have the right to set up your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8930)|
| 2:28:57| however you want to set up your staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| but what I'm hearing sounds to me like we're eventually going to do within, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8940)|
| 2:29:08| do within the city what we're having planning do for us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8948)|
| 2:29:13| So do we eventually, I mean, I know that's kind of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8953)|
| 2:29:19| I hope this is more clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| Right now I have less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8961)|
| 2:29:24| Yeah, well, this is a work in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| and this is something I've asked Amy Brooks to work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| and unfortunately she had a family commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| She couldn't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| We all want more clarity on these potential changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| but also our development community wants more clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8979)|
| 2:29:42| and that's the goal of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| So nothing will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| It's more of a co-locating of planning staff and plans, reviews, and inspection staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| But, again, this budget amendment is just one little change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| It's not any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| This person will just work for whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9000)|
| 2:30:04| Under Economic Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9004)|
| 2:30:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| So they'll report to Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9009)|
| 2:30:10| So just really quickly, right now in Peter's shop there's a director, Peter Aarons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9010)|
| 2:30:16| chief building official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9016)|
| 2:30:17| There's a deputy director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| Then there are divisions, and one of the divisions is zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9019)|
| 2:30:22| and there's a zoning chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9022)|
| 2:30:23| That's been unfilled for a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| It's been hard to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| Then there are two zoning plans review people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9027)|
| 2:30:30| So plans come in, zoning chief or Peter right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| and Brian are handling that function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| Some of the demands and some of what we've heard from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| and Councilman Smith is, hey, our zoning is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9039)|
