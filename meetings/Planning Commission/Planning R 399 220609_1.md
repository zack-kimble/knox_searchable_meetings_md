| 2:30:54| to talk about the policy that's being sought here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| and then I'm here to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| about the legalities of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| So if you'll permit me, I think that might be a better way to approach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9061)|
| 2:31:08| Yeah, I'll start just a little bit, just kind of from an origin perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9068)|
| 2:31:13| One of the things, obviously, my department does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| is oversee the downstream effects of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| And we're always looking for ways to streamline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| and provide better service to the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| And in doing so, we had noticed that over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| there's been a tremendous amount of increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| in use on review appeals going to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| whereas historically, BZA is more of an administrative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| dealing with setbacks and minor zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| So I had brought that to the mayor's office attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9105)|
| 2:31:50| and that's kind of what started this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9110)|
| 2:31:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| So that's what came to our office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| We were asked to draft something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9121)|
| 2:32:02| that would address the jurisdiction of the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9122)|
| 2:32:08| I did a memo on this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| I trust everybody's gotten a copy of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| and hopefully had an opportunity to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| BZA is a creature that is created by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| Any county that wishes to have zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| has to have a board of zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| And that board of zoning appeals has certain powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| that are set forth in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| Those powers are to hear and decide appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| where it is alleged by the appellant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| that there's an error in any order, requirement, decision, or refusal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| made by the county building commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9160)|
| 2:32:43| or any other administrative official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| in carrying out of the enforcement of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| in active pursuit of this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| Two, the power to hear or decide in accordance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| with the provisions of such ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9175)|
| 2:32:56| requests for special exemptions or interpretations of the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| or for decisions upon other special questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| upon which the board is authorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| by such ordinance to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| And three, whereby reason of exceptional narrowness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9190)|
| 2:33:13| at the time of the enactment of the regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| or other extraordinary, exceptional situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9198)|
| 2:33:20| or conditions, the strict application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| of any regulation enacted under these sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9202)|
| 2:33:24| would result in particular hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| I won't read the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| That's variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9208)|
| 2:33:28| We all know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9208)|
| 2:33:29| OK, those are the three powers that a board of zoning appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| has to have under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| Now, the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| as I have said in other contexts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| at this point has more evolved than been created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9221)|
| 2:33:45| over the years, has a couple of provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| that go beyond what that statute talks about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| And where we find that is in section 6.60.03| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9233)|
| 2:33:57| of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| In the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| it reflects those powers that are set forth in the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9241)|
| 2:34:05| but it goes on to add section C, to hear and decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9245)|
| 2:34:09| in accordance with the provisions of Article 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| supplementary regulations, section 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| development standards for uses permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| and Article 6, administration enforcement and interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| section 6.50, procedures for authorizing uses permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| on review of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| appeals from the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| decisions regarding uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| So this is a section that has been added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9271)|
| 2:34:34| that is not one of the powers that is specifically provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9274)|
| 2:34:38| to the BZA under the enabling statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| What this ordinance would do is to address that 6.60.03C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9282)|
| 2:34:48| It would also look at 6.50.07, which also would appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9288)|
| 2:34:55| to give the Board of Zoning Appeals an appellate view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9295)|
| 2:35:01| of uses on review that come from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9301)|
| 2:35:05| Now, let me step back and say that as I've pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9305)|
| 2:35:12| in my memo, the term use on review over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9312)|
| 2:35:17| has been used in a fairly sloppy fashion by almost everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9317)|
| 2:35:24| When you read the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| there are really two things, two different categories of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9327)|
| 2:35:31| that this body will be called upon from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| to look at regarding the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9335)|
| 2:35:39| One of those things is uses on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| and you'll find those in almost every zone we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9340)|
| 2:35:44| So if I turn to CA, just at random,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| 5.31 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| CA, general business zone, under 5.31.02,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| you'll see, you know, 20 or 30 uses that are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9356)|
| 2:36:04| And by uses permitted, what it means is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| if you meet all the other regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| you don't need any other permission from anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| to do what it is you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| But when we get down to 5.31.03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9373)|
| 2:36:16| we see uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| These are things like self-service storage facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9378)|
| 2:36:21| child daycare centers, marinas and boat liveries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| just to read some off in the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9384)|
| 2:36:27| That is a use on review, and those are the kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| that will come to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| But complicating the matter is the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| that we also have zones, and I've used the PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| in my memo, if I could find it real quick, as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9400)|
| 2:36:46| I'll just do it from memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| The PR zone, like all these other zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| has uses that are of right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9410)|
| 2:36:53| Uses permitted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9413)|
| 2:36:55| So if you meet the regulations of the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| those are a list of uses you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| without any further permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| There also in the PR zone are uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9423)|
| 2:37:07| From memory, they include things like adult daycare centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| and things like that, that if you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9430)|
| 2:37:15| you must come to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| and get permission as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9437)|
| 2:37:21| But also in the PR zone, and certain other zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| PC I think, SC, any use that you want has to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9443)|
| 2:37:31| by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| But when you read the language carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| that part is called a development plan, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| So if I'm in the PR zone and I want to put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9462)|
| 2:37:46| let's say a subdivision, then not only must I go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9466)|
| 2:37:50| through the subdivision review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| through the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| but I almost also must get the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9474)|
| 2:37:58| to approve my development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9478)|
| 2:38:02| Now the development plan is not a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9482)|
| 2:38:08| They're different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| But when you look at the authority that's given the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| of zoning appeals, which as I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9493)|
| 2:38:15| is beyond what is mandated by statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| it speaks in terms of use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9499)|
| 2:38:22| but not development plans, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9502)|
| 2:38:25| So I have argued in my memo that to a certain extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9505)|
| 2:38:29| and to the extent that the thing that we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| to avoid is having the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9512)|
| 2:38:33| of zoning appeals re-litigate subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9513)|
| 2:38:37| that have been appealed to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9517)|
| 2:38:41| And this body has considered with the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9521)|
| 2:38:44| of a full-time professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| that can advise them on these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| We may not even need to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9530)|
| 2:38:53| This ordinance would completely strip boards of zoning appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9533)|
| 2:38:59| from looking at any use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| But I would like to just point out that uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| on review are governed by, I think it's Article 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| Section 2, it's the section that talks about the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| for uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9554)|
| 2:39:15| It's those things that the BZA is looking at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| And I'm not sure how many of those are actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| Finally, there's one last section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| of the proposed ordinance that the body should be aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9564)|
| 2:39:28| of in considering what if any recommendations they wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9568)|
| 2:39:32| to make to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| And that's the one that speaks to Section 6.40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| of the Knox County Zoning Code that deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| with county commission review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| There is a section in the code, 6.401.02 and .03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9583)|
| 2:39:48| that deals with, I'll just go ahead and say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| any person, firm, or corporation agreed by any decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| that would not normally be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| by the county commission may petition the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| for review, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| This section would seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| to give the county commission the authority to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| as an appellate body over the decisions of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| Now, in 1990, there was a case called Browning-Ferris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9612)|
| 2:40:17| Industries versus Knox County Board of Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| where the board of commissioners heard a use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9619)|
| 2:40:23| on review appeal from a landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9623)|
| 2:40:26| And they turned it down, as the commission was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| at the time wont to do, and BFI sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9629)|
| 2:40:33| And the Supreme Court of Tennessee said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| that the county commission did not have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| to arrogate to itself appellate review over the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9637)|
| 2:40:42| Now, the little fly in the ointment, so if we base it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9642)|
| 2:40:46| on that, this section is unconstitutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| it's no question, but it was decided at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| when the charter was just going into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| So there is an argument to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9652)|
| 2:40:55| that with home rule authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9655)|
| 2:40:56| perhaps the county commission could arrogate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9656)|
| 2:40:58| to itself that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9658)|
| 2:41:01| So as part of the whole review of this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| it was decided that it would probably be a good idea just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| to repeal that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| I don't think the county commission has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| nor really wants to hear these kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| of appeals going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| So those are the two sections, or the two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| that this ordinance attempts to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| If I haven't completely confused you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| I'm open to take any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9684)|
| 2:41:29| Any questions for Mr. Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| Seeing none, I will ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| I would agree with you that in the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9695)|
| 2:41:40| it mentions that development plans should be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9700)|
| 2:41:45| in the same aspect as use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9705)|
| 2:41:48| and that it is essentially a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| and that the Board of Zoning Appeals does not have authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9711)|
| 2:41:53| under TCA to review in any way a subdivision process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9713)|
| 2:42:01| So I would agree there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| I think that is generally what we're getting to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| What's the problem is that we're getting subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| coming in under the PR zone, and rather than going to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| they're dragging it out and taking it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| into the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| So I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| And I also agree with the aspect of it should not be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9741)|
| 2:42:24| before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| I agree with that 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| I do have an issue with not allowing other uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9748)|
| 2:42:35| to not be heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| And I think in TCA 137109, as you stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9758)|
| 2:42:43| you know, a special exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| And special exceptions are used intermittently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| between use on review and special exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| It's a very common terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| So I think that TCA is specific in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9773)|
| 2:42:59| those are rights granted by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| If you're going to have zoning and you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| this Board of Zoning Appeals, these are certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9785)|
| 2:43:08| that the board has the right to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| And the public has a right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9792)|
| 2:43:15| So, I mean, I think we can get to where we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9795)|
| 2:43:19| without basically throwing the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9799)|
| 2:43:23| I think we can fix the PR district and eliminate the phrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9803)|
| 2:43:28| that mentions use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| And that would solve, I think, most of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| that we're having with appeals coming before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| That's my strictly opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| And I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| Mr. Chairman, let me make my position here clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9822)|
| 2:43:46| I'm not advocating for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| I'm just here to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9828)|
| 2:43:51| An alternative way to do what you're suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| would be to just more carefully define the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| between development plans and use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9838)|
| 2:44:01| I think the code is not sufficiently clear on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9841)|
| 2:44:04| And I think over the years, the usage that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9844)|
| 2:44:08| have entered into has not been sufficiently clear either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| So that would be another way to skin that cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| Yeah, I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9854)|
| 2:44:19| We do have some people willing to speak in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9859)|
| 2:44:23| Can I speak real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| Andrew Davis from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| I just want to say the mayor would be amenable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| to a friendly amendment to that effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| if that's what you all wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| Our concern is with the PR zone, not with uses on reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| defined by Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| So we're more than open to an amendment to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| That's kind of what I've felt all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| We're kind of getting a little deeper into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| than we probably need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9884)|
| 2:44:49| Mr. Moyers, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| And we do have some individuals, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| that are wanting to speak, some of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| So if you want to come up here and give us your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| and address, and we have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| Wayne Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| I saw Mr. Klein leave up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| He's back in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9909)|
| 2:45:10| Mr. Klein, you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9910)|
| 2:45:13| Ms. Korbelick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| Ms. Close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| And Mr. Silverstein?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9917)|
| 2:45:22| Let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9922)|
| 2:45:33| Mr. Klein's going to speak after us on the legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9933)|
| 2:45:38| Let's not drag this out all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| But let's get to the point, Mr. Silverstein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| and I'll give you three minutes, and I'll give three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| to the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| So if you could go ahead and state your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| You name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9953)|
| 2:45:57| I'm speaking on behalf of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9957)|
| 2:46:01| We oppose the proposed zoning ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| and ask that you vote no or, in the alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9963)|

| 2:46:10| Amending the zoning ordinance should be done only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9970)|
| 2:46:13| if there is a strong rationale for ending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| a longstanding practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| For many reasons, planning commission decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9977)|
| 2:46:21| on use on review should remain appealable to the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9981)|
| 2:46:25| rather than go directly to Chancery Court as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| Removing BZA from the appeals process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| denies the public taxpayers and citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| the opportunity to participate in the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| of their government and an efficient review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| of important planning commission decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| An appeal to Chancery Court is much more costly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| than an appeal to BZA, making such an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10005)|
| 2:46:48| simply unaffordable to citizens and neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| and thus, in effect, would end citizens' right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| This would be an unnecessary and poor policy choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| and sends a terrible message to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| An appeal to BZA takes much less time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| than an appeal to Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| Less time spent is good for both the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10028)|
| 2:47:11| and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| BZA operates with broader authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| to reweigh the factual evidence and arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10036)|
| 2:47:19| whereas the Chancery Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| has a very limited scope of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| There have been only 16 appeals filed in the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10043)|
| 2:47:28| 70% of those appeals were resolved at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| These appeals are not an overload to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| If the amendment is to be considered at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10056)|
| 2:47:38| it should be part of the advanced NOx process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| We reject the idea that a zoning ordinance-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10061)|
| 2:47:44| use-on-review development plan is in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| comparable to a subdivision concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| The use-on-review development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| is, in fact, the defining characteristic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| of the planned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10076)|
| 2:47:58| So we ask that you please deny the proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| to the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10081)|
| 2:48:02| and we thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| Ms. Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10086)|
| 2:48:13| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| Thank you for this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| Sandra Korbelick, 5212 Daphne Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10097)|
| 2:48:22| I have worked in planning for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| I'm AICP credentialed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| and I've been a planning commissioner twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| Last time was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| This whole issue before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10111)|
| 2:48:32| I think has gotten unnecessarily complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| The question on what is a use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| what is a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| what is a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| what powers does BCA actually have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10124)|
| 2:48:47| according to the state statute and our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| Most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| and here's where I do take exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| to some of the thinking of the planning commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10134)|
| 2:48:57| I do not feel that the current system is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10137)|
| 2:49:01| I feel that there is not an existing problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10141)|
| 2:49:05| and that we need not be in a hurry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| to fix anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10147)|
| 2:49:10| The question before you in moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| one is what are the unintended consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| PR is not the only development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10158)|
| 2:49:21| Shopping center zone also requires development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10161)|
| 2:49:28| The county commission question before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| if you look at the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| it's really pretty straight up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| It basically says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10174)|
| 2:49:36| should BCA stop hearing use-on-review appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| We know that PR is the big part of that caseload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10179)|
| 2:49:43| So basically they're asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| should PR be appealed to the BCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| There are some really good reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| to maintain the BCA appeal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10191)|
| 2:49:54| which haven't really been touched on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| by the county speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| BCA has an excellent track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| 70% of the cases before them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| have been handled by the BCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| without having to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| The BCA process is quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| a matter of a month or two rather than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10213)|
| 2:50:16| It's inexpensive and it's flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| Court can only affirm or deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10220)|
| 2:50:23| based on arbitrary or capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10223)|
| 2:50:26| The BCA is able to modify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10226)|
| 2:50:29| several of the cases that come before them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10229)|
| 2:50:32| to the acceptance of both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10232)|
| 2:50:35| It is not necessarily an adversarial position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10235)|
| 2:50:39| It's a compromise position handled at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10239)|
| 2:50:46| The time to really discuss what a PR is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10246)|
| 2:50:50| is when we go into the rewrite of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| Then we can decide what the correct appeal process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10253)|
| 2:50:57| We all pretty much know that the PR code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10257)|
| 2:51:00| is very ambiguous and open to wide interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| Why would we want to hurry up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| and expedite a flawed process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10266)|
| 2:51:09| By that, I mean the PR is basically flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10269)|
| 2:51:13| What we're going to hurry up and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| is to expedite through the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10275)|
| 2:51:18| a code that we are not happy with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| and feel that has a lot of improvement to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| Basically, the simple policy question before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10285)|
| 2:51:29| is do you want a local body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| to receive planned residential appeals or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| The Town Hall East Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| of which I'm the past president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| submitted a letter supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10301)|
| 2:51:43| the existing BZA appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10303)|
| 2:51:46| Town Hall East boundary, almost half of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10306)|
| 2:51:49| is shared by the county unincorporated land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10309)|
| 2:51:53| I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10313)|
| 2:51:55| I present to you that this is a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10315)|
| 2:51:57| as well as a county issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| If you choose to examine this in detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10320)|
| 2:52:05| which I don't think you need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| then perhaps we can talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| what your process is going to be for deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| There are a number of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10332)|
| 2:52:14| that the staff should be able to research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| and bring back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10336)|
| 2:52:18| Too complex to make a hasty decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| Let's make sure that we're deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10341)|
| 2:52:23| Please wrap up your comments, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10343)|
| 2:52:24| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10344)|
| 2:52:25| I'm all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10345)|
| 2:52:27| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10347)|

| 2:52:45| and make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10365)|

| 2:53:14| which is a court of appeals case in 1981,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10394)|
| 2:53:18| stated that a party aggrieved by an MPC decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10398)|
| 2:53:21| to approve use permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| under the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10403)|
| 2:53:25| may appeal to the Board of Adjustment and Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| That's the equivalent of the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| So state law, it is our position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| requires Knox County to establish a BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| with enumerated powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| and this includes decisions about uses permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10420)|
| 2:53:44| and decisions about development plans in a PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10424)|
| 2:53:47| With all due respect, your chair has it correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10427)|
| 2:53:51| What you need to do is not violate the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10431)|
| 2:53:55| Go take a look at the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| rewrite it, and you'll have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10437)|
| 2:53:59| With that, we respectfully agree with you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| Thank you, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| Thank you for coming under your time allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10445)|
| 2:54:09| All right, that concludes any public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| Chair will recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10452)|
| 2:54:16| So going through all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10456)|
| 2:54:19| when the chair made his recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| I was watching the mayor's office came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| and said that they were amenable to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| and I also noticed that certain members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| from the KCPA were nodding in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| So let's come up with some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10471)|
| 2:54:34| to send back to County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| with all three of those people in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| on what that language needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10479)|
| 2:54:40| The one thing that I also think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| going back to some other days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| I think we need to put some very clear definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| at the front end so that there's no confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| as to what's meant of what they're going to read later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10489)|
| 2:54:54| So I think we need to include some definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| to clean that up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10496)|
| 2:54:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10497)|
| 2:55:00| Is there a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10500)|
| 2:55:03| Yeah, just so that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| So are we going to remove the references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10505)|
| 2:55:09| to a use on review associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10509)|
| 2:55:10| through the PR zone for subdivisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| That's the 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10512)|
| 2:55:13| That's mostly what we're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10516)|
| 2:55:16| That's what we're seeking to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10516)|
| 2:55:19| Our only fear is there's so much ambiguity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10519)|
| 2:55:22| around what a use on review is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| Different attorneys have different opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10524)|
| 2:55:27| which is why we didn't amend it before we brought it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| But the mayor's intent is to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10530)|
| 2:55:34| those PR concept plans out of BCA, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10534)|
| 2:55:37| And we would support anything that achieves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| We're not really concerned with use on reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| as defined by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| So I would agree with that and support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10543)|
| 2:55:47| How do we accomplish that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10547)|
| 2:55:48| Can we direct someone here through this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10548)|
| 2:55:51| to make those changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| Yeah, well, we've got a number of people that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| But my suggestion is that we postpone a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10555)|
| 2:55:59| and have the law department come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| in with a revised ordinance that basically gets to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10561)|
| 2:56:07| we recently talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10567)|
| 2:56:10| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10570)|
| 2:56:11| So anyway, Commissioner Roth, and we'll get to Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10571)|
| 2:56:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10574)|
| 2:56:14| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10574)|
| 2:56:15| That was basically what I was trying to get at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10575)|
| 2:56:20| is how do we do that today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| How do we change the language in that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| And our esteemed attorney over there might tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| If I can figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| Is that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10589)|
| 2:56:34| OK, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10594)|
| 2:56:35| So there is some guidance for us in Tennessee law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10595)|
| 2:56:38| for the questions that you all are posing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| Tennessee Code Annotated Section 13-7-105 relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10600)|
| 2:56:45| to amendments of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| Relates to amendments of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| The county legislative body may, from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10610)|
| 2:56:53| so this is what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10613)|
| 2:56:54| is the county commission, the county legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| from time to time may amend the number, shape, boundary, area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10616)|
| 2:57:01| or any regulation of or within any district or districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10621)|
| 2:57:05| or any other provision of any zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| So it's very broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10629)|
| 2:57:10| So this is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10630)|
| 2:57:11| It's something that would be captured by this provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| And then here's the part that is applicable now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| But any such amendment shall not be made or become effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10638)|
| 2:57:22| unless the same be first submitted for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10642)|
| 2:57:25| disapproval, or suggestions to the regional planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| commission of the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10649)|
| 2:57:31| So that's where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| So from an interpretation of state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| your choices are you can approve, you can disapprove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10655)|
| 2:57:39| or you can make suggestions based on the deliberation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| and conversations that you're having today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| which sounds like that's what you intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| So my interpretation of state law, and of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10666)|
| 2:57:49| I'm happy to hear from the county law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10669)|
| 2:57:50| if he is in agreement or disagreement with this advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| my advice would be that it would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| to put suggestions from the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10676)|
| 2:58:00| into writing for consideration of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10680)|
| 2:58:04| as they move forward with this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| And it sounds like there's a framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10686)|
| 2:58:07| to work from for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10687)|
| 2:58:08| So we could make a motion to send it back to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10688)|
| 2:58:12| with the suggestions that we're talking about now today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10692)|
| 2:58:16| Well, it looks like from state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10696)|
| 2:58:18| the onus is on us at this stage to prepare that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10698)|
| 2:58:21| Now, of course, the county may agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10701)|
| 2:58:24| that they're willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10704)|
| 2:58:24| And I see that Mr. Morris is ready to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10704)|
| 2:58:27| So I'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10707)|
| 2:58:28| What I would say to you is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10708)|
| 2:58:29| The ordinance that was included in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| was an ordinance that was drafted, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| by me in response to what I understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10714)|
| 2:58:37| the mayor's request was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| It has not been acted on by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| It is just a suggestion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| If this body were to pass a motion saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10724)|
| 2:58:49| this is what we would recommend, we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10729)|
| 2:58:54| have to draft the ordinance for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| So if you can make it plain what your recommendation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10736)|
| 2:59:00| I'm happy to draft an ordinance that reflects that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| And we will submit that to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10746)|
| 2:59:06| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10746)|
| 2:59:07| So on that, can we go like, item number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10747)|
| 2:59:10| that we want suggestions so we can write that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10750)|
| 2:59:13| to send to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10753)|
| 2:59:14| Item number two, all those suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10754)|
| 2:59:16| that we all agree on, then vote on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10756)|
| 2:59:19| to send to the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| Is that what I'm understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| That we can do by making suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| You can make suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10766)|
| 2:59:27| In the form of a motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10767)|
| 2:59:28| You can make suggestions that would then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| be presented as a result of it would be a motion made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10770)|
| 2:59:34| by this body and approved by the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| that suggestions have been made consistent with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10776)|
| 2:59:39| and, frankly, the request of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| that this body participate in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10781)|
| 2:59:45| Personally, I would be hesitant to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10785)|
| 2:59:49| recommending something tonight in black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10789)|
| 2:59:53| I'd prefer that staff work with the law department mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10793)|
| 2:59:58| office to come up with a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10798)|
| 3:00:01| that we can review at the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10801)|
| 3:00:04| One month is not going to ruin the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10804)|
| 3:00:08| And we can get this thing rectified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| Personally, I'd like to see the PR district be totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10810)|
| 3:00:13| rewritten because there's so much ambiguity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10813)|
| 3:00:18| that it's difficult for us as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10818)|
| 3:00:20| to really view it correctly and fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10820)|
| 3:00:24| But that might be a bigger challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10824)|
| 3:00:27| than what we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| That's what I wanted to ask, that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10833)|
| 3:00:36| are in discussion right now and trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10836)|
| 3:00:39| to hear from all of our members about what we think may work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10839)|
| 3:00:44| I'm hearing three different issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| but all of them seem to go back to an issue with the PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10848)|
| 3:00:51| Why might we not elevate that to the top concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10851)|
| 3:00:57| and let that be part of the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| that that be addressed first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10859)|
| 3:01:04| Well, I think that's what we're trying to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10864)|
| 3:01:06| I think that's what the county's trying to do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10866)|
| 3:01:11| I'm hearing things about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10871)|
| 3:01:12| Yeah, I think it's moved one step beyond just the PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10872)|
| 3:01:17| It's gone into all use one reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| Is that correct, Mr. Moyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| The way the ordinance is currently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10881)|
| 3:01:24| that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10884)|
| 3:01:25| However, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10885)|
| 3:01:28| That was the original mandate that, as I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10888)|
| 3:01:32| since that time, I have come to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| that what the mayor's office's real concern was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10896)|
| 3:01:40| is submitting subdivision concept plans to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10900)|
| 3:01:48| And so if we, and what I've heard the mayor's office saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10908)|
| 3:01:54| and what they've said to you today is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10914)|
| 3:01:56| if we limit the scope of what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10916)|
| 3:01:59| doing to just that and leave all other uses on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10919)|
| 3:02:05| like landfills and utility plants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| and all the rest of that, to BZA review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| that accomplishes the mayor's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| I'm happy to rewrite the ordinance in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10934)|
| 3:02:17| that it accomplishes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| And I think that that leaves use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10939)|
| 3:02:24| as that term is properly understood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10944)|
| 3:02:27| appellate authority with the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10947)|
| 3:02:30| while maintaining that development plans that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10950)|
| 3:02:34| are submitted to the Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10954)|
| 3:02:37| Commission would themselves not be within the BZA's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10957)|
| 3:02:41| Which, frankly, I think is what the zoning code says now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10961)|
| 3:02:44| just not in the most clear and concise fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10964)|
| 3:02:49| So could we not put in a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10969)|
| 3:02:51| were requesting the county law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| to remove all references from the PR zone of use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| and insert development plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10976)|
| 3:02:59| Does that accomplish what you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10979)|
| 3:03:01| Let me say this about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10981)|
| 3:03:03| I know what you're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10983)|
| 3:03:06| I would point out that within the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| as I've mentioned before, there are uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| that are permitted as of right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| And there are uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10993)|
| 3:03:17| Group daycare homes, assisted living facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| adult daycare centers, rural retreats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| and public safety facilities are all uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11002)|
| 3:03:24| on review within the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11004)|
| 3:03:27| Now, if we simply say that development plan means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11007)|
| 3:03:32| development plan, that it's something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11012)|
| 3:03:35| which I think when you look at section 6.13.15 of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11015)|
| 3:03:40| it says, no building permit shall be issued for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11020)|
| 3:03:42| of any property within a PR plan residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11022)|
| 3:03:45| until a written application for review and approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11025)|
| 3:03:47| of the development plan has been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11027)|
| 3:03:51| I think that's where we've been getting hung up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11031)|
| 3:03:54| because people are taking development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| and they're conflating it in their minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| with use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| I think the zoning code properly understood already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11041)|
| 3:04:05| does not give BZA that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11045)|
| 3:04:08| Some language that might make that clearer could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11048)|
| 3:04:10| But if we remove all reference to use on review from PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| then we leave out these uses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11054)|
| 3:04:15| are actually permitted on review under the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11055)|
| 3:04:18| So we've got to find a way to thread that needle, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11058)|
| 3:04:23| Be my suggestion, go forth and make those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11063)|
| 3:04:26| and bring it back to us in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11066)|
| 3:04:28| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| Any comments from commission on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11070)|
| 3:04:34| Pat, I think what I'm hearing in my simple mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11074)|
| 3:04:39| is there's a difference between a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11079)|
| 3:04:44| and a development plan and concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| And that's simply what we need to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| And then it solves the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11089)|
| 3:04:52| I think that some language that makes it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11092)|
| 3:04:57| that there's a difference between development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| and a use on review could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| I'd have to think about how to structure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11102)|
| 3:05:06| But I think that, as I've said in the memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11106)|
| 3:05:10| if you had an opportunity to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| I think that the evil that's attempting to be cured here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11112)|
| 3:05:16| probably doesn't exist when the code is properly interpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11116)|
| 3:05:22| Cut you off, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11122)|
| 3:05:24| But again, the only reason that we brought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| was to provide kind of legislative clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11126)|
| 3:05:29| so that there's not a lawsuit down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| deciding where do these things need to be properly heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11131)|
| 3:05:34| If you all amended the motion just to make it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11134)|
| 3:05:38| that your intent is not to move use on reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| and only to move the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11141)|
| 3:05:44| we could draft the ordinance next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| and have it reflect that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| So we're open to whatever you decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| One thing I would add, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11152)|
| 3:05:55| because this is a second and related but different problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| is the section dealing with section 6.40.012 and 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11160)|
| 3:06:05| providing county commission review of these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| I do think that it would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11167)|
| 3:06:12| if this body were to keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11172)|
| 3:06:14| Because if we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| then we have potentially two different routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11176)|
| 3:06:20| that MPC decisions could be appealed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| One of them, which I think there's a very strong argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| and that would be the county commission part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11187)|
| 3:06:29| is just frankly not authorized by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11189)|
| 3:06:34| So that's why that section has been included in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11194)|
| 3:06:38| That was section 6.40 or something very much like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11198)|
| 3:06:43| has been in the code for decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| going back to when I started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11205)|
| 3:06:46| when the world was young in the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11206)|
| 3:06:50| And it used to be routine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11210)|
| 3:06:53| that uses on review were heard by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| I was away for about a decade and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| So I don't know what's happened in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| but they apparently are not being heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| by commission anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11221)|
| 3:07:02| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11222)|
| 3:07:03| I think that's consistent with the BFI case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11223)|
| 3:07:06| And so I think 6.40 is like a vestigial organ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11226)|
| 3:07:11| that next needs to be excised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11231)|
| 3:07:14| And so I would suggest that whatever you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| leave that language in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11237)|
| 3:07:21| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| Commissioner Schell-Sunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| So would it make sense for us to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11245)|
| 3:07:28| for planning staff to get with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11248)|
| 3:07:32| to put this in black and white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11252)|
| 3:07:33| what we've all kind of seemed to come to an understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11253)|
| 3:07:37| and bring it before us next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| Okay, so I'm gonna make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11259)|
| 3:07:40| I mean, is that the route of putting it in black and white?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11260)|
| 3:07:45| Is it your desire to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11265)|
| 3:07:45| and have it brought back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11265)|
| 3:07:47| Or do you wanna try to get some movement tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| so we can get this before county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| I mean, the county commission has passed an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11272)|
| 3:07:54| asking us what we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11274)|
| 3:07:56| our opinion on this, to send back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11276)|
| 3:08:00| I mean, we're responding to county commission's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11280)|
| 3:08:04| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11284)|
| 3:08:05| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| But I think there's a couple different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11287)|
| 3:08:08| that you can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11288)|
| 3:08:09| Like we don't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11289)|
| 3:08:10| planning staff would not be the one to draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11290)|
| 3:08:13| necessarily the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11293)|
| 3:08:14| We would rely on the expertise of the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11294)|
| 3:08:18| to help us provide this clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11298)|
| 3:08:20| that Director Moyers has identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11300)|
| 3:08:23| So you can send it forward and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11303)|
| 3:08:27| in terms of keeping BZA should continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| to hear use on reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| but this language needs to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| as part of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11312)|
| 3:08:34| You can send it forward that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11314)|
| 3:08:35| or you can, or we could pause for a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| and draft some additional language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11319)|
| 3:08:43| Hear that and then pass that next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| to send back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11325)|
| 3:08:47| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11327)|
| 3:08:48| So that's, yeah, a motion to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11328)|
| 3:08:53| our planning staff get with the county law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11333)|
| 3:08:57| to refine what we think our intent is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11337)|
| 3:09:00| to bring back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11343)|
| 3:09:04| Before we get to a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11344)|
| 3:09:05| we've got several lights on, Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11345)|
| 3:09:08| then I'll go to Uden, and then Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11348)|
| 3:09:10| I just want to make sure that in the working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11350)|
| 3:09:14| of if that's what passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11354)|
| 3:09:16| that we not lose the opportunity for community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11356)|
| 3:09:20| to go to BZA for appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| I don't think that that's what is being suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11362)|
| 3:09:25| in the planning commission body right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11365)|
| 3:09:26| but I just want to make sure that that is articulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11366)|
| 3:09:30| clearly in the rewrite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11370)|
| 3:09:35| Commissioner Uden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| Yeah, I don't hear anybody, any dissension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11377)|
| 3:09:41| in what we all are now talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11381)|
| 3:09:44| sitting on the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| and as Tasha stated, as long as we're verbalizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11386)|
| 3:09:51| and voting on the fact that we would request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11391)|
| 3:09:55| development plans being dropped from appeal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| but the rest of those use or abuse to remain intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11399)|
| 3:10:04| I think that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11404)|
| 3:10:06| A, and then to take care of the pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11406)|
| 3:10:12| to county commission, I think we need to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| and once we've done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11414)|
| 3:10:15| I think we're all on the same page here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| Let's get that to the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| They can, it's the county commission's responsibility anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11419)|
| 3:10:22| and let's just get on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11422)|
| 3:10:24| There's no reason to bring this back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11424)|
| 3:10:26| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11426)|
| 3:10:27| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11427)|
| 3:10:28| Well, and I'm gonna echo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11428)|
| 3:10:29| So I wrote down, as everybody's been talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11429)|
| 3:10:31| jotted down the three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11431)|
| 3:10:33| One, that we want to leave some use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| except we want to remove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11435)|
| 3:10:37| number two, the development concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| as part of the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| and number three, we want to remove the avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| to appeal to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11443)|
| 3:10:45| Those are the three things that we want to direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11445)|
| 3:10:50| back to county commission to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| So I guess my question is, can we amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11453)|
| 3:10:56| would Commissioner Schell show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11456)|
| 3:10:58| allow those three to be put onto his motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11458)|
| 3:11:02| as the three things we want to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| back to county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11464)|
| 3:11:05| If Commissioner Schell so agrees with your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| I'm just gonna withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| Someone else make a motion, I withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11469)|
| 3:11:11| You can accept that as a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11471)|
| 3:11:15| to your motion, Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11475)|
| 3:11:18| Can I add something in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11478)|
| 3:11:20| Because where this conversation began| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11480)|
| 3:11:24| was addressing the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11484)|
| 3:11:27| and we are not talking about that any longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11487)|
| 3:11:30| but everyone has agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11490)|
| 3:11:32| We're removing the development concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11492)|
| 3:11:34| as part of the PR, so we're removing all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| from being able to go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| All of that as part of the PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11499)|
| 3:11:40| will no longer be appealed to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11500)|
| 3:11:42| Other things can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11504)|
| 3:11:46| Okay, one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11506)|
| 3:11:47| There were ambiguities raised about the PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11507)|
| 3:11:50| by the law director, by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| and saying we really need to just look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11513)|
| 3:11:57| And we do, but I think that's what we're gonna be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11517)|
| 3:12:02| when we get through the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11522)|
| 3:12:05| and hopefully the county will move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| with amendments to the zoning text and rewrite of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| But let's get this one done first and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| I'm gonna ask, what would you say was your number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| So the first, so what I wrote down was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11538)|
| 3:12:19| that we leave most all other use zone reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11539)|
| 3:12:22| with appeal to BZA, except we remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11542)|
| 3:12:25| the development concept plan as part of the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11545)|
| 3:12:28| That cannot be appealed to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| That can't be appealed there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11550)|
| 3:12:32| Development concept plan can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11552)|
| 3:12:35| The way I read it, it cannot be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| But it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11557)|
| 3:12:40| I mean, in recent times, they have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11560)|
| 3:12:42| Functionally, there's been a conflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11562)|
| 3:12:44| and so this would be a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11564)|
| 3:12:46| Correct, that's why I'm adding in the clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11566)|
| 3:12:48| that it cannot be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11568)|
| 3:12:51| So under the law, either the law says you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11571)|
| 3:12:54| or the law usually just says you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| If it doesn't say you can't, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11576)|
| 3:12:58| So in this instance, we're going back and saying you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11578)|
| 3:13:02| The third one is, we direct county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11582)|
| 3:13:05| that our wishes are to remove themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11585)|
| 3:13:08| as an appeal body and leave it with BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11588)|
| 3:13:11| for the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11591)|
| 3:13:12| So the county commission is taken off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11592)|
| 3:13:15| That's a motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11595)|
| 3:13:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11596)|
| 3:13:17| It's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11597)|
| 3:13:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11598)|
| 3:13:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11598)|
| 3:13:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11599)|
| 3:13:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11599)|
| 3:13:22| Commissioner Eddie Smith and a second by Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11607)|
| 3:13:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| Thank you, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11612)|
| 3:13:33| You're very welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11613)|
| 3:13:34| Thanks for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11614)|
| 3:13:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11616)|
| 3:13:37| The next item is agenda item 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11617)|
| 3:13:41| I just want to let the public understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| on this particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11623)|
| 3:13:44| This is the Primos Land Company land development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11624)|
| 3:13:49| We are not taking any action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11629)|
| 3:13:53| That'll be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| Tonight is only a presentation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11635)|
| 3:13:58| allows the commission to hear the proposal by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11638)|
| 3:14:04| and for any comments the commission wants to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| We are going to give them 10 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11647)|
| 3:14:10| to make their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11650)|
| 3:14:12| Likewise, even though it's not required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11652)|
| 3:14:15| we're going to give the public 10 minutes to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11655)|
| 3:14:19| to what they're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11659)|
| 3:14:20| But again, we're not making any decisions this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11660)|
| 3:14:25| Mr. Sanderson, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11667)|
| 3:14:28| Address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11668)|
| 3:14:28| You have up to 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11668)|
| 3:14:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11670)|
| 3:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11673)|
| 3:14:34| I'm Josh Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11674)|
| 3:14:35| I'm with Smithfield Homes at 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11675)|
| 3:14:40| And I've had the privilege of standing before you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| almost 10 years now doing zonings and concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11684)|
| 3:14:47| plans and developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11687)|
| 3:14:50| Prior to me drawing the shortest straw amongst my cousins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| to be the point man, Rocky Smith would always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11693)|
| 3:14:56| present these concepts and zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11696)|
| 3:14:59| And before him was his dad, my grandfather, Rufus Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11699)|
| 3:15:05| So standing in front of you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11705)|
| 3:15:07| is not only decades, but generations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| of development and developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11709)|
| 3:15:12| And trying to make my point, this isn't new to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11712)|
| 3:15:16| What is new to us is this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11716)|
| 3:15:19| What we're doing here today is the planned development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11719)|
| 3:15:23| that's newly been adopted and, from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11723)|
| 3:15:26| will be the first time a subdivision comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11726)|
| 3:15:29| in front of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11729)|
| 3:15:30| I know the stadium came and used the same process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11730)|
| 3:15:32| but this will be the first time a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11732)|
| 3:15:35| So with that being said, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11735)|
| 3:15:38| to present what we have and kind of the picture and the vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11738)|
| 3:15:43| I wasn't in, I'm not going to go over numbers and details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11743)|
| 3:15:49| and get in all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11749)|
| 3:15:50| From my understanding, tell you all what we envision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11750)|
| 3:15:56| So what we have tonight is, first time ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11756)|
| 3:15:59| we are showing you what we see as the final picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11759)|
| 3:16:03| the final, when it's all built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11763)|
| 3:16:05| what we want it to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11765)|
| 3:16:08| That's the first time we've ever done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11768)|
| 3:16:09| We don't have any other tricks up our sleeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| We don't have a zone here, do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| We don't have to go find a builder to build these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| We don't have to go find a developer to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| This is us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11777)|
| 3:16:17| We're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11777)|
| 3:16:18| We're going to do it in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11778)|
| 3:16:19| What we're doing is presenting the public, the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11779)|
| 3:16:21| commission, this is what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11781)|
| 3:16:24| This is the best effort we know to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11784)|
| 3:16:30| You're pulling up the plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| And I'm going to kind of dissect what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11792)|
| 3:16:35| and how we got to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| It's a master plan community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| When I mean master plan, we're not taking 20 acres here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| We're going to do our normal Smith-built homes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11802)|
| 3:16:44| and then go 20 acres here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11804)|
| 3:16:46| We're going to lay it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11806)|
| 3:16:47| We're going to lay it out to where we have phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11807)|
| 3:16:51| or the phasing where we have all price points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11811)|
| 3:16:52| We have the higher end, we have the medium income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11812)|
| 3:16:55| and we have the affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11815)|
| 3:16:57| That's a big thing with master plan communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| because sometimes you just get all the high end up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11819)|
| 3:17:02| or you get all the affordable on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11822)|
| 3:17:04| We're going to try to get all price points going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11824)|
| 3:17:06| simultaneously at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11826)|
| 3:17:09| So we've drawn the lot parameters and the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11829)|
| 3:17:14| to a project that we're doing down in Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11834)|
| 3:17:16| now that's called what's called Rarity Ridge, now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11836)|
| 3:17:18| called The Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11838)|
| 3:17:20| It has rear entry, alley loaded, single family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11840)|
| 3:17:25| meaning you have a front door, or obviously a front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11845)|
| 3:17:29| You have a front porch facing the main road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| with on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11851)|
| 3:17:32| You have an alleyway where you access your garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11852)|
| 3:17:36| This isn't a new concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| This is North Shore Town Center, it's kind of the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11858)|
| 3:17:40| But we're doing it down in The Preserve at Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11860)|
| 3:17:43| It has been an incredible project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11863)|
| 3:17:45| It has been in high demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11865)|
| 3:17:47| We've gotten the best feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11867)|
| 3:17:48| It is a front porch living feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11868)|
| 3:17:52| It's something that we weren't used to, but we went down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11872)|
| 3:17:56| and we're trying it, and it's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| I do want to invite you all down there any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11878)|
| 3:18:00| and I will say that at the end of the meeting again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11880)|
| 3:18:04| Again, we also have in here not only the rear entry homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| but our normal standard, what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11887)|
| 3:18:09| our affordable product from 1,800 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11889)|
| 3:18:13| to 2,900 square feet, as affordable as we can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11893)|
| 3:18:18| Right now, we're building in Karnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11898)|
| 3:18:21| as the best we possibly can in this crazy market with supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11901)|
| 3:18:24| chain and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11904)|
| 3:18:25| So we will take our Smithville Homes product and put it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11905)|
| 3:18:31| We also have the estate homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11911)|
| 3:18:34| The estate homes in the back with the hill slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11914)|
| 3:18:37| with the terrain, with everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11917)|
| 3:18:38| just makes sense to make larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11918)|
| 3:18:43| We have a product to go on there that we're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| building down in The Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11925)|
| 3:18:47| Some of them are 3,600 square foot homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11927)|
| 3:18:48| We have a 4,200 square foot home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| Day three car garages, we can't build them fast enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| We're not going to build them fast enough right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| This is a crazy market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| No one can build fast enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11939)|
| 3:19:02| That's kind of dissecting the single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11942)|
| 3:19:05| Another little design aspect, the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11945)|
| 3:19:07| we designed it with the main thoroughfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| the boulevard entrance going through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11949)|
| 3:19:11| no driveways are connecting to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11951)|
| 3:19:13| So you're not going to have driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11953)|
| 3:19:14| You're going to have a main thoroughfare all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11954)|
| 3:19:16| through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11956)|
| 3:19:17| Those are rear entry with the alleyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11957)|
| 3:19:18| So there's no driveways connecting directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| to the main drag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11960)|
| 3:19:21| So you're going to have a full thoroughfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11961)|
| 3:19:23| We thought that'd be a good design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| With the single family, they'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| their own private amenities, pool, pavilion, park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11967)|
| 3:19:32| their own parking, as big as we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11972)|
| 3:19:36| to make it for the 525 homes that will be on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11976)|
| 3:19:41| That's that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11981)|
| 3:19:43| I said I wasn't going to go into numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| but if you were to take that portion of the property, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11985)|
| 3:19:47| is roughly 215 acres, we're getting 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11987)|
| 3:19:52| We had this layout, so it's 524 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11992)|
| 3:19:54| That's 2.4 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11994)|
| 3:19:57| Again, we'll have all this studied next time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11997)|
| 3:19:59| we appear in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=11999)|
| 3:20:02| On the south side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| we got what we think is a good use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12006)|
| 3:20:11| And the anchor, the biggest portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12011)|
| 3:20:13| and the strongest part of it is the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12013)|
| 3:20:17| It's all anchored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12017)|
| 3:20:18| That's the most beautiful land in Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12018)|
| 3:20:19| wrapped around with Beaver Creek access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12019)|
| 3:20:23| And we want to give that, not sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12023)|
| 3:20:25| not do some crazy tax exchange or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12025)|
| 3:20:27| Give it to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12027)|
| 3:20:29| I know there'll be some more communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12029)|
| 3:20:32| and some conversations about funding, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12032)|
| 3:20:35| But this is, we think, and I invite all y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12035)|
| 3:20:38| to come down there and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12038)|
| 3:20:39| that that's an incredible place for a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12039)|
| 3:20:43| Not only do we have the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12043)|
| 3:20:44| but we also have some commercial with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| What we see on the largest block to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12047)|
| 3:20:50| the largest, an anchor restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12050)|
| 3:20:53| not to name any names or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| but we see an anchor restaurant going in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| that's overlooking the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| In the commercial, we see some other boutiques,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12059)|
| 3:21:02| some other, like a pizza shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12062)|
| 3:21:06| or a general store with a pharmacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12066)|
| 3:21:11| stuff that you can get your common household needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| some other restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| something that these people can walk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12077)|
| 3:21:18| To the left of the common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12078)|
| 3:21:21| or the commercial is going to be a senior living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12081)|
| 3:21:24| or 55 and older,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12084)|
| 3:21:28| with obviously a master's on the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12088)|
| 3:21:31| or one level units for 55 and older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12091)|
| 3:21:34| And next to that is going to be our townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12094)|
| 3:21:36| townhomes for young professionals to live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| townhomes that are affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| Try to get them under 300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12099)|
| 3:21:42| and have an affordable product for the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12102)|
| 3:21:43| that are either maybe working from home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12103)|
| 3:21:45| or commuting downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| The young professionals that are just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| wanna buy something now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| And then to justify the commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| and to justify all the economics that go into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12114)|
| 3:21:59| is gonna be the multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12119)|
| 3:22:00| That intensifies the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12120)|
| 3:22:03| getting us over 1,100 front doors in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12123)|
| 3:22:07| So that's the black and white picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12127)|
| 3:22:12| That's the basis of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| And I know next month we will talk about the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12134)|
| 3:22:17| the lot sizes, the density and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12137)|
| 3:22:20| but that's how we've laid this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12140)|
| 3:22:23| One thing to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12143)|
| 3:22:24| we will be involved in every step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12144)|
| 3:22:26| I was in the Smith family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12146)|
| 3:22:27| We're not gonna have to go call a out-of-town builder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12147)|
| 3:22:30| or an out-of-town developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12150)|
| 3:22:31| We're not gonna have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12151)|
| 3:22:32| We will be involved in every trinket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12152)|
| 3:22:35| and every decision going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| And that's kind of unique where you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12157)|
| 3:22:39| you don't have different parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12159)|
| 3:22:42| trying to make different decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12162)|
| 3:22:43| This will go in the best interest of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12163)|
| 3:22:48| So again, that's the black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12168)|
| 3:22:50| What I'm gonna do is give you a visual of what we envision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12170)|
| 3:22:53| We envision a family that can wake up Saturday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12173)|
| 3:22:57| walk down, grab a cup of coffee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12177)|
| 3:23:01| go down to the park, play for a few hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12181)|
| 3:23:04| go back up, swim, walk back to their house, get ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12184)|
| 3:23:08| go down, listen to some live music at the amphitheater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12188)|
| 3:23:11| and then go to dinner at the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12191)|
| 3:23:13| and walk back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12193)|
| 3:23:14| That's a, I know it's cheesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12194)|
| 3:23:18| I can't believe I even said that, but it's a visual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12198)|
| 3:23:21| It's a visual of families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12201)|
| 3:23:22| They don't have to get in the car on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12202)|
| 3:23:23| It's a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12203)|
| 3:23:26| That's what we have down at the preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| That's a lot larger development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12208)|
| 3:23:29| but that's what we're going for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12209)|
| 3:23:31| and that's what we wanna go for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12211)|
| 3:23:33| It is the Smiths, it's gonna be a legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12213)|
| 3:23:40| We have some subdivisions on our resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12220)|
| 3:23:43| Broad Acres, Timberlake, Barrington, Shan Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12223)|
| 3:23:47| We have our resume, but this will be a generational staple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12227)|
| 3:23:52| for not only the Smith family, but also for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12232)|
| 3:23:59| With this picture, with this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12239)|
| 3:24:00| there's gonna be growing pains, we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12240)|
| 3:24:02| We know traffic, we know West Emory, we know the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12242)|
| 3:24:06| We know all this, you all know we know all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12246)|
| 3:24:09| because we're good at it, and like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12249)|
| 3:24:10| we've been doing this for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12250)|
| 3:24:11| We will get there, and there will be growing pains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| and what we need to decide as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| do we want this, or do we not want this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12255)|
| 3:24:20| As a citizen, I think we want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12260)|
| 3:24:23| As a member of the Knox planning, or advanced Knox planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12263)|
| 3:24:28| this is all I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12268)|
| 3:24:29| We want this kind of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12269)|
| 3:24:30| and maybe I'm speaking out of turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12270)|
| 3:24:32| But during this process, because it's new to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12272)|
| 3:24:35| and new to me, new to all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12275)|
| 3:24:37| we're trying to be as transparent as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12277)|
| 3:24:39| We built a website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12279)|
| 3:24:40| It's on this QR code here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12280)|
| 3:24:42| and it's smithbilthomes.com slash belltown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12282)|
| 3:24:44| I want you to invite all your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12284)|
| 3:24:46| anyone that wants to ask a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12286)|
| 3:24:48| can go on the website, ask a question, we will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12288)|
| 3:24:51| It's public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12291)|
| 3:24:52| There's a polling, people get their opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| they can post a comment, negative, positive, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12294)|
| 3:24:57| The map's on there, as we get more pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| and more details as we go through this entire process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| will be posted on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12301)|
| 3:25:02| Just again, I'm not saying that's an answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12302)|
| 3:25:04| and that's anything, but that is a opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| to be transparent in this entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| My phone number, my email, 100% available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12309)|
| 3:25:12| Rocky Smith's in the, back here behind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12312)|
| 3:25:16| we are approachable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12316)|
| 3:25:19| Please, please, if you have a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12319)|
| 3:25:22| if you don't think this is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12322)|
| 3:25:23| or you want to express something, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12323)|

| 3:25:31| I'll show you the houses, show you the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| show you kind of exactly what we can build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12333)|
| 3:25:35| and what we want to see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| My time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12337)|
| 3:25:39| Thank you all for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12339)|
| 3:25:41| We're excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12341)|
| 3:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12342)|
| 3:25:42| Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12342)|
| 3:25:43| And I appreciate the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12343)|
| 3:25:46| and the access to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12346)|
| 3:25:48| I would encourage you to meet with the community in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12348)|
| 3:25:53| Maybe hold some meetings with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| so they can air their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12355)|
| 3:25:58| and hopefully you all can learn from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12358)|
| 3:26:00| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12360)|
| 3:26:03| Because we don't get lots of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| can you clarify for me what the next step is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12365)|
| 3:26:08| Today we're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12368)|
| 3:26:10| And what should this body expect to do next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12370)|
| 3:26:15| Well, the purpose of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| or this particular presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12377)|
| 3:26:20| is for you all to provide feedback to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12380)|
| 3:26:23| What other things would you like to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| They have not made a formal application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| so that would be the next step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12387)|
| 3:26:28| is for them to make a formal application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12388)|
| 3:26:32| for you all to consider their concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12392)|
| 3:26:36| And part of that will be the traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12396)|
| 3:26:38| that they will also have to conduct as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12398)|
| 3:26:41| So it is a multi-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12401)|
| 3:26:42| So that will come before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12402)|
| 3:26:44| and then it'll go on to County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12404)|
| 3:26:46| and then it'll come back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12406)|
| 3:26:47| for a final plan and final review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| where you will be reviewing it for substantial compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| for anything, for the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| that you had given them before, if you approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12413)|
| 3:26:57| So today is seeking feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12417)|
| 3:27:01| or today is just, now you see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| think about it, and feedback comes next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12423)|
| 3:27:05| No, the intent, the way that it's drafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| is for you all to be able to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| and provide feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12429)|
| 3:27:10| So think about this as a workshop, in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12430)|
| 3:27:16| Sure, well, I'll tell you what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12436)|
| 3:27:19| we have some people lined up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12439)|
| 3:27:22| and let them, let me recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12442)|
| 3:27:25| Rick Harbin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12445)|
| 3:27:29| and then Danny Walls, and Vince Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12449)|
| 3:27:34| And again, we'll give your groups a total of 10 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12454)|
| 3:27:39| so if you could split it up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| three minutes each, and then we'll turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12461)|
| 3:27:45| to Commission for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12465)|
| 3:27:48| Thank you, my name's Rick Harbin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12468)|
| 3:27:50| and I live at 7615 Rio Grande Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12470)|
| 3:27:54| that is in Norte Villa subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12474)|
| 3:27:56| which is on the east border of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12476)|
| 3:28:04| Norte Villa and Worcester Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12484)|
| 3:28:08| has the same concerns that I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12488)|
| 3:28:12| and that's why I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12492)|
| 3:28:14| I will make a note that I sent a letter to the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12494)|
| 3:28:20| through their site, and if you would take the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12500)|
| 3:28:24| to review that, it's really my thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12504)|
| 3:28:29| and the neighbor's thoughts in a nutshell of what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12509)|
| 3:28:36| The reason that we are here is because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12516)|
| 3:28:41| you know, it's a big, massive project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12521)|
| 3:28:44| and more power to Mr. Sanderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12524)|
| 3:28:49| with all due respect, he said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12529)|
| 3:28:52| it will be a blissful place for these new people to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12532)|
| 3:29:00| What'd be blissful to the people that live there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12540)|
| 3:29:02| is for this development not to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12542)|
| 3:29:07| Emory Road is not ready for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12547)|
| 3:29:10| Emory Road is a rural area that is getting very congested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12550)|
| 3:29:15| but the reason that the people live in Norte Villa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12555)|
| 3:29:18| and Worcester Heights and the other subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12558)|
| 3:29:21| are because they want a nice yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12561)|
| 3:29:24| They don't want the congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12564)|
| 3:29:25| They don't want all the traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12565)|
| 3:29:30| They don't want high-density homes next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12570)|
| 3:29:34| That's the reason they live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12574)|
| 3:29:35| The average lot size in Norte Villa is 9.10 acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12575)|
| 3:29:42| In Worcester Heights, it's 7.10 or 7 tenths of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12582)|
| 3:29:47| When you take the proposed plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12587)|
| 3:29:51| and you go to the average size lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12591)|
| 3:29:54| which is .114 of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12594)|
| 3:30:00| that is smaller than a mobile home site lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12600)|
| 3:30:07| And to check that, where I got the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12607)|
| 3:30:10| across the hill here, it's Grand Oaks Mobile Home Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12610)|
| 3:30:16| Their lots are 2 tenths of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12616)|
| 3:30:20| So think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12620)|
| 3:30:22| Another thing is, if you were looking at the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12622)|
| 3:30:28| before it was developed, it's 45% wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12628)|
| 3:30:34| You have 300 acres of wildlife that we enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12634)|
| 3:30:39| Deer, wild turkey, any native animal in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12639)|
| 3:30:44| We enjoy those animals running through our backyards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12644)|
| 3:30:48| every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12648)|
| 3:30:49| It is bliss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| And we don't want that to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12652)|
| 3:30:54| There's 300 acres of animals, wildlife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12654)|
| 3:30:57| that will be displaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12657)|
| 3:31:00| Not to mention that out of the 300 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12660)|
| 3:31:04| that is now pervious, which means it soaks up rainwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12664)|
| 3:31:10| it's going to be 85% non-pervious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12670)|
| 3:31:14| which means it's runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12674)|
| 3:31:17| We already have flooding every major rain at Beaver Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12677)|
| 3:31:25| which is on the flood plain here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| that they're going to be happy to give the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12687)|
| 3:31:33| On top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12695)|
| 3:31:46| Mr. Harber, if you could wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| Round it up, I'd be happy to, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12708)|
| 3:31:50| We have, out of 1,100 proposed units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12710)|
| 3:31:55| that's a minimum of 2,200 cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12715)|
| 3:31:59| coming out of the same entrance or the two entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12719)|
| 3:32:03| every day, morning and night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12723)|
| 3:32:06| Emory Road will not handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12726)|
| 3:32:08| And I beg of the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12728)|
| 3:32:14| to at least give us a development we can live with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12734)|
| 3:32:18| instead of a heartache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12738)|
| 3:32:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12740)|
| 3:32:21| Thank you, Mr. Harber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12741)|
| 3:32:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12742)|
| 3:32:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12743)|
| 3:32:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12744)|
| 3:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12745)|
| 3:32:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12746)|
| 3:32:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12746)|
| 3:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12747)|
| 3:32:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12748)|

| 3:32:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12751)|
| 3:32:31| Mr. Griffin to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12751)|
| 3:32:34| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12754)|
| 3:32:35| Mr. Chairman, I'm Vince Griffin, 7428 Bridgefield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12755)|
| 3:32:40| I'm on the opposite side of West Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12760)|
| 3:32:42| than where Rick Harbin is at just spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12762)|
| 3:32:47| And I've also been asked by Danny Valls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12767)|
| 3:32:51| which is also a registered speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12771)|
| 3:32:54| to present his prepared statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12774)|
| 3:32:56| He and I are walking buddies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12776)|
| 3:32:59| and we try to get across Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12779)|
| 3:33:02| regularly to keep ourselves in some what shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12782)|
| 3:33:04| Anyway, he collapsed while we were walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12784)|
| 3:33:07| and he's in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12787)|
| 3:33:09| So I'm gonna not say what I was having to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12789)|
| 3:33:13| because it's pretty much covered in what Danny says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12793)|
| 3:33:18| And I'll read this as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12798)|
| 3:33:21| My name is Danny Valls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12801)|
| 3:33:22| My wife, Carol, and I live in the North Viller subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12802)|
| 3:33:26| on the eastern end of a 4.5 mile corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12806)|
| 3:33:30| of West Emory Road between Beaver Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12810)|
| 3:33:33| and Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12813)|
| 3:33:34| I'm here today speaking on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12814)|
| 3:33:37| of the North Viller Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12817)|
| 3:33:40| not as adversaries, but as partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12820)|
| 3:33:43| to express our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12823)|
| 3:33:45| regarding the proposed Belltown development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12825)|
| 3:33:49| The short West Emory Road corridor is developing rapidly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12829)|
| 3:33:54| and will soon become unbearable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12834)|
| 3:33:56| if infrastructure is unprepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12836)|
| 3:33:58| and rapid growth is unmanaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12838)|
| 3:34:02| Our Homeowners Association recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12842)|
| 3:34:05| that growth in our popular community is inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12845)|
| 3:34:09| We are not necessarily against the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12849)|
| 3:34:11| on West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| We do ask that Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| in concert with the Tennessee Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12855)|
| 3:34:19| be proactive on road construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12859)|
| 3:34:22| and infrastructure improvements prior to growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12862)|
| 3:34:27| Knox County has an opportunity to do growth right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12867)|
| 3:34:32| in this relatively short residential corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12872)|
| 3:34:37| before it becomes a dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| and frustrating road to travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12879)|
| 3:34:41| which I might add, it's getting there real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12881)|
| 3:34:45| West Emory Road residents can avoid the headaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12885)|
| 3:34:48| others have suffered with the lessons learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12888)|
| 3:34:51| elsewhere in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| We must not be reactive to growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12893)|
| 3:34:57| and force neighbors to live with overcrowded roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12897)|
| 3:34:58| in schools for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12898)|
| 3:35:00| but let's take the opportunity to be proactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12900)|
| 3:35:03| where we temper growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| while giving supporting infrastructure opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12905)|
| 3:35:08| to keep up with the developers' dreams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12908)|
| 3:35:11| With 1,100 projected three to four bedroom home units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12911)|
| 3:35:15| in Belltown development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12915)|
| 3:35:17| West Emory Road and our local schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| will be severely impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| Belltown will be conservatively pushing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12921)|
| 3:35:26| over 1,000 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12926)|
| 3:35:27| and 1,500 or more additional vehicles onto West Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12927)|
| 3:35:32| at nearly the same time each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12932)|
| 3:35:35| The traffic load of Belltown will be adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12935)|
| 3:35:37| to the daily rush hour nightmares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| both morning and evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| and it's already been exasperating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| for the people in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12943)|
| 3:35:48| Keep in mind that there are other significant developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12948)|
| 3:35:51| along West Emory that are already under construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12951)|
| 3:35:55| and adding to the traffic load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12955)|
| 3:35:57| Emory Orchard, a 90 unit development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| of three and four bedroom homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| half a mile west of Belltown in Creek Valley Estates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12961)|
| 3:36:04| another 41 unit four to five bedroom home development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12964)|
| 3:36:08| only three miles or so further west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12968)|
| 3:36:10| These two developments are sure to add additional students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| and 600 or more vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12974)|
| 3:36:15| reaching well over 15,000 daily trips on West Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12975)|
| 3:36:20| and a population increase of approximately 4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12980)|
| 3:36:25| In the proposed commercial aspect of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12985)|
| 3:36:27| the developer suggests wonderful amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12987)|
| 3:36:31| such as restaurants, dog parks, ball fields, amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12991)|
| 3:36:34| These are offered as extended community assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12994)|
| 3:36:37| which, again, invites more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=12997)|
| 3:36:40| Of course, schools will have to follow population growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13000)|
| 3:36:44| when we must grow roads in place before homes are built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13004)|
| 3:36:47| for the safety of all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13007)|
| 3:36:50| Vehicle traffic numbers are not just a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13010)|
| 3:36:52| of time and convenience, but safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13012)|
| 3:36:54| The traffic on West Emory is already dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13014)|
| 3:36:57| as evidenced by several memorial crosses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13017)|
| 3:37:00| placed along West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13020)|
| 3:37:02| A 30 to 40% increase in car and school bus traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13022)|
| 3:37:05| will be a recipe for disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| TDOT's road improvements are in the works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13027)|
| 3:37:10| and Belltown's solution must be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13030)|
| 3:37:12| prior to the sale of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13032)|
| 3:37:15| We ask that you simply maintain the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13035)|
| 3:37:18| and character of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13038)|
| 3:37:20| We live here because we enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13040)|
| 3:37:22| relatively suburban rural attributes of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13042)|
| 3:37:28| We are certainly willing to embrace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13048)|
| 3:37:30| the growth of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13050)|
| 3:37:32| but expect MPC to work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13052)|
| 3:37:35| and the developer to keep our part of Knox County special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13055)|
| 3:37:38| to everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13058)|
| 3:37:40| Let's be honest here, the characteristics of Pal Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13060)|
| 3:37:43| today are the very qualities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13063)|
| 3:37:47| that draw people to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13067)|
| 3:37:49| Good schools, safe roads, bearable traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| A diligent and respectful developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13072)|
| 3:37:54| should always create a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13074)|
| 3:37:56| with similar characteristics to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13076)|
| 3:37:59| where they build and ideally make it even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13079)|
| 3:38:03| As we all know, bigger is not always better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13083)|
| 3:38:06| but a well-conceived property built development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13086)|
| 3:38:09| with outstanding amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13089)|
| 3:38:11| and with quality infrastructure support in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13091)|
| 3:38:16| prior to construction make a project like Belltown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13096)|
| 3:38:20| a point of pride in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13100)|
| 3:38:23| Let me summarize all this in simpler terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13103)|
| 3:38:27| that I believe we can all relate to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13107)|
| 3:38:31| It is a project for a 4,500 seat baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13111)|
| 3:38:35| and playing games every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| shouldn't be the state and county significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13117)|
| 3:38:42| should not the state and county significant road work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13122)|
| 3:38:46| and infrastructure upgrades be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13126)|
| 3:38:49| prior to the safe opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13129)|
| 3:38:54| of the first day of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13134)|
| 3:38:57| Why would you not do the same for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| of both West Emory and Belltown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13140)|
| 3:39:03| And thank you very much for our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13143)|
| 3:39:06| Thank you very much, thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13146)|
| 3:39:09| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13149)|
| 3:39:14| Yeah, I've got a few things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13154)|
| 3:39:18| Number one, to Commissioner Adams' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13158)|
| 3:39:21| I think it would be helpful just to give us a little something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13161)|
| 3:39:27| from staff as to what they've gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13167)|
| 3:39:30| what their role has been with this developer up to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13170)|
| 3:39:34| I mean, I know that it was their responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| to come present their vision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13178)|
| 3:39:40| We're just here to listen and we're not going to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13180)|
| 3:39:43| obviously, on anything or give direction of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13183)|
| 3:39:46| and ask questions and maybe get some feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13186)|
| 3:39:48| But is there any type of feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13188)|
| 3:39:51| that we would get from staff at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13191)|
| 3:39:53| or is it all going to wait on the next round?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13193)|
| 3:39:56| It would all wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13196)|
| 3:39:57| So as part of this process in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| we had a pre-application consultation with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13199)|
| 3:40:03| and it was really just to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13203)|
| 3:40:04| what the plan development process would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13204)|
| 3:40:06| Obviously, this is the first one that has been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13206)|
| 3:40:09| or potentially being proposed in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| And so really what we did, they shared their plans with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13211)|
| 3:40:14| and we shared with them the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13214)|
| 3:40:16| that they would need to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13216)|
| 3:40:17| in order to have this considered for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13217)|
| 3:40:21| And that's essentially the information that we gave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13221)|
| 3:40:24| And obviously, you know, recommending that they do need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13224)|
| 3:40:27| to pursue the traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13227)|
| 3:40:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13230)|
| 3:40:31| The second thing I'd like to say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13231)|
| 3:40:34| obviously, this is completely out of the box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13234)|
| 3:40:37| compared to what is out there in the Powell Park community now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13237)|
| 3:40:44| I would give the residents that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13244)|
| 3:40:47| I do think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13247)|
| 3:40:50| Chris, can you speak a little closer to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13250)|
| 3:40:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13252)|
| 3:40:53| I do think that there's more of a traditional density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13253)|
| 3:40:56| on that north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13256)|
| 3:40:58| And having all the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13258)|
| 3:41:03| You know, there's 400 multifamily units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13263)|
| 3:41:05| on this particular development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13265)|
| 3:41:07| and all of those are on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13267)|
| 3:41:08| backing up to this Hallsdale Power sewerage treatment plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13268)|
| 3:41:12| in the park and where the retail is and the amphitheater is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13272)|
| 3:41:18| which would activate all of those types of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13278)|
| 3:41:20| and you're not going to get those types of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13280)|
| 3:41:22| without some density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13282)|
| 3:41:23| So, you know, we all have been encouraging one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13283)|
| 3:41:28| to raise the bar from a development standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13288)|
| 3:41:31| and the fact that one of the oldest affordable builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13291)|
| 3:41:36| in this town is at least making an attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13296)|
| 3:41:40| to put their neck out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13300)|
| 3:41:43| and to come up with this sort of plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13303)|
| 3:41:46| I don't know if this will ever get approved or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13306)|
| 3:41:50| but I certainly would want to commend Smithville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13310)|
| 3:41:53| for giving it a heck of a shot here up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13313)|
| 3:41:57| and being the guinea pig and really going for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13317)|
| 3:42:01| in this particular development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| because you've got a mix of really everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13323)|
| 3:42:06| live, work, and play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13326)|
| 3:42:07| and I know the mayor is big on parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13327)|
| 3:42:12| and access to the creeks and greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13332)|
| 3:42:19| and all those sorts of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13339)|
| 3:42:21| so there's a lot of different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13341)|
| 3:42:23| that this site plan brings that I think is commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13343)|
| 3:42:29| One of the questions I would have for the developer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13349)|
| 3:42:35| Josh, just speak to the south side of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13355)|
| 3:42:39| You know, you've got a lot of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| You've got the multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13361)|
| 3:42:42| You've got the retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13362)|
| 3:42:43| You've got the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| In my simple mind, sitting next to Jeff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13365)|
| 3:42:48| he said he was simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13368)|
| 3:42:49| so I guess we're both simpletons here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13369)|
| 3:42:53| Typically, you would develop a lot of the single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13373)|
| 3:42:57| or get a lot of the density going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13377)|
| 3:42:59| before you would do the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13379)|
| 3:43:01| and the other sorts of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13381)|
| 3:43:02| because you just couldn't sustain the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13382)|
| 3:43:07| that you'd spend on the commercial piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13387)|
| 3:43:09| until you got the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13389)|
| 3:43:10| and the folks there to walk there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13390)|
| 3:43:12| like you were talking about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13392)|
| 3:43:14| Can you speak a little bit to the timing and the phasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13394)|
| 3:43:17| Would you do the park first on the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13397)|
| 3:43:20| build the spine roads, build the residential to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13400)|
| 3:43:23| and then come back in and do the rest of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13403)|
| 3:43:25| or what would your vision be with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13405)|
| 3:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| Our bread and butter, obviously, we build homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13411)|
| 3:43:33| so we're going to focus on the single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13413)|
| 3:43:35| but also knowing that the park is the most important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13415)|
| 3:43:38| we're going to build the spine road down to the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13418)|
| 3:43:40| and get the park going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13420)|
| 3:43:44| As this whole project fills out, we're not commercial guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13424)|
| 3:43:48| but we're going to talk to the commercial guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13428)|
| 3:43:50| We're going to get guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13430)|
| 3:43:51| We're going to pay attention after COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13431)|
| 3:43:54| what retail needs to go in here, what needs to go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13434)|
| 3:43:56| We're not going to rush into any decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| but we'll focus on the single family and focus on the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13438)|
| 3:44:02| As everything molds together and evolves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13442)|
| 3:44:04| is kind of how we'll take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13444)|
| 3:44:06| but we would like to see us building houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13446)|
| 3:44:09| and the park under construction at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13449)|
| 3:44:15| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13457)|
| 3:44:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13459)|
| 3:44:21| This is not the last item for our night, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13461)|
| 3:44:25| We've got an annual meeting, so just keep everybody informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13465)|
| 3:44:29| We've got still quite a bit ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13469)|
| 3:44:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13472)|
| 3:44:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13473)|
| 3:44:34| I had coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13474)|
| 3:44:35| Didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13475)|
| 3:44:36| Say what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13476)|
| 3:44:37| I said I had coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13477)|
| 3:44:38| Didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13478)|
| 3:44:39| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| Two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13481)|
| 3:44:42| One is about there were comments from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13482)|
| 3:44:45| about a cemetery that's on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13485)|
| 3:44:48| and I wondered if you could speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13488)|
| 3:44:51| if you know at this point, how that would be cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13491)|
| 3:44:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13495)|
| 3:44:57| So right now it's not in the middle of the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13497)|
| 3:45:01| It's about 100 yards north of West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13501)|
| 3:45:05| Right now it's in the middle of the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13505)|
| 3:45:09| No one can get to it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13509)|
| 3:45:10| It's behind our gates that we have for our cattle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13510)|
| 3:45:13| So any improvement we do to it is going to be an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13513)|
| 3:45:16| But Creek Bend Farms is what we're building out of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13516)|
| 3:45:23| It is 192 lots, and it has a cemetery in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13523)|
| 3:45:27| And, again, it just had a road that went by, a grass strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13527)|
| 3:45:30| and when they had a funeral, it was chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13530)|
| 3:45:32| We went in there and improved, widened, gave them parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13532)|
| 3:45:36| relandscaped it, and made it look a heck of a lot better than it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13536)|
| 3:45:40| We have every intention here to respect the cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13540)|
| 3:45:43| give people access, pull off parking, have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13543)|
| 3:45:46| There's no more plots there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13546)|
| 3:45:47| but if someone wants to come visit one of their ancestors, they can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13547)|
| 3:45:51| We're not desensitive at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| And this won't be the first time we've built in Wood Creek next to a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13553)|
| 3:45:57| It's not the first time we're dealing with a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13557)|
| 3:46:00| When you have these large farms like this, yeah, they have cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13560)|
| 3:46:06| It didn't seem like the typical sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13566)|
| 3:46:11| because it wouldn't be an active cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13571)|
| 3:46:14| It's one that is no longer receiving any new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13574)|
| 3:46:18| But people, because of its history, might want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13578)|
| 3:46:21| So I just wanted to make sure it was being thoughtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13581)|
| 3:46:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13584)|
| 3:46:25| The other question I had, in the vein of we don't see a lot of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13585)|
| 3:46:31| so this may be an engineering question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| is because this proposed idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13593)|
| 3:46:39| and you think about the picture that you painted for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13599)|
| 3:46:43| at the end of that picture, the family had had their entire day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13603)|
| 3:46:46| and never gotten in their car to leave the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13606)|
| 3:46:49| So my question is, are traffic studies handled differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13609)|
| 3:46:54| when you've got an encapsulated development like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13614)|
| 3:46:59| as opposed to a development where there are new amenities inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13619)|
| 3:47:02| and they are definitely going to have to get in their car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13622)|
| 3:47:06| Again, engineering might be able to jump in on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13626)|
| 3:47:08| but the traffic studies won't say there's going to be a lot of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13628)|
| 3:47:12| that we're going to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13632)|
| 3:47:13| That's what it's going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13633)|
| 3:47:15| It's probably going to end up with a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13635)|
| 3:47:17| It's going to end up with crosswalks, pedestrian crosswalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| It's going to end up with some widening on some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13639)|
| 3:47:22| We will get that traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13642)|
| 3:47:23| I don't know what I'll tell it, but it is underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13643)|
| 3:47:27| and there's been enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13647)|
| 3:47:30| TDOT has enough studies, from my understanding, to gauge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13650)|
| 3:47:37| So they're going to redo the study, apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| I know there's no school right now, so they'll apply the numbers to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13659)|
| 3:47:43| and we're going to have what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13663)|
| 3:47:46| Again, it's going to end up with a red light, in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13666)|
| 3:47:51| Mr. Sanderson, one of the things I'm looking at is the connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13671)|
| 3:47:58| between the two areas, north and south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13678)|
| 3:48:01| and I think you need to really focus on a good pedestrian accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13681)|
| 3:48:07| I mean, that's a major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13687)|
| 3:48:09| It's going to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13689)|
| 3:48:12| Certainly look at traffic calming features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13692)|
| 3:48:17| Certainly some traffic lights, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13697)|
| 3:48:21| let's dress up those intersections so that someone who's on the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13701)|
| 3:48:27| is going to cross over to the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13707)|
| 3:48:31| You're not taking your life in your hands by doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13711)|
| 3:48:35| Also, was your layout, who prepared the layout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13715)|
| 3:48:40| Is this a landscape architect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13720)|
| 3:48:43| Yeah, they're Gamble & Associates out of Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13723)|
| 3:48:46| They did some stuff for some bigger people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13726)|
| 3:48:49| We reached out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13729)|
| 3:48:50| I think they've had a few in Knox County, but we reached out to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13730)|
| 3:48:53| and they give us – they take the topo, they take all the studies that we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13733)|
| 3:48:59| and morph it into what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13739)|
| 3:49:01| Again, Chairman, yeah, honestly, we hate doing pretty pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13741)|
| 3:49:07| because we'd rather just get the engineers in there, let's get the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13747)|
| 3:49:11| let's get the real black-and-white pictures because we're black-and-white people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13751)|
| 3:49:14| We're doers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13754)|
| 3:49:17| Having that stretch of West Emory, we're going to have to engineer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13757)|
| 3:49:20| There's going to be data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13760)|
| 3:49:21| There's going to be everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13761)|
| 3:49:23| So, again, this pretty picture is going to get layers and layers and layers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13763)|
| 3:49:27| of engineering and numbers and all this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13767)|
| 3:49:30| So, yes, we're completely on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13770)|
| 3:49:32| They're our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13772)|
| 3:49:33| They're our home buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13773)|
| 3:49:34| We don't want them feeling unsafe as they're crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13774)|
| 3:49:37| That's the whole point of having a commercial is walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13777)|
| 3:49:40| We will do sidewalks in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13780)|
| 3:49:41| I know that's not a requirement, but that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13781)|
| 3:49:44| We want – we see it as an amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13784)|
| 3:49:46| We will do sidewalks so people can walk on the sidewalks and get to the commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13786)|
| 3:49:51| get to the park, get where they don't have to get in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13791)|
| 3:49:54| That's the whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13794)|
| 3:49:55| There's going to be no point in not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13795)|
| 3:49:57| I think also, I mean, in terms of your mature vegetation, identify those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13797)|
| 3:50:03| do your best to protect them because they are huge assets for not only the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13803)|
| 3:50:09| but for the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13809)|
| 3:50:12| It looks, right now, from what you see, just a lot of homes, a lot of roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13812)|
| 3:50:17| and I know there's opportunities to maintain and preserve some of the more mature trees in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13817)|
| 3:50:25| It's going to add a lot of character and a lot of value to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13825)|
| 3:50:28| Those are my only two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13828)|
| 3:50:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13829)|
| 3:50:30| The Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13830)|
| 3:50:32| Then we'll go to Commissioner Schelso and Higgins, and then Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13832)|
| 3:50:38| I have a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13838)|
| 3:50:41| What is the timeline for the build-out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13841)|
| 3:50:45| We build 80 homes a year in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13845)|
| 3:50:48| We have been since 1992, so we're looking at a 10-, 12-year project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13848)|
| 3:50:52| You're looking at 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13852)|
| 3:50:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13854)|
| 3:50:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13855)|
| 3:50:56| The other thing, are we looking at sidewalks on both sides of the street there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13856)|
| 3:51:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13862)|
| 3:51:03| The boulevard, I don't know how that's going to be designed because there will be on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13863)|
| 3:51:06| Again, I don't have the exact details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13866)|
| 3:51:08| There will be at least one side of every road with a sidewalk on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13868)|
| 3:51:10| I'm not sure on the exact details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13870)|
| 3:51:13| There will be a sidewalk, at least one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13873)|
| 3:51:15| I don't know about double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13875)|
| 3:51:16| There might be double on the boulevard or something, but, again, I haven't gotten that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13876)|
| 3:51:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13880)|
| 3:51:21| Third, I am really glad to see a company like Smith build a local company going after this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13881)|
| 3:51:31| Yeah, I think that I'd much rather have them than somebody that we don't have any experience with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13891)|
| 3:51:41| and they've always been a good developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13901)|
| 3:51:45| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13905)|
| 3:51:49| Mr. Snowden, is there any plan for West Emory Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13909)|
| 3:51:55| I don't know, any plan, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13915)|
| 3:51:57| There's some spot improvements that TDOT has out there intersection-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13917)|
| 3:52:01| but no what you consider wholesale widening at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13921)|
| 3:52:06| This section of Emory Road, I mean, it's pretty close to Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13926)|
| 3:52:11| So, I mean, have you, I guess, just considered the residents, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13931)|
| 3:52:18| saying that the infrastructure is not there, planning ahead and not just doing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13938)|
| 3:52:24| the minimum turnoff might be, because you don't want to, like, build it all out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13944)|
| 3:52:28| and then ten years later they come in and do four-lane highway through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13948)|
| 3:52:32| and disrupt the whole, everything you just built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13952)|
| 3:52:34| Yeah, so the feedback we get right now is West Emory already has a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13954)|
| 3:52:37| So there is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13957)|
| 3:52:39| When we initially gave this to TDOT, we asked them, first thing, what's the plan for Emory Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13959)|
| 3:52:43| You know what they said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13963)|
| 3:52:44| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13964)|
| 3:52:45| There is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13965)|
| 3:52:46| We have a plan, or we're getting a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13966)|
| 3:52:48| We're meeting with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13968)|
| 3:52:49| They're well aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13969)|
| 3:52:50| We're finally, West Emory is now on their radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13970)|
| 3:52:52| It wasn't going to be without development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13972)|
| 3:52:54| That was going to be my concern, kind of what Mr. Phillips said is basically, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13974)|
| 3:52:58| the pedestrian access and not disrupting that after the development is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13978)|
| 3:53:01| and kind of building it out how it needs to be way into the future and not just right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13981)|
| 3:53:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13986)|
| 3:53:09| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13989)|
| 3:53:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13990)|
| 3:53:13| First of all, like a few others have said, I do want to commend you all for taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=13993)|
| 3:53:20| wanting to try to tackle something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14000)|
| 3:53:23| I've personally spent hours and hours studying this type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14003)|
| 3:53:32| and worked with similar concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14012)|
| 3:53:39| And that being said, I think this is really great for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14019)|
| 3:53:44| You've got a great opportunity for the entire county, and I think that this can be really amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14024)|
| 3:53:49| I do, I have just three simple points of feedback based off what you've shown right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14029)|
| 3:53:57| and this is regardless of whether it's a pretty picture or an engineer drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14037)|
| 3:54:04| So I think there's a conflict of what you all are used to doing and what you're trying to do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14044)|
| 3:54:12| and it's divided by the bottom third with Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14052)|
| 3:54:17| Everything north looks more standard to what you guys are used to doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14057)|
| 3:54:20| and everything below is more progressive and a different way of doing urban design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14060)|
| 3:54:27| And I hate that Emory Road is splitting that and that it's creating this very large divide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14067)|
| 3:54:34| I think that it would be significantly more beneficial for this development for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14074)|
| 3:54:40| if the commercial and the apartments and townhouses had more square footage north of Emory on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14080)|
| 3:54:51| if you could have more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14091)|
| 3:54:55| And that ties into the walkability and the access across Emory Road, because you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14095)|
| 3:55:01| it's going to have more lanes, it's going to have red lights, all of the above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14101)|
| 3:55:06| so that if you can minimize the number of people having to walk across that to get to these amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14106)|
| 3:55:12| then that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14112)|
| 3:55:14| The other aspect of that that I think you all should take another look at with your designers and everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14114)|
| 3:55:22| but the way the streets are laid out, I think in developments like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14122)|
| 3:55:28| when you are pursuing a walkable area and a mixed use, it's almost better to look at towns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14128)|
| 3:55:37| and subdivisions, developments that were done pre-World War II, you know, over 100 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14137)|
| 3:55:44| and look at the grid of streets and the way that things connect in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14144)|
| 3:55:50| And I think that if you all were able to add more of a grid of your streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14150)|
| 3:55:55| I think that would help with the walkability and with just the consistency in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14155)|
| 3:56:02| And then the final thing is you mentioned sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14162)|
| 3:56:07| I think that you all should look not just at sidewalks, but also direct pedestrian paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14167)|
| 3:56:13| because this is, I don't know what the dimension from north to south of this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14173)|
| 3:56:19| but I would say it's very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14179)|
| 3:56:22| And if you look at other, you know, new urbanist communities that will have walking paths throughout them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14182)|
| 3:56:29| that is one of the, if not the most important element of those communities, is that walking paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14189)|
| 3:56:38| And that's what makes them great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14198)|
| 3:56:40| And then the fact that they all connect to the commercial aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14200)|
| 3:56:46| So really I think that you all might want to take a look at moving most of the commercial north of Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14206)|
| 3:56:53| in a way that you can connect everything equally to those amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14213)|
| 3:57:00| And that's neighbors, that's the people in this development, in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14220)|
| 3:57:05| and that's also the people who will drive from far away to come and spend time here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14225)|
| 3:57:11| because, you know, there are a number of developments that are similar to what you all are going for here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14231)|
| 3:57:17| and almost all of them are huge attraction points for the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14237)|
| 3:57:26| So I'm looking forward to see what you all end up finally bringing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14246)|
| 3:57:31| but I do think that maybe looking at blending a new urbanist approach a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14251)|
| 3:57:38| rather than having two distinct urban design ideas split between Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14258)|
| 3:57:46| So those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14266)|
| 3:57:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14267)|
| 3:57:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14268)|
| 3:57:49| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14269)|
| 3:57:50| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14270)|
| 3:57:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14271)|
| 3:57:52| And, you know, just looking at, I know Jim said that there's no, right now nothing on TDOT's list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14272)|
| 3:57:59| but we've got to be thinking about 20 and 30 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14279)|
| 3:58:02| So the one thing that I would recommend, looking at what happened when Emory Road was expanded on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14282)|
| 3:58:11| If you put crosswalks in, it's like a human version of Frogger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14291)|
| 3:58:15| You just hope you don't get run over because of how fast everybody's going and the amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14295)|
| 3:58:20| Eventually, this part of West Emory is going to get expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14300)|
| 3:58:23| So I would even recommend building on what Commissioner Schelso said as well as Chair Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14303)|
| 3:58:28| which is possibly some sort of pedestrian bridge that would connect the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14308)|
| 3:58:33| so that even if TDOT comes in and widens it, it doesn't impede the flow of people being able to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14313)|
| 3:58:39| Because even with the ballparks, you've still got neighborhoods to the left and right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14319)|
| 3:58:42| that are going to want access to those ball fields and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14322)|
| 3:58:45| So it just keeps, especially kids, from crossing Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14325)|
| 3:58:49| Because that section right there, it's straight enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14329)|
| 3:58:51| It might as well be a drag strip because everybody gets up their speed to about 70 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14331)|
| 3:58:56| for a 45-mile-an-hour zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14336)|
| 3:58:59| So just something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14339)|
| 3:59:01| Yeah, so one solution just off the top of my head would be at the traffic light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14341)|
| 3:59:04| you'd have the button that you push to yield and turn red and the pedestrians can walk across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14344)|
| 3:59:08| Very common down in Turkey Creek or something with as much traffic as Turkey Creek has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14348)|
| 3:59:12| or West Time Mall, you push the button, it turns red, and you can walk across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14352)|
| 3:59:16| That's what kind of we envision to keep our pedestrians safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14356)|
| 3:59:22| Commissioner Browning, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14362)|
| 3:59:24| Real quick, I love this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14364)|
| 3:59:27| I mean, I love everything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14367)|
| 3:59:30| Knoxville, Tennessee does not have a housing crisis right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14370)|
| 3:59:35| It has an unhealthy housing market, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14375)|
| 3:59:39| And I think we need to do everything we can do to support the Smith family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14379)|
| 3:59:44| to try to make this thing happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14384)|
| 3:59:46| I'll remind everybody about a development that should have happened four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14386)|
| 3:59:51| over off Tools Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14391)|
| 3:59:53| It was 750 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14393)|
| 3:59:55| It's 750 houses we don't have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14395)|
| 3:59:58| It's a big green field over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14398)|
| 4:00:02| and it's one of the biggest development tragedies that's ever happened in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14402)|
| 4:00:08| So please, let's don't let this be one either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14408)|
| 4:00:11| And I just want to tell everybody we need to get behind this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14411)|
| 4:00:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14415)|
| 4:00:16| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14416)|
| 4:00:17| Well, that concludes our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14417)|
| 4:00:22| Hearing none, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=14422)|
