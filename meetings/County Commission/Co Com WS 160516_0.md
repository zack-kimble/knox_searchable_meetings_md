| 0:00:00| Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow commissioners, welcome to this, the budget input and discussion of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=0)|
| 0:00:15| The agenda for this evening or this afternoon's meeting is set by public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=15)|
| 0:00:25| We will receive input from interested county officials and department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=25)|
| 0:00:35| At this particular point in time, though, I'm searching the crowd. I do not see Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=35)|
| 0:00:44| As a major component of the Knox County budget, Dr. McIntyre, would you like to give us an opening remark to lead us into this budget discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=44)|
| 0:01:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jim McIntyre, 912 South K Street, Superintendent of Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=66)|
| 0:01:11| I do believe I meet your description of an interested official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| I want to talk very briefly about Knox County Schools' budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| The Board of Education has approved and the Mayor has presented to you a $453.5 million general school purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=81)|
| 0:01:33| That is an increase of $15.5 million or about 3.5% on the Knox County Schools' budget for fiscal year 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=93)|
| 0:01:43| We're very excited that revenues are up in a variety of categories to support this considerable increase in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=103)|
| 0:01:53| A lot of which will go toward compensation and salary increases for our teachers and other employees in the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=113)|
| 0:02:03| Our Board of Education has adopted a strategic plan that includes a component of investing in our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| I think this is a budget that does precisely that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| This budget would enable a 3% raise for all certified employees, including classroom teachers in the Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=132)|
| 0:02:20| and a 2.5% raise for all of our classified employees, which would include security officers, custodians, secretaries, and those types of positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=140)|
| 0:02:33| In addition, there's a couple of important items that I think are helpful and remarkable in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| One is that we've partnered with the county to offer to our certified employees, for the first time, workers' compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=161)|
| 0:02:48| That's a program where we've worked with Risk Management and Commissioner Smith to be able to manage that program here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=168)|
| 0:02:59| The county was able to give us a really competitive price in terms of making that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| We're very excited to be able to offer that important benefit to our certified employees for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| In addition, a couple of other investments in this budget that I think are worth highlighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| One is that there's a small amount of money that's set aside for our Disparities in Educational Outcomes Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| That is a community task force really looking at achievement gaps and disproportionalities and discipline in the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| that might be defined by income, race, disability, or language area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| There's a small pool of dollars set aside for that because the recommendations will be forthcoming in the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=215)|
| 0:03:44| We also will invest in this fiscal year 2017 budget, if approved and appropriated by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| over $1 million additional dollars in our student transportation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| A lot of that will go toward additional investments with our school bus contractors to allow them to enhance their own investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=235)|
| 0:04:04| in equipment, in maintenance, and hopefully in driver wages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| and allowing us to make sure that they meet our very exacting and high standards in terms of both service and safety in our transportation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=249)|
| 0:04:19| Finally, I'd note that we have in here an investment in instructional technology that could be the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| in really having a sustainable, long-term, one-to-one instructional technology model in our high schools for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| Again, this is a budget that invests in our people in the Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| allows us to continue to do the great work that's happening in our classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| and will build on much of the success that we've seen over the past few years, moving us toward our goal of excellence for every child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=282)|
| 0:04:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for your brief presentation of the opening comments of the major part of Knox County's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=291)|
| 0:04:59| At this time, I would like to call on the Honorable Mayor of Knox County, Mayor Tim Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| to come and address the overall budget as he has presented around the county over the past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=305)|
| 0:05:17| Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| When they call you honorable, somebody told me an old-timer one time told me that it means they want something, so I'll keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| Dr. McIntyre actually alluded to a little bit of what I was going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| Probably one of the—you've heard me mention more than 62 cents out of every dollar is their portion of our education budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| but it was a pleasure working with them this year through the MOU, and Chris Caldwell and their finance folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| really had, I felt like, a very good conversation about the issues, and we were able to work a lot of things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=348)|
| 0:05:56| Of course, the new schools and the pay raises and the additional spending for paving are all good things, I think, that are in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=356)|
| 0:06:06| And as I had stated earlier, I would have liked to have paid down more debt, but building schools is an important function of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=366)|
| 0:06:17| so we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| And since we've been around talking around the community, the folks that we've talked to, we've been in all, I guess, all y'all's districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| and it's been overwhelmingly in favor of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| And, of course, the mental health thing has been very popular, even though it is a very small portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| although we did—this commission did put in a million dollars in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| I believe it was two years ago, Chris, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| Three years ago, I'm sorry, three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| So I feel like we've done some fairly heavy lifting, Mr. Chairman, and there's not anything hidden in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=407)|
| 0:06:57| and if you have any questions of us, we'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| Are there questions of Mayor Burchett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| Seeing none—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| Dr. McIntyre alluded to only a $15 million increase in the budget this year over last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=440)|
| 0:07:29| but when you look at actual last year versus budget for this year, we're talking $28 million, not $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=449)|
| 0:07:39| So, you know, the devil's in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| You've got to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Plus, when you start adding in just what we have on our agenda for the commission meeting today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=463)|
| 0:07:51| another $31 million of state grants coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| So, you know, that $453,000 by the end of the year and what their expenditures will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=474)|
| 0:08:02| is probably going to be over $500 million and $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| So keep everything in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| It's not just that figure that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| Thank you, Commissioner Brown, for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Doug Battelle, do you mind to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=498)|
| 0:08:28| As you're aware of, Plum Creek Park has been on the chart, off the chart a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| and I'm kind of hoping that this part of this $350,000 in capital on the Parks and Rec is going to ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| is that kind of getting that back on the table, or where are we at with Plum Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| Yes, we're about, hopefully about a month or two away from starting on the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| and we actually used some excess amusement tax money this year to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| and already purchase the playground, picnic shelter, benches, and that sort of thing, so they're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| So, yes, we'll be working on that, and this money will be available to help out on that project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| I think we've got a decent budget to work with now since we were able to move some money from this year into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| so we'll be starting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| How much of the amusement money comes in to you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| How much does the hotel-motel money come into recreation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Is that what you said was coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| Yes, well, there's typically $150,000 on the amusement tax money per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| that we basically use for fixing and repairing the entire park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| Okay, that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| I've got a question for Chris, if Chris doesn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=573)|
| 0:09:50| Chris and I have talked, you know, as we sat down and had the meeting with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| that the things in the budget that concern me or one of the things that concerns me is the pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| The pay increase on the teacher side is 3% and 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| We're giving our employees a step plus a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| And so I asked Chris to kind of tell me what another percent costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| That's a $1.2 million deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| And I think it's hard for us to go back and explain to the general government employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| why one group is getting a raise higher than the other group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| I just want to talk to Chris a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| You know, as we go through midyear or if we come up on budget at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| if there's budget money left over, that we may include that 1% sometime either in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| or just to kind of make it a more fair cross the board from schools and government, general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=638)|
| 0:10:47| Is that something we can kind of discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| You know, what we can do, and the mayor has kind of asked me if I would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| as we close out this year and as revenues start to come in for 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| is watch those and if there's any chance that we may could do a one-time bonus for general county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=660)|
| 0:11:09| we would look for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| And so we'll watch revenues and analyze them in the coming months to see how that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| and see if we can do anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| I think going back to what you and Doug were talking about, there was, I think you had said, hotel and motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| That's actually amusement tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| And so separate tax, the amusement tax, we're starting to phase out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=691)|
| 0:11:42| But that brought in, in 2015, about $239,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| And all that's used for is park improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| And so that money is there for that, just to follow up on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| Okay, thank you. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I just wanted to point out to Commissioner Anders that for the schools, also if they're eligible, it includes a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| Yeah, I mean, some employees in the school system get five and a half if they're eligible for the step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| along with a total of five and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| So it makes it hard to go back to your working constituents and the general government side and explain that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| And I think that we need to make a better effort in the future of doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| or at least being more fair and equitable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| And the school board has a set of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| They can do what they want to with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| And I appreciate that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| But we, on the other hand, have to consider what our general government employees are getting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| Seeing no other Commissioner lights at this particular time, I would return us back to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| Any other interested county officials or department heads that would like to speak at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=772)|
| 0:13:03| Seeing no one approaching the podium, my fellow Commissioners, do you have other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| or discussion of the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| I just wanted to ask Doug Battelle if he has just a minute to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=796)|
| 0:13:27| In your request for equipment, did you include a pickup truck to be used for the parks out in southwest Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=807)|
| 0:13:36| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| And after speaking with you earlier, I've talked to Chris about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| and we can move some money around and make some things work there and still get that truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Chris, looking going forward into the future, how do you see the economy going and this budget playing out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=832)|
| 0:14:11| Let me get on my yacht and I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| You know, I sat through a meeting with Dr. Bill Fox at the TDC board meeting a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=855)|
| 0:14:24| and he gave a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| He said, and I would trust him more than anyone, that he sees steady growth in this region from a total economic standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=868)|
| 0:14:40| And so I would rely on what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| He was saying steady growth of two to three percent, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| Listen, we know that in this budget here, if you look at revenue projections that we have done as of now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=889)|
| 0:15:04| we don't budget for a large revenue growth even in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| But that's okay, and we can grow into that because the growth in the current year has been really good from the standpoint of the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=910)|
| 0:15:24| They're up about, I don't know, five or six million over budget in current year on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=924)|
| 0:15:34| The other two county funds, I would tell you, if not for the correction as it relates to the city, we would break even this year on budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=934)|
| 0:15:46| And we didn't really budget an increase in those two funds for 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| So I think we're very well positioned from the standpoint of growth on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=952)|
| 0:16:01| We budgeted a percent and a half growth on property tax over our projection through the end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=961)|
| 0:16:11| And the growth in the current year has been over a percent and a half in current property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=971)|
| 0:16:22| You've got to remember, I'll always say current property taxes because if you were to break out and look at delinquents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=982)|
| 0:16:30| and what the state refers to as clerk and master, I refer to them as they are delinquent by more than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=990)|
| 0:16:39| Those numbers are a little down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| And the reason being is if you collect over 96% of property tax in year one, the pool for those amounts of delinquents are shrinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1001)|
| 0:16:56| And the low hanging fruit has been gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| And so I think we'll continue to see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| We'll see a point where those kind of level out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| But currently they're going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| So as a whole, we're going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| I mean, I think 2% to 3% would be a good estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| I think our total budget increased by 2.39%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| And so I think we're right in line of what Dr. Fox said in his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| In a couple of budget cycles of school, and I know we have no control of their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| but I know from the MOU that you have some ability to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| We will be taking on two new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| Are any efforts being made to absorb that into the budget beyond natural growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| Because it seems like natural growth gets used every year without being set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| That's always talked about as we plan for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| I think you will see the schools at the end of fiscal year 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| I think you'll see that fund add to their reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| I think their fund balance will increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| And we'll continue to work with them to build that fund balance up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| I think alongside that, we know what the cost is to operate two new schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| and we're very aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| I think as we have historically saw their revenues grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| there will be ways to incorporate the operations of those schools into future budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| And it's never easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| Timing can be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| You hope things continue on, but if they do, it will be pretty seamless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| Do you think we'll at any point be able to project a trend on the sunset from the annexations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| to be able to factor that in, or is it just going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| and we're just going to have to deal with it as it happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| I'm sure you're talking about sunsets on sales tax and the annexations done by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| I think they happen as they happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| They should eventually slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| You've got to look at the time frame when the city did those annexations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| The state told us a year ago that year one would be about a $500,000 hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1164)|
| 0:19:33| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| What's year two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| I don't know how those will sunset out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| We've not really seen a decrease this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| Now, part of that could be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| I say that if you take out the correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| I say that because growth is probably hiding some of that roll-off of the sunset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| and we'll eventually get to a point to where that levels out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1195)|
| 0:20:03| The state's never going to provide a lot of detailed information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| as far as how those numbers where you will actually see them roll off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| You've heard me complain that we couldn't even get a number from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| as it related to the taxing of Amazon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1220)|
| 0:20:28| I said, can you give us a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| We're seeing growth of 7.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| What percentage of that is because we're taxing Amazon sales now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| So I think we probably won't ever know a true number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| because everything we have to do to be flat and that's never going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| Has there been any effort to look at the annexations when they took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| and what parcels they were to see how they may have an effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| We've had a conversation with Jim York in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| He had a list of the time that that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| We can attempt to bag into a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| Our issue has always been this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| When that happens, in the meantime, there will be three, four, five sales tax corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| going on at one time where maybe Fair Gadoes knocks county money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| because something was coded wrong or we're paying the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| and it all is convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| What's interesting, as the state may say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| we're going to take this correction out over three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| So you're trying to plan for those three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| But then you get that third month and you're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| well, if that's being taken out, this is really high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| What's the deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| And you call them and they're like, oh, we decided to do it over two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| Thanks for the heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| And so trying to get a comparison so you can project growth is very, very difficult on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1310)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Commissioner Smith, to comment on your first question that you asked Chris about the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| I just had lunch today with Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| and he told me that the state was running right now $727 million ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| So, Mayor Burchett, maybe it's time for us to go back and get a little bit of that money for our safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| that they're that much ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Also, in talking with Dwight VandeVeit, the building permits and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1350)|
| 0:22:37| they're going sky high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| They can't keep up with them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| So things are booming right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| I don't know just how long they'll last, but right now things are looking pretty rosy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| Again, I ask the question, are there comments from county officials or department heads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1370)|
| 0:23:02| If not, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Mr. Caldwell, do you mind to just recognize your team that helped you with the budget this year so we could recognize them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1388)|
| 0:23:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| We try to keep them hidden because we don't let them out of the office too much, in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| I brought two down with me today, and that's our Comptroller Barry Benchoff and our Budget Manager Jennifer Bodie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1403)|
| 0:23:33| We have a few more that also work on the budget, but we don't let them get away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| They are mainstays, and they have to be locked in a room with me for about two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| and so it's bad for them, but they're back there, and they're kind of hiding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| But they do a great job, and you all should be proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Our condolences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| This meeting on Budget Workshop is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| Regular County Commission work session will start at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1441)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| and welcome to everyone to this, the work session of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1457)|
| 0:24:26| I'm going to do something a little bit different than I've done in any other month opening County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| I need to read from the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| Mabel Acuff passed away Saturday, May 14, 2016, one week after celebrating her 103rd birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1479)|
| 0:24:53| She was a widow of Herbert Acuff, longtime director of central accounting for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1493)|
| 0:25:03| Mabel retired as a teacher from the Knox County school system in 1978 after serving 40 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1503)|
| 0:25:14| Most of those years were spent at Gibbs High School, where she taught English and was later a guidance counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1514)|
| 0:25:23| She was a longtime member of Little Flat Creek Baptist Church, where she faithfully served until a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| as a Sunday school teacher to senior adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| She led a weekly women's Bible study and played the piano as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1536)|
| 0:25:46| Mabel Acuff was my guidance counselor at Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| Herbert Acuff assisted my dad, a World War II veteran, as he got into the business of farming, like 1955 but in subsequent years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1553)|
| 0:26:12| and helping my dad fill out his income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| I'd also like for you to know that Gary Acuff, her son, was a county employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1578)|

| 0:27:04| I know, though, that you're going, or you may be going, where I would prefer to go this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| and that's to the graduation of the Paul Kelly Academy at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| That will be at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1634)|

| 0:27:35| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| I have two announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| First of all, on Wednesday, we're going to do the second monthly Bus Driver Safety Awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| We're going to do those at Ted Russell Ford, who sponsored this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| It's going to be at 11 o'clock on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| We'd love for any of the commissioners, Board of Education to attend, or the public to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| and really recognize the White family for putting the money up to present a $100 check to the five recipients this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1673)|
| 0:28:02| and also a certificate from the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| I talked to one of the bus drivers over the weekend when I told him that he was going to be one of the recipients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| and he said, I drive a bus the same way I'd want the driver of my granddaughter's school to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1691)|
| 0:28:23| She lives in Pennsylvania, and I think about that every day and think about what if I was driving her bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| I thought that was such a great statement that if they all had that attitude, I know many, many of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| So 11 o'clock on Wednesday, if you can come by Ted Russell Ford, we'd love to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| And then on Wednesday night from 5 to 7, Ed and I are going to do our night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| It's going to be in Happy Holler at the Time Warp Tea Room, where I know Amy has had many a meeting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1723)|

| 0:28:58| Commissioners, elected officials, the public, come by with any concerns that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| 5 to 7, Time Warp Tea Room in the Happy Holler area on Wednesday night. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1743)|

| 0:31:07| Mr. Chairman, we'd like to withdraw item number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| We realize after bidding this, it did not require the level of attention we had it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| Item 41, which is resolution 701, is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1878)|

| 0:31:26| We'd like to withdraw item number 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| We're still working on that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| Chris, are you going to have it by next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1893)|
| 0:31:42| Are you going to have it by next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Let's just send that one on without recommendation, and if there's time, we could just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| Are we withdrawn, or are we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| No recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Let's do no recommendation, because we're still working through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| There's no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| And if we get to that point, then we can just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1923)|

| 0:32:34| Do you want to do 50 and 51 without recommendation while we're in this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| Budget and tax rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| They'll be not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| We'll do that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| These are the withdrawals, adds, and defers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Withdrawals, adds, and defers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| 52 is an add, 811.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Are there other adds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| I don't have an add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1974)|

| 0:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| We are now to deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Item 43 is deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Are there any other deferrals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2000)|

| 0:33:36| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| I had a couple items I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| I think Jill's handed out some revised paperwork for you, but item 34, we've got some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| We recently opened a bid and had negotiations with a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| The price of that contract is going to be $2,964,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| That one we will discuss in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| I'm just trying to get the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2037)|

| 0:34:15| Next is to discuss, then, what is on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2055)|

| 0:34:33| Seven, which is resolution 113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2073)|

| 0:34:47| 36, 37, and 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| That is 36, 37, 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| 48, and 49, and 50, and 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| That's 48, 49, 50, and 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| Are there other items that would need discussion today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| Excuse me for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| Item number 56 we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2124)|
| 0:35:33| That needs some explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2133)|
| 0:35:42| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| I see your name with that, so you'd be a perfect person to lead us in that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| Item 56 is not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I was just wondering if Doug could come down and tell us why 41 was being withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| I really didn't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2165)|
| 0:36:17| When we first bid this out, purchasing asked me to go ahead and put a placeholder on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| but realizing now that it will not reach the dollar amount, it will be, gosh, just $12,000 per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| so it wouldn't reach the level to require commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| For a five-year contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Five-year contract, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2193)|

| 0:36:49| Are there other items that my fellow commissioners would wish to discuss today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2209)|
| 0:36:57| Seeing no lights, do I have a motion that the consent agenda be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2221)|

| 0:37:12| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2232)|

| 0:37:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2236)|

| 0:37:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| The first item is listed on page two, item number seven, resolution 113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| It's appointing a citizen member with financial management experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| and reappointing Kim Garvin, citizen member with benefits administration experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| to the Knox County Health Insurance Appeal Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| Mr. Mark Jones, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| Mark Jones, 400 Main Street, room 345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| If it's okay, I'd like to submit the name of Carissa Dunaway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| for the financial management experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| She's with USI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| And since this is a blank before us as we read it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| and we need to have time for consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| I'd move that this be forwarded, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| Seeing no further discussion, the name is added to the blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2312)|
| 0:38:45| The next item is listed on page nine, item number 34, resolution 405,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| but I have the amended caption that fills in the blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| It is a resolution approving a construction contract in the amount of $2,964,555.26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2334)|
| 0:39:04| with Charles Blaylock and Sons Incorporated for the construction of the Ebenezer Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| and Gleason Drive intersection improvements project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Since this is also a motion that's before us today with blanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| but with the blanks filled in, I would move no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| Mr. Stone appears to be calm with that no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| The next item is on page 10, item number 36, resolution 405,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| and I have the amended version or the version that gives the amount in the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| It's approving a proposal from C.D.M. Smith in the amount of $708,540| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| to provide survey and civil design services for the Canton Hollow Road improvements project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| This resolution coming before us with a blank, which has now been filled in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| I move that it be forwarded no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| Mr. Snowden, fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Item number 37, resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| It's adopting the Knox County Code Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| and Inspection Department Schedule of Fees, effective July 1, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| I hear a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Mr. Vandevee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| This is one of two items, and this is probably the one that's of somewhat less interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| This is just a standard schedule of fees, much of which centers on miscellaneous permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| like mobile homes, signs, demolition permits, and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| Board of Construction appeals, Board of Zoning appeals, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| We have a series of incidental changes here that I don't think are of much interest to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| but we did want to present them to Commission for ratification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2481)|
| 0:41:29| Are there questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Dwight, I spoke with you about this this morning, and since then I've had a couple of conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| and not with any commissioner, but you alluded to the fact that we're still, even with this increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2506)|
| 0:41:55| far below the city and also the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| And what you talked about was maybe coming back in on a couple of years or so and raising again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| Would we be better off to go ahead and set that higher figure now with steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2529)|
| 0:42:19| or do we need to better look at it in a couple of years and see where we're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| Commissioner Brown, I really think that's probably the discretion of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| That's actually going to be more addressed in Item 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| We'll get into that rather extensively in the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| This only incidentally will affect that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| so you can pass this without any concern about the larger implications that it might have for building permit fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| because the next item is the one that will substantively make a difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| So I will tell you that there's not anything here that should concern you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| in terms of that larger discussion about building permit fees, and that's in the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| Sort of piggybacking on that particular question, the schedule of fees that's being adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| is this something that is coming out of research that is recommended for our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2589)|
| 0:43:17| or is this a fee schedule that you all have developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| This is essentially an update to an existing fee schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Virtually everything you see on here is already here, and a number of fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| we probably should have broken this out in a little more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| actually a number of the fees on here aren't going up at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| A couple have been cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| For instance, we had on demolition permits, we had a distinction between one and two-story residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| We've consolidated that to a single $50 fee, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| So this schedule, as you see before you, it exists already and has for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| Board of Zoning Appeals is a $200 fee to file a Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| It has been for as long as I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| So most of these are either cleaning up the verbiage a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| or in one case, like in the top section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| there's a section where it was based on a $2.90 per additional square foot of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| We rounded that to $3 because it makes it easier for the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| and for the IT folks that program these things to manage those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| So, again, pretty much incidental stuff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| The substantive discussion is really, again, more on Item 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| Seeing no further discussion, the motion that is properly before us is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Item number 38, Resolution 409,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| is adopting the most recently published version of the International Code Council's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| regionally adjusted building valuation data report, currently dated August 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| Thereafter, the current version is published by the International Code Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| for use by the Knox County Code Administration and Inspection Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| with the May construction cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| I make a motion we move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| I'll go to Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2717)|
| 0:45:24| I didn't know if Commissioner Brown had gotten all his questions asked from the previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| If we're going to move it on, we're going to have to rehash it again on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Well, my question is, Dwight, assuming that this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| do we have a communications plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| This is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| I mean, this is going to get into the builder's pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| You know, good little clip, which is, you know, I see the justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| We can talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| But, you know, it will be a shock to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| Is there kind of a communications plan that you have to get the word out that these are coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| It may not be as robust as I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Ashley Burnett from the Home Builders Association is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| and he and I have been in discussion regarding this over the past couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| But for something this consequential, I would say in all fairness to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| he may not regard it as as much notice as he would like, and I wouldn't take issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| I should mention I actually won't be here next week, but Roy Braden would be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| and he'd be prepared to speak to this in some detail as questions come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| I do want to confirm that all of you have, there's about four or five pages of material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| starting with I-Code building valuation data tables and some of the charts and analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| Be glad to answer any questions or speak to that if you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| or if we want to defer the matter to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| And, again, Mr. Burnett from the Home Builders Association is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| and I'd certainly want him to have a chance to speak to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Well, you know, I guess since you're not going to be here, I'll ask another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| This may be a perception, may be real, but as I look at the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| the assumption is they have a lot more rigor and there's a lot more detail to their, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| I know we've upped our storm permit in terms of a lot more congestion, easements, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| that may not be as heavy in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| So my question is, with this margin, and I understand, you know, studies across, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| the country and the region, but there's probably reasons for that higher amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| What's the reason, not just to get like everyone else or to get more on par with everyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| but what's the true reason for this increase in budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| I mean, this should be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Candidly, a lack of legislative will in 2007, just to be perfectly blunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| This is a 1994 standard we have in place, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| It is 22 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| I will tell you that the quality of building inspection and the nature of the building inspection that we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| is fully commensurate with any that the city of Knoxville or the town of Farragut provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| Remember, Commission, this is about the structural side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| This is about the four corners of the house up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| So stormwater requirements, drainage requirements, stormwater pollution prevention plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| and things like that are entirely unrelated to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| This focus is exclusively on the house that your constituents live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| Mr. Braden brought this to Commission in 2007, actually before the bottom fell out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| There was a lot of resistance to it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Since that time, the bottom fell out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Obviously, we didn't think it was appropriate to bring this back to Commission prior to the homebuilders recovering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2928)|
| 0:48:57| But I'm here today to tell you that we permitted 122 single-family homes last month alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| The city of Knoxville permits between 10 and 12 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| I'll repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| The city of Knoxville permits between 10 and 12 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| We permitted 122 single-family homes in the month of April 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| In terms of value, we see activity all across the spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| from a robust volume of entry-level homes to a lot that recently sold off of North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2960)|
| 0:49:29| a single-family residential lot that sold in Knox County, Tennessee, for $1,750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| Now, I'll grant you it's a nice lot and it's on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| But in that subdivision, there have been three lots that have sold already, lots in the seven-figure range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| And I guess that, to be perfectly blunt, it gets my dander up a little bit, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| because I'm really proud of the work that these folks do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| And I would tell you that the quality of inspection and the detail of inspection that they provide is commensurate with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| It is commensurate with the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| We are all active in the East Tennessee Building Officials Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| And the important point, we are all observing the same body of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| This commission adopted the International Code Council's International Residential Code in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| That is the body of standards that we observe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| That's the body of standards that people have to submit plans to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| And that's the body of standards that we inspect to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| Probably, if I had it to do over at that time when we adopted the codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| we would have come to you with a fee increase then as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Because you've already blessed the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| You've said this is what we want to see housing in Knox County look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| We didn't raise the question of fees at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| And if I had it to do over again, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Because the more time that goes by, the harder that conversation becomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| And I will tell you that we own a good share of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| The longer we let the discussion go on and the wider the gap becomes, the harder it is to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| And I understand Dan are getting up, but I guess you still haven't answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| The margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| What is the money going towards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Are you hiring more people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| I mean, as you say, are you expecting the number, if you're doing it with the current staff, 122 last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| are you expecting the number to go up to 200?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Again, I'm just trying to understand what the margin is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| Let me call to your attention, and this is good language that's in the I-Codes table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| I've actually got it highlighted for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| The building valuation, the intended purpose is to help establish permit fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| so as to fund code compliance activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| That's the first line that I've got highlighted on the top page of your handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| The whole point of this, Commissioner, is we're not in the money-making business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| Our hope is that we will have permit fees that are set such that we break even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| so that when a building inspector goes out and he completes the four to six inspections on a single-family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| the cost of those inspections stays with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| Otherwise, the cost of those inspections is borne by your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| and Commissioner Boyle's constituents and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| So my point to you is that our operating cost in code administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| is significantly less than our revenue from permit fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| That's already the case now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| So what happens is general fund appropriation makes up that difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| That's a policy decision for this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| I mean, it may be okay, and if you guys are okay with it, I am too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| But the model and the standard acceptance in the industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| is that permit fees come as close as possible to offsetting operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| And that's the point of having this conversation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| So I should expect a decrease in our operating costs as these go up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| I'll defer to Commissioner, excuse me, to Mr. Caldwell on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| But if our revenues go up, I would think our general fund appropriation would go down commensurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3161)|
| 0:52:50| You know, Chris, I didn't see you over there, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| So how do we track these takes and puts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| So as these funds increase and as it gets more to wholly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| I think what I heard Dwight say that operational costs were partially funding these permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| So as we get these monies in directly from the builders, how does that work with subsequent budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3194)|
| 0:53:22| Keep in mind that the codes administration budget is within the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| So it really won't have an impact on the general fund as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| The expenditure piece of codes administration is their budget for FY17 is $1,622,972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3213)|
| 0:53:44| So going to what Dwight is saying, trying to break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| We would, in this proposed budget, includes the passing of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3229)|
| 0:54:01| And that would raise our revenue estimates from one point, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| from an actual amount of 1.1 in 2015 to a proposed number of 1.5 million in 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3247)|
| 0:54:16| So you're close to breaking even then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| As you stand right now, you're not really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| I mean, there's a wide gap there of about $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| So all you're trying to get to from a revenue and expenditure standpoint is, as the code states, to break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3267)|
| 0:54:37| Not to make any money, but to break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| And even with the passage of this, we may not even break even, but it closes the gap tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3280)|
| 0:54:51| I'll leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Mayor Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| And, Dwight, you made the statement that a little bit uncomfortable about the implementation and the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3295)|
| 0:55:06| I know it's a budgetary issue with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| So what would, say, next week if we pass this but not make it effective July the 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| so we can get everything implemented and they can get comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| maybe if we made it August the 1st or September the 1st, I know it has a slight budget implication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| but it's not that drastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| I certainly work comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| And what I haven't touched on yet, but this is as good a time as any, is when we looked at the numbers last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| and I spent a lot of time this weekend thinking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| our dilemma is we are so far behind that I think there's a fairness issue in trying to go from 1994 to 2015 all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3338)|
| 0:55:47| and expecting the trades to absorb it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| So we actually would propose to go to 85% of the current published I-Code building valuation data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3350)|
| 0:55:59| and then potentially go to 100% maybe in FY18 because it's a pretty big leap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| The problem is the longer we kick this can down the road, the wider and wider and wider the gap becomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| So if we could take some action, whether it's 85%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| whether it's deferring it until slightly later in the fiscal year, we'd be fine with any of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| But you will reach the point where the gap is going to become so large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| As you look through those examples, you'll reach the point where the gap becomes so large we'll simply never close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Dwight, I believe Commissioner Brown said that this was still going to leave us significantly below the city of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| I thought this was going to pull us right along with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| When we looked at it again, we went back through the numbers and met with Chevelle Lewis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| and Randy Lilly and Debbie Tibbs have done yeoman's work for me on this and I should mention that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| We will still be significantly below the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| Our permit fee is inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| When you permit the house, the only two things that are not included are a plans review fee and $25 for technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| That's the same across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| But for the city, for instance, depending on the number of plumbing fixtures you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| and the number of gas taps you have, for instance, there are add-ons that are not reflected necessarily in the base permit fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3443)|
| 0:57:31| So looking, for instance, we picked a 2,500 square foot home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| That's about as close to average as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| As you can see, those are pretty substantial disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| The city and the town of Farragut, those are their fees, including gas taps, plumbing fixtures, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3462)|
| 0:57:51| Our base permit fee would include those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| So it's very difficult to give you an apples-to-apples comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| but the bottom line is I don't know that we'll ever be commensurate with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| That isn't necessarily my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| My goal, again, is coming back to what the I-Codes that this commission adopted provide for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| It is to get as close to self-sufficiency as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| It is, Commissioner McKenzie, a subsidy to the construction trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| You've been pretty outspoken about the pilots and TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| I hope you view this through the same lens because that is, in effect, what this is, is a subsidy to the construction trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| I'm not averse to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| This commission's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| I just want to make sure we all are singing off the same page in the hymnal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| When you talk about the inspections that the city does versus the inspections that the county does and the add-ons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| what are the different elements that the county does not inspect for that the city does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| The only thing that the county does not inspect that the city does is electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| All the same other aspects, whether it's plumbing, whether it's gas, whether it's mechanical, we do them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| But if you come in and you get your building permit, we don't care if you have one gas tap or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| The fee is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| The city does charge an additional fee for each gas fixture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| So if you have a gas dryer, a gas range, a gas water heater, there's an additional charge for each of those connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| In our case, you just get your fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| We inspect every gas fixture in that house, sign off on it when it's appropriate, and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| Same thing with plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| It doesn't matter, frankly, if you have one-and-a-half baths or ten-and-a-half baths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| When you get your permit, it's based on square footage and the price of your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| So if you can have as many bathrooms as you want, we'll inspect it, and there's no additional fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| What does the state charge for the electrical inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| I don't recall, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| It's been so long since I've had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| I'll be glad to find out, and Roy can tell you on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| but I don't actually know what the state charges for electrical anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| You spoke about a phase-in, and something I worry about is a lot of developers and builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| already have plans in place, financing in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| When you throw something like this in, it can put a little bit of a curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| and I know you worry about us being so far behind, but we are going to make an effort here to get caught up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| Is there any way we could phase this in over a year, maybe every three months, go up a percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| Because I'm a bit worried that what you might have is a bunch of builders show up on your door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| the day before this goes into effect and pull 50 permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| I don't want to complicate things for Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| but likewise I should say that I wouldn't want to complicate things for IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| And I'm not averse to that at all, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| I guess my only thought would be if we could do it on something like an annual increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| And again, these are policy decisions that are the will of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| But if we could do it on annual increments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| there is an awful lot of coding that goes into the operating system that establishes these fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| and generates the permit calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| And I don't know if Mr. Moran is still here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| but his head would spin around at the idea of doing this every 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| So if we do a phased approach, and we're not opposed to that at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| if we could do it on an annual basis, I think it would certainly help IT as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| So in the budget that's before us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| the general portion to cover your expenses that aren't covered by fees has already been allocated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| To the best of my knowledge, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Now, Chris has run our revenue projections up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| The numbers you see are going to be, just because these things always vary a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| they may vary some from what Chris has in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| And his will be a larger number that will include commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| We haven't really touched on commercial because it's just a much simpler universe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| And our volume of commercial is much smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| Interestingly, we're probably 70% residential, 80% residential, and the balance commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| The city is exactly the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| They are preponderance commercial and a small increment of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| Have you spoken with Mr. Moran about what possible type phase-in would be acceptable and easy to implement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| I would like to do so, but I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Mr. Vandiver, a quick question for you, and I'm looking at the chart here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| What is the average square footage of these houses that are being built, you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| or the permits that you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| You know, I don't know if we've ever sat down and looked at our total volume over the course of a year and averaged it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| One thing we did give you, and this might help, is a table of actual houses that we permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3750)|
| 1:02:38| And I believe that is going to be the second page in our handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| The reason we selected these is these are actual houses that came through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| So you can see on this page the square footage on the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| the valuation that we got using the 1994 standards and the current fee that that results in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| and then our proposal to go to 85%, the valuation that that creates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| And obviously I should just point out that a 1,248-square-foot house in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| costs way more than $62,400 to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Obviously the figure of 119 is much more accurate and much more current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| So at 85%, that's the value it gives you, and at 85%, that's the permit fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| And then you can see at 100 where it puts the value and where it puts the permit fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| And across the board, but particularly at the lower end, we felt the permit fee increase at 100% was pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| On a 3,400-square-foot home, a 4,000, 5,000-square-foot home, these things aren't as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| although the numbers are bigger, the implications aren't as great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| But on the smaller homes, the implications are pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| Just looking at this chart, I was trying to figure out if one of these is the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| So none of these are really the average that we know of, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Okay, and from looking at the permits that come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| do you have any idea if houses are getting bigger or smaller or staying about the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| I do not, but the lady who does is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| Debbie Tibbs is our supervising permit technician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| I'll ask her if she's got a feel for whether or not house size is going up, down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3853)|
| 1:04:25| She tells me we're doing a lot more of the big houses because volumes are up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| and the industry is strong at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| Just one quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| These fees are passed to the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| This is not costing the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| This is part of the cost of building your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| You pay your own fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| So it's not hurting the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Hey, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| I'm looking at the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| I'm seeing example one and example two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| This is the red and the blue sheet you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| The 85 and 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| Yes, sir, and I'm hoping that hasn't been updated since the agenda was put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| Well, I just got this today on my desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Okay, that's current then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| I'm looking at the resolution, though, and the resolution doesn't say the 85 or the 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| What did we budget for in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| A hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| A hundred starting July the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Dwight, if we went forward with these new fees and you had a surplus in your department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| would you be able to use those funds to, say, pave additional roads and subdivisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Those revenues don't come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| They go to Mr. Caldwell and to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| So we'll operate on our budget within the limits of that, and that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| Mr. Chairman, if I could, just before you cast the vote, I just wanted to point this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| It's probably going to seem a little counterintuitive to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| but at the very back of this packet that all of you have is an article from the Wall Street Journal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| It was sent to me by a developer who's a personal friend, and I got it last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| and I read it the day he sent it to me, and I have read it twice since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| And I would want this commission to know this resonates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| and this is an evaluation of the cost of regulation as it factors into the price of a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4003)|
| 1:06:51| I will tell you that I don't think we have the impact that you see here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| because we don't have a lot of the sort of impact fees and things like that that you see cited in the article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| But I would want you to know that we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| So we don't enter this discussion lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| We understand what the implications are for the construction trades of any additional fee increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4028)|
| 1:07:16| or any additional set of regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| But again, we felt like we needed to just open this up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| 1994 was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| Again, I will tell you qualitatively, we have master code officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| We have well-trained, very skilled building inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| They represent you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| So the quality of work that they provide, the volume of work that they provide is absolutely commensurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| and I would stake it against any other jurisdiction in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| But we don't enter this discussion lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| This is the sort of thing we take seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| and what we want is people to have a safe, properly constructed home and no other outcome than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4072)|
| 1:08:01| Motion is properly before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| Before you vote, just a heads-up on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| and this is a conversation that had taken place when the White and I spoke to the mayor and Dean Rice about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4089)|
| 1:08:19| About any amount that comes in over the budgeted amount on these permit fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4099)|
| 1:08:26| I think the mayor would like to transfer that into paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| It kind of goes along with what Commissioner Schoonmaker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| But I told the mayor that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| We just have to take that revenue, estimate and appropriate it, and transfer it to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| The White's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| It's in two different pots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| But we could, anything that was over the budgeted revenue number, we can move it to paving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| and the mayor would like us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| And so I wanted you to have that information before you voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4138)|

| 1:12:17| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Page 15, item number 56, resolution 904,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| is adopting rules of procedure for the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| Got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| I need to give you a little bit of a background first on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| We have right now, pending before the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| a case that's been hanging for over a year, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| with May 15, I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| which it's a humdinger, let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| There are 19 charges against this one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| One of the individuals has about 12 different aliases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| but we don't have anything right now that defines exactly what the Ethics Committee can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4395)|
| 1:13:24| and can't do in a case like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| Did you all get the Knox County Ethics Committee rules of procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| Did everybody get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Or does that just go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| No, we didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| It should be attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| It's attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| Has everybody read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| If you haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| the biggest thing in here that will protect us from this is what we want to do at the next Ethics Committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4428)|
| 1:13:56| is to stay this thing permanently until the lawsuit has been adjudicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4436)|
| 1:14:04| Because right now all we're doing is giving the lawyers free discovery on a bunch of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4444)|
| 1:14:14| in order to draw this out against Knox County for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| But if you look under Rule 3, Number D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| it says if during the pendency of the proceedings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| the complainant becomes a part to either a civil or criminal proceeding involving the same subject matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| then there should be no further action by the Ethics Committee until a final determination by a judicial tribunal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| So that would be the first order of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| If we adopt these rules, what we've had before has been kind of loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| But this gives us some rules to operate by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| Cut and dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| And that will be the first order of business in the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| But I would strongly encourage you to adopt these rules so that we can have some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| Because the Ethics Committee, it has to serve as a judge and a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4511)|
| 1:15:20| And when you don't have all of the apples in your basket to see what's in there, it's hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4520)|
| 1:15:31| This thing is so ambiguous at this point, who knows what the vote would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4531)|
| 1:15:38| But again, the Ethics Committee vote has to be just like a jury vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| It must be unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| So this gives us a clear-cut way of not getting out of this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| but staying it until we can legally do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Does this come back on that animal control complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Mr. Law Director, if we adopt these, will these rules retro back to this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| I mean, is it going to be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Well, this case is still pending before they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| I know, but it's already started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| So that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Well, they haven't heard the case yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| There's motions before it which will be heard in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| I think they need some procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| Truly, the board doesn't have procedures to follow that are going to protect Knox County even more than this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4587)|
| 1:16:35| in terms of due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Currently, the Supreme Court is a person's name is a constitutional right, the protection thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4598)|
| 1:16:47| And this will provide the board process even if they went forward, even if they could go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| So this is to clean up and give them a road map to work from then and going forward now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| I think that this body, since they don't have rules effective at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| you created the body, you can put rules into place for them to operate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| I just want to make sure you felt comfortable defending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| I needed to let you all know this is the last week of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| and the kids have something important going on every day this week and every evening this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| So I apologize for coming in late, and I'm going to have to leave early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| But it's the last week of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| Seeing no further discussion, Commissioner Brown, this is your item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| Just to reiterate, and really in answer to Mr. Andrews' question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| we've talked about this for the last four or five meetings, but we've never started digging into it officially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4669)|
| 1:17:59| It's to say we're wasting time, and time is money, and we're wasting the county's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4679)|
| 1:18:11| Commissioner, have we got a motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4691)|

| 1:19:39| You can't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| I was showing the picture around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| You all remember my sister-in-law was in labor at last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| After 48 hours of labor, my nephew was born, 8 pounds, 12 ounces, and I named him David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4786)|
| 1:19:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| Thank you, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4800)|

| 1:20:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| I wanted to bring something to everybody's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| This week, Knoxville and Knox County is hosting the Women in Municipal Government Convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| It starts on Wednesday afternoon and goes through Thursday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| And Knox County helped to sponsor this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| And we have two outstanding county employees who are going to be attending the event this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| And they happen to be in the audience with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| And I wish they'd just come down front and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| We have Karen Smitherman with the Purchasing Department and Cindy Pionke with Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| So they're going to be our county employees represented at the Women in Municipal Government Convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4842)|
| 1:20:50| And Dot LaMarche, who is the Vice Mayor of the Town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| is the President of the National League of Cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| And she's the one that was actually the one that got Knoxville and Knox County to host this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| So I'd just like to recognize those and give them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4869)|
| 1:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| Way to go, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4879)|

| 1:22:54| Your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| My name officially, Andrew R. Adsema, 5612 Sierra Road in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4977)|
| 1:23:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| Commission members, thank you for your time and consideration on the budget that's before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| My name is Andy Adsema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| I'm the music teacher at Inskip Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| I've been teaching at Inskip for 17 years now, and I can say that even though I live about a quarter of a mile outside of the school zone, I am truly a member of the Inskip community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=4997)|
| 1:23:28| Before I start, I would like to publicly thank Dr. McIntyre for his service to Knox County and wish him luck in his future at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5008)|
| 1:23:37| and also say that I hope for continued cooperation between the mayor and the future leaders of Knox County Schools, leading to even continued improvement in the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5017)|
| 1:23:49| Tonight, I'd like to specifically speak about the capital improvement plan for Knox County Schools that's part of your overall budget tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| At the school board meeting about a month ago, there was a very lively discussion regarding this plan, especially specifically about the addition and renovation at my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5037)|
| 1:24:07| Perhaps some of you have heard things that I would classify as perhaps mythical rather than factual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5047)|
| 1:24:14| so I wanted to speak in order that you might find some truth among the many things that you may have heard about the addition of Inskip to the capital plan a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5054)|
| 1:24:23| When I was hired in 1999 and I saw Inskip Elementary for the first time, it was not a highly impressive building on the outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5063)|
| 1:24:32| but I quickly learned that on the inside it was a great school with great teachers and great administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| I remember sitting in staff meetings in the late winter, early spring, and we would get a paper copy of the capital plan from Dr. Lindsay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5079)|
| 1:24:47| and I would always look at it since it was right there in my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| I was encouraged by the fact that Inskip was on the three to five year plan for some additions or renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| Well, three to five or four to six or five to seven years passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| and Inskip never got moved into that coveted one to two year spot on the capital plan that meant you really were probably going to get something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5103)|
| 1:25:11| In fact, some of those years we didn't even show up on the three to five year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| Then the superintendent changed and communication has taken a huge leap forward since the early 2000s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5116)|
| 1:25:23| and now all the information you want is available at your fingertips if you go to the right websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| But since I haven't been handed a copy of the capital plan, I will admit that I honestly have not looked at one for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5129)|
| 1:25:37| so I don't know if Inskip has been on any recent capital plans or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| What I do know is that over the last 17 years, the needs of our growing school were met with the addition of portables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5142)|
| 1:25:50| and more portables, and more portables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| Ten portable classrooms added in the last 17 years since I've been there, in addition to the ones that were already there when I arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5154)|
| 1:26:02| We've reached the point now that nearly 40 percent of our regular education classrooms are learning in a portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| I was really surprised in the school board meeting to hear some statistic that apparently says that Inskip is under capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| and could actually handle an even greater enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| If I heard this wrong, then please forgive me, but if I did not hear that wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| then the person that did that enrollment study has obviously never stepped foot in our school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| because I have no idea where we would put an increased enrollment in our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| The needs of our school have been widely reported, and they are comparable to other schools in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| so I won't dwell on those facts tonight other than to say that if you haven't seen the needs of our school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| I encourage you to come look with your own eyes, and I would even gladly give you a personal tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| Another thing in the school board meeting that struck me the wrong way was the characterization that somehow Inskip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| had somehow cut in line ahead of other schools that were on the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| As I said, I haven't looked at the plan in recent years, so I don't know if we cut in line or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| But I do know this. Inskip has been in line for a really long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| And if my math is correct, 17 years is a lot longer than the 3 to 5 years that was originally mentioned in Dr. Lindsay's capital plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5230)|
| 1:27:19| In closing, I'd like to say I know there are real needs at many other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| I just heard from one of my other fellow Knox County music teachers that, like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| she's going to be on a cart for at least a portion or maybe all of next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| until a portable classroom can be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| But I agree with the opinion that many of the school board members voiced at the meeting a month ago, and that was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| We can argue all night about whose needs are greater, but we must do something now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| And Inskip's time is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| So unless you have any questions for me, I will close in saying thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Yes, Mr. Adzima.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| I just wanted to say thanks for coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| First of all, teachers like you really make a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| You came from your school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| You've been there 17 years, and you came down here to speak up for your school, and I admire that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| And I think we all appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| It's important to hear things like you're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| I just wanted to say thank you for being here because we do hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker, do you have a question for the petitioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| You said you could not find the capital plan on the school website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| I'm not saying I couldn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| I'm just saying since it wasn't really handed to me, I wasn't looking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Because I don't think it's posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| The capital plan is posted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| Summaries are usually posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| Maybe not the details, but usually a summary of the capital plan would get posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| probably similar to the way that it was passed out in a hard copy years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| Thank you, Mr. Adzima.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| Are there others wishing to speak at this public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| Are there others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5362)|
| 1:29:38| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| My name is Kendall Aaron, and my address is 6531 Dean Hill Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5381)|
| 1:29:50| I'm actually speaking on behalf of East Tennessee Children's Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| and specifically the Childhood Obesity Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| Basically, on behalf of the coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| we would like to express our gratitude toward the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| specifically for including the funding that is included in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5407)|
| 1:30:17| which will enhance sidewalks that are specific to safety improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| around school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| We just wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| and to you all for supporting those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| Seeing no further discussion, thank you, Ms. Aaron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| Are there others wishing to speak at this public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5444)|
| 1:30:59| Name and address for the record, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| Blaine Sample, 5214 Pellahatchie Way, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5461)|
| 1:31:11| My name is Blaine Sample, and I did not have a speech prepared at all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| I did not expect to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| but I just wanted to reiterate what Mr. Azima had said and support his statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| I am the coordinator for the community schools program at Inskipp Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| I work for the university-assisted community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| and Inskipp was declared a community school this past school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| With that being said, there is an extended day that goes on in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| and there is additional programming that goes on in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| As he has stated, there is not enough room in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| to make these things happen at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| For example, we have a theater club that would love to give a performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| but we cannot even use the stage to do so because the stage is being used for storage room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| as you can tell if you ever come in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| So I just want to take a quick second to just reiterate everything that Mr. Azima has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| and support his statements and give my support to what is going on at Inskipp and the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5523)|
| 1:32:13| Seeing no discussion, thank you, Ms. Stiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| Are there others wishing to address this public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| Are there others wishing to address this public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| Seeing none, I remind my fellow commissioners that we'll meet in regular session next Monday, May 23rd, 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5550)|
| 1:32:41| Commissioner Smith, did you wish to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| I know that next Monday is the opening of the Clayton Park that is scheduled at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| I'd like to remind everybody that we do have beer board at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| We need at least five people to meet me back here because these people are counting on being able to get their license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| and we don't want to delay them a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| Right, and the audit committee meets at 1.30 next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| Yeah, we've already spoken with the mayor about that, and Michael is taking care of that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5595)|
| 1:33:23| Yeah, commissioners, I just want to take an opportunity to apologize for the tightness of that schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| but it was really the only time that Mr. Jim Clayton and the mayor both could find on their schedules to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5607)|
| 1:33:34| So if you're not able to make it, we certainly understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| We'd love to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| Seeing none, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160516?start=5622)|
