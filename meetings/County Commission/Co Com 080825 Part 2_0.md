| 0:02:07| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| On page 30, the bottom two, the fuller group, 4D-07SP and 4F-07RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=133)|
| 0:02:21| we would request that those be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=141)|
| 0:02:33| Somebody want to take the next eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| What did he say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Take the next eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| Those were the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| I thought you had about two or three more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| You just wishful thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| The bottom two, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| But what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Does everyone get the light on, Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| I've had a request from some members of the audience asking that if we could not go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| and hear item 915, although we are in zoning, they have been waiting a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| and if we could hear that, I think it might be a short discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| Let's hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| We're going to do something we haven't ever done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| We can always try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| You're talking about before zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Before zoning, so that they can go ahead and head on home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| They've been here since at least 2 o'clock waiting for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Well, it's up to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| 915?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| 915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| 915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| It's the next one after zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| You know, whatever this body wishes to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| Pleasure of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=228)|

| 0:03:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Well, you know, to be honest, yeah, I think Commissioner Moore had an interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| Where's Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| Hey, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| I'm fine with Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| He's out in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| He needs to be in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| This is his amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Y'all request has been granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| So if you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| We're going to go to 915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Y'all trying to trick me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| We almost got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| We're going to 915 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| Because we had no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| Read it to the record clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| requesting the Development Corporation of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| to sell by public auction the Midway Road property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| which was the site for the proposed Midway Road Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=288)|

| 0:04:55| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| I'd make a motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| Make a substitute motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Second on the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Well, I guess we need a second on the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| We didn't get a second on the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| I'll second the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Substitute motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Mr. Pinkston, you were the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Your life's on, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Just won't take no more time because I believe the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| already got his mind made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| And is there anybody here in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| I mean, it would be in favor of getting rid of Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| Of selling Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| You're in favor of keeping it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Todd, can you tell us where we're at and what the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| If Chancellor Fensler has issued the ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| And what what is the timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Because if you go back and look at the tape, as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| I think you all have told us when you wanted to get this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| for an industrial park that it was for jobs in the next few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| So I'd like the clarification of what a few years is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Is it two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| On the fans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Chancellor Fensler's ruling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| My understanding was filed last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Toward the end of last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Maybe Thursday or Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| I got a copy of it on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Are you all going to appeal it or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Our board has given us the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| We have not done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| But we may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| What kind of timeline do you or do you know if you decide to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| appeal it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| What what time frame do you think you'd get into a court and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| get a decision one way or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Perhaps Law Director Owings could speak to that better than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| Let me see if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| What was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| If they if they file an appeal to get it to a different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| Court to appeal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| What's the time frame getting that done and getting through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| some kind of court action and getting a decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Takes a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| I mean I thought this would come up in zoning and I knew we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| were going to talk about it then for certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| But we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Meetings with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| I've had a conversation with the Development Corporations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Council and no decisions have been made at this point to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| appeal the chancellor's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| It came down last Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| I guess it was Wednesday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| We didn't get a copy until Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| We get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| Orders through the mail just like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| Even though we're only about four or five floors up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| We get orders through the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| We get orders through the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| We get orders through the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| We get orders through the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| We get orders through the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| We get orders through the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| And so we haven't had a lot of time to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| Whether we really wish to commit to an appeal or whether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| I mean there are several parties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| You've got MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| And this was basically the MPC part of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| The chancellor found that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| Among other things that the process was flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| The chancellor found that MPC acted arbitrarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Capriciously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| We wholeheartedly disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| But it is the ruling of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| And so a decision is going to have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Within the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Less than that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Of whether to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| We may wish to file a notice of appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| To talk about it for a few days longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Maybe at the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| We may wish to file a notice of appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| To talk about it for a few days longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Maybe at the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| For Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| A decision hasn't been made yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| The Knox County portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Has yet to be tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| What happened at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| In approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| MPC's actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| As well as the additional cog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| In.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| That process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| The allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Of an open meetings violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| As related to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| A meeting that was had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| At the board of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Stuck between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| How much money do we have in the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| We have ten million dollars in the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Speaking to your timing question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| You asked specifically about the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| The other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=588)|

| 0:09:50| Avenue that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Exploring and going through at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| That the East County sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| They've had one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| I expect from what they told us that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| The next one will be in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| And we are going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| As part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Make our case as to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| This property should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Shown for land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| As a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| It was a 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| And a 2005 study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| That identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| That identified this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| As being appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| And a good use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| And we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| We're going to make that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| It'll go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| I would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| First part of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| That.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| We're leaving all our options open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| But we certainly are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Very involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| And plan to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| In the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| The sector plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| And I expect there will be those involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| Will have a different opinion than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| But we'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| It'll work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| However, it works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| We still believe that this is a good piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| For this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| For many reasons that we express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| When NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Approve this thing back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Back in 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| Back when this body approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Back in 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| What's the timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| If you get everything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Say in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| What's the timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Getting the sewer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=683)|

| 0:11:26| To have a business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| We're seeing out north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| That businesses are putting their construction stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| On hold for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| I don't know if that's a trend that you're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Or are you having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| People flood your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Saying we want to go to Midway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| As soon as you can get the roads in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| And how many acres do we have in Knox County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| And in a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Or that you all own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| That a business could go to right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| I'll let you answer those questions first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| I think there was three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=718)|

| 0:12:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| As far as timing goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| We have a couple of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| On sanitary sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| One of which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| We can control ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| And that is to do an on-site system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Which we could develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Another option that has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| And discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| Is to become part of a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| For a regional wastewater treatment plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| That would serve that whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Drainage basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| If we go with our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Doing it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Putting all our money into a system that only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| Supports the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| I believe that we could have product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Toward the end of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| With the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Considering the sector plan amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Or sector plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| And that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| And that that works in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| There is interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| That we have prospects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Looking at property in town right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| And there continues to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Companies that are investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| We are a little bit insulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| From some of the ups and downs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| That the national economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| Sees as far as investment goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| But we are not completely isolated from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| There's a little bit slowing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| But that's not to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| There's not interest in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| And by no means dead in time to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| Acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=812)|

| 0:13:41| You don't have to go through each part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| I want to go through each part if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=823)|

| 0:14:02| Hardin Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| We just opened up in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| You come into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| There's a brownfield site called Brookside Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| 19 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Then you go to Eastbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| There's 200 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| In total that's about 360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Then there's another 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| That we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| That will become available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| In Pell City Corporate Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Due to ACN not being able to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| With their plans on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| So in total that's about 410.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| We have been historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=873)|

| 0:14:41| Since 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| When Development Corporation first got interest in property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Around 34 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| A year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| And since 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| It's been more like about 41 acres a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| When you plan for property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Just like saving for your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| It's a little bit late to start doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| When you're 65 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| Same with property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=902)|

| 0:15:06| In order to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| To attract companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Into our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| If we wait to where at the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| That we really have nothing left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| That's very attractive for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Shame on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| We are not doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=919)|

| 0:15:23| And yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| It's time to be doing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| But if you don't have a variety of product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| A product that's attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| And desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Nobody's going to come look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| You can't expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| That you're going to sell every last acre you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=936)|

| 0:16:24| This year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| We've had zero acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| And we've got 410 acres available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| If you count the Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=990)|

| 0:16:45| Your amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| If we can count it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1006)|

| 0:19:46| That's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| One of the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Our sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Have been so low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Like ten acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| That's all we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Is small tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| What's the largest track we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| We have the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| To put about a hundred acres together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Out in East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| That's the only place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| We have any left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| That's large tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Large tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| And East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Is the hardest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| For anybody to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| It is the most remote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| One of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Is further out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| We'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| We've got some great companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| In East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| But it's a little harder sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| For a lot of companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Because of its distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| To the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| And what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| There is this 400 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| We've got a hundred of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| And the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| In small tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Everybody talks about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| How we lost out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| To the Volkswagen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| To Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| We had no place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| To put them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| If they wanted to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| We couldn't really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Try to recruit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Could we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| So the requirements would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| To do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| In Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| I really feel like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| We need this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Because Knoxville needs jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| And if anybody wants to come in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| That's going to employ anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| To mount anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| That needs a large track of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| We have no place to put them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| We do need large tracks of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| To help recruit business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| I just want to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| If.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Let's say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Happens to be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| We do lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| The various lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Just strictly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| From an investment standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Would you think this would be a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| To sell that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| If we were going to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Would it be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| To hold on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| For a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| When the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Came back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Would it be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| To hold on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| For a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| When the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Came back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Would it be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| To hold on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| For a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Would it be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| To hold on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| When the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Came back a little stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| That if we were in a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| We had to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| We certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Would not sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| By public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Its value is in its size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| You don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| You would just have to hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| One showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| The real estate economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Is flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| At best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| I'm not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| To make an official opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| And that's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| I'm not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| To make an official opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| And that's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| I'm not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| To make an official opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| And that's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| You're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| You're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| You're in the property buying business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| With the industrial development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| And I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| That everybody I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| In the property business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Is complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| About how bad the market is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| And how they're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| To make a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| They're having to sell things cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| So I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| First of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| I think it would be a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| To sell this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| But second of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| If we were going to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| This would be a pretty bad time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| To sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| That's why I'm supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Mr. Luthold's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| I'd like to call on Mr. Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| And then I have another word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| I have a question for Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Before you sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Can I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| You can get it after he goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Let him go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| I want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| We got what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Three hundred and eighty acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| In Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| About.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| That's approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| We thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| How shortage hay is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Are we using that property for anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Can we lease it out and maybe get the tax money back until we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| We are leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| There was a gentleman that was previously leasing that property from one of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| owners that we bought that from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| And we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| As the extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| We are continuing his arrangement that he had prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| And have extended that on to some additional properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| And then there are a couple others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| So we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| We are leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| We are leasing portions of that property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Is that for hay rides or cattle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Or what's he doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| So is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| How much are we bringing back on what he is leasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| I don't have those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| I can get those for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| I figure that would probably offset the taxes that we are losing through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Because as expensive as hay is, it would bring a lot of money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| I'm just curious if we is doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Thanks, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Commissioner, thank you for hearing this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| My name is Bob Wolfenbarger, 8416 Kodak Road, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1435)|
| 0:24:03| And I'm speaking for the 8th District Preservation Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| And I feel like I'm in a dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| I've got county commissioners that Scott Moore, for example, over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| arguing the point why this is a bad investment and it's the wrong idea to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| which the community said that from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| And I've got Commissioner Lambert over here talking about how we know this is the wrong time to sell anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| and, you know, these are the points that I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| I feel like I've walked into a dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Of course, I had a list of things I was going to read here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| Most of them have already been made, but if I may hit them just quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Litigation is still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| The law director has pointed that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| There's two lawsuits still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| And there may be others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| We are committed to making sure that the sector plan is not violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| And we're committed to making sure this community continues to be an agricultural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| I appreciate Commissioner Harmon's opinion about agriculture is still viable in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| And it's going to become more and more important to all of us as global warming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| and other things take effect and we find out that food is not growing exactly like it would have it be growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| So, you know, those are things that we need to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| and we'll get a chance to talk about in the future, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Todd mentioned that he paid $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| I've heard $12 million for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Of course, now I want to remind commission that you also advanced $7 million for this on-site sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:28| and quote infrastructure development in addition to that money spent to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| So that's getting up a little bit more, closer to $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| I'd figure not to mention the $800,000 paid for commission to the realtor that put the deal together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| Of course, that probably came out of some other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| I don't know where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| But the bottom line is this is a $20 million investment on the part of Knox County taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| and it would be prudent that we be patient and diligent in making sure we do the right thing with this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:57| whatever the results happen to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| I can assure you that the community will stay engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| We expect to be part of the process and a part of the decision making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| and how the land is going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| I know that it's not the forum right here to discuss it because we're opposed to selling the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| I want to be on the record and make sure I say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| I was so carried away, so excited that everybody else was making my arguments for me that I forgot to point out that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| is opposed to the county taking a bath on this property now that the investment has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| And we're looking forward to being engaged in the process of determining what is the best use for all of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| and the community with regard to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| So I would recommend and suggest that somebody should raise the motion that you not defer this, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:50| Well, the motion is to withdraw this from the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Excuse me, not withdraw this specifically, but just to absolutely vote it down now, if you could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Mr. Chairman, I agree in that whenever I read 915, it says to sell by public auction the Midway Road property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:09| I view that to be just yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| And at one point in time there weren't any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| We could have voted, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| We already have a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| You know, I think I can see the handwriting on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| I don't care that I can just make a, if I can, just withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| If the people that he's representing, the preservation association, if they're in favor of keeping this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| I'm trying to, what I've talked to a few people out in the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| I certainly thought they were for getting rid of the property and keeping that land back to ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| So if they're willing, wanting the business part, then certainly I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| If I may respond to Mr. Moore's comment, we won't be getting rid of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| The land is still in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| We're going to live with it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| We're concerned about how it's going to be developed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| So due respect, we have to live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| We're going to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| You want to keep it as a business part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| We just want to keep the land in a pristine agricultural sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| So you want to withdraw this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I'll withdraw it, but one question for Todd that Commissioner Harmon had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| You're leasing the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Is the, are you all keeping the money or are you forwarding it to Knox County government for the taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| We're putting that money into a fund to develop that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| and to help pay for the things that it takes to own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| How much are you getting for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| I don't have those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Can you send that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| And the money that you've got in front of you, Mr. Wolfenbarger, is it $7 million for the sewer treatment plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:53| It's for all development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| So we've got that money right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| You're not spending it on anything, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| We still have that money, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| I'll just withdraw it if the people of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| May I ask, though, that if you do vote to withdraw this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| that we don't have to be coming back here every month because you didn't take action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| That's why we're back this month is because it was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| And Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| I make a promise I will not put it back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| The 8th District doesn't seem to, they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| They seem to want to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| So you don't want to hear me put it back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| It was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Did you have something, Commissioner Roundtree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| I noticed Ms. Rice came towards the podium and I didn't know if she wanted to say anything or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| Maybe she moved now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| I know she didn't want to add any more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| I'll be very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Rhonda Rice, 17 Market Square, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Just let me reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Thursday of last week I turned down a project that was 200 acres on the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| because we didn't have anything in Knox County that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| They were looking for something that they could start developing in 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| We're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| If we wait any longer, we're still going to be turning down those types of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| We are seeing activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| We are seeing companies expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| I think we, this is not the time to draw back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| This is the time we have to continue to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Knox County is a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| We need to continue to show our leadership efforts and move forward on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| and continue so that we can maintain the economic vitality in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| And anything that we can do to continue to support those efforts is greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:47| I'll withdraw my substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| Everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| See no more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Well, we really did that quickly, 31 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| Back to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| That was quick for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| No action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Did you read the first zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| First, I want to let the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Do you have anything to say on the ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| Just a couple of details about the court's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| The court found that the authority to amend the sector plan rests solely, solely with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:33| Our growth policy amendment requires a little different approval mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| So it's something that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| It requires that sector plan amendments come to this body for the ultimate approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:51| That's been the way that we've done business for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| The court's opinion goes on, and it's fairly brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| It is really just five pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| It goes on and it says that the planning commission must first adopt the amendment to the county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:14| and then pass it on to county commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| And we have to do a double take whenever we read that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| because it just makes it very confusing after the previous statement by the court is that the court finds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| that the authority rests solely with the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| So we've been kicking these things around a bit among the professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| and trying to figure out the best course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| And we really haven't settled on a course to bring you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| I know it concerns some of the attorneys that I see sitting out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| It concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| It concerns MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| It concerns the Development Corporation and members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| We're going to have to, and MPC has already taken steps to tweak their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:16| They are, if this matter were to be reconsidered by MPC, you would see a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:27| And, you know, that may be the best route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| What I like to do when I see an opinion that we wholeheartedly disagree with is to appeal it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:42| and to let three judges take a look at it, because I know it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| I know it's flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| But maybe the best course is for MPC to basically go through a redo, for MPC to consider it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:59| and to go back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| I remember the process from a few years ago, and it was a bloody process, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:10| But be that as it may, that may be the best way to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| But we just haven't decided on the best way to bring it back to you to consider what our course of action ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2053)|
| 0:34:23| We now know that what the court has said, but what I just read you, there's some ambiguity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| And we just haven't decided on the best course of action to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| Mark, do you all wish to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| Only to the extent that we agree with you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| You know, this may be one of those things where we also talk to the author Seymours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| and the John Kings and the like and see if they have any seasoned enlightenment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| which I know they have, on the best way to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| It's a real problem, because this body, through the growth policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:15| has the authority to certainly to approve sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| Now, as long as sector plan amendments are approved and adopted by MPC and they come here, you know, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:28| this is supplementary, but what happens when you disagree with a sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| And that's our issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| It very rarely happens, but that's what we're trying to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| We don't have a good answer for you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| Director, would you care to fax us a copy of all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| I'll get it copied for you before you leave tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Mr. Owens, what would it hurt if we just let MPC make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| and it not even come to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| I mean, is that all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| Because the growth policy amendment provides otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| Does the growth policy trump Chancellor Fanzler's ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| I think maybe I would like for the Court of Appeals to have a shot at trumping Chancellor Fanzler's ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| But, I mean, right now, if the growth policy says we're supposed to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| but we've got a court ruling that says we don't do it, and we just let MPC do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| and it doesn't come to the county commission at all, would that not be legal, since we've got a court ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:46| I mean, very clearly, if a matter such as this proceeded in the same way and went before this Chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| we know what the result would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| But it's not as easy either to change the growth policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| The last time we worked through that was 2001 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| Just give us a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Talk about some of the stuff that's on here tonight dealing with sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| Do we need to act on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Not according to Chancellor Fanzler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| So anything that has to do with the sector plan amendment, we can just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| According to our growth policy, we would be in violation of that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Even the ones that went back to MPC and they approved it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Well, no, there is one that's gone back, and that's a different kettle of fish that we'll cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| But for now, what we would like to do is to proceed, consider the sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:54| If there is going to be a disagreement with MPC's approval of the sector plan agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| the sector plan amendments, then ergo the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| Like I say, very rarely does that occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| But if it doesn't tonight, then we have one more month to study it to see what our avenue is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Clerk, first two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| This is a request of LKM Properties LP slash MPC for northeast county sector plan amendment from low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:39| and neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| This property is located at the intersection of Ellis Town Road and Millertown Pike in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:50| The next one is an appeal by LKM Properties for MPC denial of rezoning from agricultural to general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2330)|
| 0:39:04| This property is located on the southwest side of Ellis Town Road, southeast of Millertown Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Arthur Seymour, Jr., on behalf of the applicant and the property owner, Miss Georgia Weddington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| If I may, this was a matter that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Well, let me get MPC's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Mr. Chair, commissioners, as was alluded to, this was an item that was referred back to MPC for reconsideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:39| of the initial original request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| You did have it on your previous agenda as an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| MPC initially considered the request, and it was for a sector plan amendment from commercial to CA zoning for the southwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:56| corner of the intersection of Ellis Town Road and Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| Part of that property, in terms of the zoning, is already zones commercial A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| They were asking for additional property that was going to be added to also be zone commercial A to get one larger track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:19| The southwest corner, however, on the sector plan was shown as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| On the rezoning map, the other three corners are already zoned commercial A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| but they were not identified in the sector plan as being part of a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| But, in essence, currently all four corners are zoned commercial A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| but none of the property is designated for a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| The matter was referred back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| We considered it as an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| We amended our review of it to change the request from low-density residential to neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2455)|
| 0:41:04| and we took a look at all four corners since all four corners were already zoned commercial A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| The staff on the rezoning side only looked at the southwest corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| which was the part of the initial request to look at changing the zoning for the CA portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:25| and the portion that was meant to be included in CA recommended rezoning that to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| The staff recommended that approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| The neighborhood commercial zone, the staff felt like, was better suited for exactly neighborhood commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| It also has some design guideline criteria that will ensure in these kind of situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| that the development of the site will have some protection, especially as it relates to the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2512)|
| 0:42:01| So you had a staff recommendation to show all four corners for neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| and to rezone the entire southwest corner, including the track already zoned CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| zone that to the neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| You don't want to be confusing, but you've got a recommendation from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| You have a neighborhood commercial plan category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| and you have a neighborhood commercial zoning category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Commissioner, looking at all of that, looking at the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| considering additional testimony from the applicant as well as the opposition, felt like, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| the end result was they only focused on the southwest corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| They felt like that that was the issue at hand and they should essentially focus just on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| They felt like there were some issues with regard to the fact that with the proposed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| there would be the necessity for possibly several zoning variances that would be more in keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| with the proposed use, which I believe is for a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| The property, when you put it all together, does allow for additional property to be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| that can be used as a buffer for adjacent abutting properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| that will still be maintained in residential and rural zoning, the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| So they felt that that was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| So by a vote of 11 to 1 with one recusal, MVC voted to approve the C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:35| commercial plan designation for parcels 17 and 18, which is, again, the original request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| And then on the rezoning to approve CA general business for parcel 18 as originally requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| which is the extension of what was already there for commercial A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| And that was also by a vote of 11 to 1 with one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| Thank you, Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Did you have a question for Booth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| No, I just wanted to make a motion to approve based on MVC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Well, we have to, it's an appeal, so they have to argue it out first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:13| Which one wants to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| I'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Mr. Chairman, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| I'm Lee Moore, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue here on behalf of the applicant and the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:27| I'm showing a diagram here, and we're focusing on the southwest quadrant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| The applicant owns this tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| It is already zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Mrs. Weddington, who is 70 years young, owns this tract here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| She came to the owner of this parcel and said, I would like to sell this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| I would like to move to a condominium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| And the applicant said, if we can have that rezoned to CA, we will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| Somehow the issue has come up as if the existing CA property will not support the proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:12| Here is the intersection of Millertown Pike and Ellis Town Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:19| Weigels can locate a store on the existing CA property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| There are a couple of issues with that store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| One, it will have basically its main entrance on Ellis Town Road rather than Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| If Mrs. Weddington's property can be rezoned, the configuration will be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| The main entrance will be on Millertown Pike, a secondary entrance on Ellis Town Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| the frontage towards Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| Mrs. Weddington's property will allow better buffering between adjoining residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2754)|
| 0:46:03| than being forced to utilize the existing CA property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| We are here basically asking you to approve the MPC recommendation that Mr. Johnson just presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:20| That is a commercial sector plan for lots 17 and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| Lot 17 here is already zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| That's the one at the immediate corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Lot 17 or parcel 17 is already zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| It will support a Weigels store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| So the issue is not whether or not a Weigels store will be built at this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| The issue is will one with better buffering and separation from surrounding areas be built there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:54| And if lot 18 is approved for CA zoning, that can be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2814)|
| 0:47:02| Mrs. Weddington, I'm going to ask her to stand because she has been to her fourth planning meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| and a number of her neighbors are here with her tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| and I would ask them to stand who are in favor of this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| and in favor of approving this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| And they live right there on Ellistown Road or Millertown Pike, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| And you all are immediately affected by this rezoning and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| So we are asking that you approve the commercial sector plan for lots 17 and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| MPC has already approved those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| And that you rezone lot 18 CA so that a proper boundary can be established between the Weigels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2868)|
| 0:47:59| and proper buffering between the adjoining property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| And I'll be happy to answer any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| May I save my remaining 30 to 45 seconds for rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| You get three minutes for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Jeff Brandon, 2703 Ellistown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| My property is located two houses away from this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| I've got a couple of questions, and you'll have to forgive me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| I'm not going to be as eloquent as obviously the attorney here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| But there's been a couple of times when we came before, one of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| I think it was Commissioner Briggs, asked if this was spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| And I believe this is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| You have a very rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| There should be some photographs in your packet depicting the cow field across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| You know, I cut hay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| I have horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| This is a very ag area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| There is not a business there other than one that was started back in the 40s, an old country store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:14| I want to ask again, at MPC it was brought up, is this spot zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| I'd like to ask Mr. Donaldson, is this spot zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| I would like somebody to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Any of the commissioners that's been out to the property, is this spot zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| The second point that I want to make before we get into the question and answer part is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| when we were here a month ago, the sector plan has never been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:45| There's never been any studies done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| There's never been any traffic or, you know, water quality studies or anything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| It doesn't call, the sector plan does not call for this type of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| A change of the zoning in the sector plan without a sector plan amendment, and I like this word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| makes it arbitrary and capricious because it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| Nothing has been done to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| The sector plan does not show this as CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| Another violation, I feel, is that, you know, there was never any --I don't see any regulations that says that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:20| you know, county commission can refer this back to MPC to reconsider once they had already reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| Now, the law director here said, oh, it was NC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| It was NC, but then during the middle of it, oh, no, let's just go back to CA again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| Well, you know, I'm pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| We're there the first time for CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| It gets shot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| We're there a second time for, quote, unquote, NC, and suddenly we're back at CA and it gets overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:50| Now, I feel like that's a second bite of the apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| They heard CA the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| They voted CA the second time without waiting the one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| You know, it's my understanding that county commission is supposed to either approve it or disapprove it, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| not send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Now, I don't know all of your regulations exactly, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| it just seems like that that's just not the way that this is supposed to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| And the issue with Weigel's building on that corner lot, there's a church across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| again, I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| It's my understanding that there's a hundred, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| a hundred-foot rule for selling beer and lottery tickets and things like that of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| And they cannot build that store and have those items on their existing piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| That's why they want the second piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| And we can go into the history of it, of how they approached Mrs. Weddington prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| when they first purchased the whole corner lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| and she turned them down until some circumstances changed her mind, and then she approached them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| So, essentially, you know, I want to know, is this spot zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| Anybody that's been out there to see the property, to take a look at this, is it spot zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| Are we changing anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Is there a logical extension or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Secondly, and I want to submit this for the record, I do have a petition of people who have signed this opposing the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| which I'll submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| And then also the chancellor's decision, talking about MPC, says one of the things he quoted was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:27| I guess it's the county code of the proposed amendment shall be necessary because of substantially changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| or changing conditions in the area and zones affected or in the county generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| It was a set-off section in his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| And then he later wrote, regardless of whether the section creates a mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| or is merely a guide, that MPC considered no evidence regarding substantially changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| or changing conditions in the area and zones affected or in the county generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| Nothing has changed within the two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| We've not gotten any new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| We've had continuing stuff that went on in the initial application, but nothing else has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| There's no new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| There's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| So I'd like to keep the rest of my time before rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| You have a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| I would like an answer to the question of is this spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| Mr. Seymour, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| I'd like to answer that question, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| This is not spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| It's the extension of an existing CA that currently is in place on one of the lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:34| extending it to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| The sector plan was amended by the planning commission at its August 14th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| It was referred back to MPC by the commission last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| I think that's a pretty healthy process, particularly when we have conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| or potential conflicts to create some dialogue between the two bodies to get onto the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| It may be something that we want to do more of in the future, given the court's ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| With regard to the 12-month waiting period, this last effort was actually an application for the plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:17| by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| We expanded the property to look at all four corners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| and we looked at a less intense zoning classification going from the commercial to the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:31| Those are all three factors for taking a look at a plan amendment within that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:41| Okay, Mr. Seymour, three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| Very briefly, Mr. Donaldson answered the questions that were posed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| I'd like to ask Mrs. Faust to hand out a petition that has signatures from people on Allistown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:59| and Millertown adjacent to the property supporting this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| Representatives of the church mentioned a moment ago were present at the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| and stated that they were not in the public session, but after the meeting that they were happy that this project was going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:21| Across from them, that it would provide a needed commercial use for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| There have been other changes in zoning along Millertown Pike with increased residential density along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:39| I would simply second what Mr. Donaldson has already said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| and we would ask again that you approve this as MPC and concur with MPC on the approval of the commercial sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:55| and approve the CA zoning on lot 18, which is Mrs. Weddington's lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3355)|
| 0:56:03| so a new and improved Weigel store can be built rather than the one proposed solely on lot 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| If there are any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| A question, Arthur, or maybe you or Mr. Weigel, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| It seems to be the biggest thing that opposition is in is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| And I agree with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| I don't see this spot zoning because it's been, it was already established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| Now, if he's just coming tonight saying, I want to make this little four-corner, I want to make it commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| yes, that would be spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| When, how long has that been zone commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| Who would know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Mr. Weigel or just a ballpark figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| It's been, as far as the memory of man runneth back, it's not something that occurred last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| or the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| It's been five, ten years, maybe even longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| Fifty years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| It's already been there fifty years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| There was an old grocery store at another corner on this intersection with gas tanks in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| that were removed fairly recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| This has been a commercial node out in that part of the county for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| Ms. Weddington says fifty years, which is about as long as the county, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| When did it first adopt a zoning ordinance, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| It was back in the 40s, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| Well, I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| That was before I was born, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| You may have been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Speak for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| But, you know, if they were, if you all were coming tonight saying, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| we just want to take this intersection out in the country because it's out in the country area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| We want to make this commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| And I wouldn't be before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| But because it is already zoned commercial and you're just adding a little bit more to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| I don't see the problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Less than an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| If we have any more rebuttals, if we don't, I'd like to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Yes, he gets three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| Mr. Brandon, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| Gas tanks removed fairly recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Gas tanks were removed 30-plus years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| It was a country store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| It stayed a country store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| The zoning, I know the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| It belonged to my great-aunt, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| What had happened was my grandfather, who at that time owned that country store, the state came through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:32| bought all his commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Uncle Esco, another relative that owned that corner lot, he was working on cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:42| Okay, let's go ahead and, you know, zone this commercial since I'm doing a commercial enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| Essentially, it was a handshake and a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| And the thing is on that, he died like in 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| He worked out of a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| Not until literally a month ago, it had a great big champion spark plug sign painted onto the block wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| It was a car garage is all it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| It was not a commercial operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| It has not been a commercial operation for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Additionally, when this was referred back to MPC Commissioner Leuthold, you asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| and I've got the CD and I could, you know, probably bring it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| You asked, are we not reconsidering sending this back with a change of zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:37| And there was some mealy mouth kind of, you know, responses and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| And then, bam, it's back at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Now, the end result at the end of the day, they heard CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| They heard CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| MPC decided against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| Now, here we are back again, and it's CA again through little slights of hand, and they approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3596)|
| 1:00:04| Now, you know, if that's not the second bite of the apple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| or if we're not going back to the same watering trough, I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| One last thing, unless I need some more rebuttal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| I have retained David Boock for this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| So, just to go on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| A question about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| I've got a question for our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| John, why did you say that more of these should go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| That seems to be an issue with the young man here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| It relates to what Mr. Donaldson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| Given the court's opinion, sector plan amendments, if we have a disagreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| which there was a lot of discussion about this at the last zoning meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| if we have a disagreement with MPC on a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| maybe the best course for now would be to send it back for reconsideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| if you don't feel that it's been given adequate coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| I know there were some statements made that MPC didn't consider all of the evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:20| may should have had more discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| And so I thought it was a proper motion and a proper action by this body to send it back for reconsideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:35| basically deferred it back for another go at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| and to allow this gentleman to bring in more evidence if he needed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| and to allow Mr. Seymour and the folks to bring in more if they needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| But there was a lot of discussion, I think, about the lack of support in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| And so that was one way to cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| That was one way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| And if there is a disagreement, given the court's opinion, that may be the best way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:11| You through, Commissioner Bowen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Eighth district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| I think Elaine made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| And I'll go ahead and second that based on the explanation of Mr. Donaldson, our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| To?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| For MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| For MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Sector plan and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| Both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Can you split that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| I'd like for it to be split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| You know, I'm not against the project, but certainly Chancellor Fensler says we don't have the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| no, on the first one, but certainly not because I don't think it's a good project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| or it needs to go forward and it probably will go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| He doesn't say that you can't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| He says that basically voting on it is the sole province of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| And so he's more or less made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| So what's it doing on the agenda then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| More or less made your vote a nullity until we either appeal or do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:15| Do we need to take any action at all if MPC approves it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| The growth policy amendment says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| And the Chancellor says no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| So we've got to figure out who's at this point in time who's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| Who do we follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| You do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| Make them both right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:30| You do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| If you approve of MPC's adoption of the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:38| you do not run afoul of Chancellor Fensler's ruling, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:46| You have not violated his ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| And you're in compliance with the growth policy amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| What if we come up and it would have been that MPC recommended denial of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:59| Of the sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| If the commission was in favor of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| According to Chancellor Fensler, it would be denied because this body, he would say, has no authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:13| It would have been denied even if the commission would have approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| So it doesn't matter what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| MPC made the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| Like we, you know, like we've said, like I've said a couple of times tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| we're somewhat between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| We really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| Legally, we're trying to figure out what steps to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| We have appeal options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| We have other options where we could redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| We could accept everything the Chancellor had to say and proceed according to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| If this is approved by this body tonight, then you are in compliance with the Chancellor's ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3891)|
| 1:05:01| as well as the growth policy amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| Buzz, do you and Mark disagree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Within the growth policy plan, the land use plans for each of the sectors have been adopted by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:17| as well as the planning commission and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| In order to keep that current, that adopted land use plan current with our other sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:29| we want to have everybody singing off the same sheet of music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| We want to keep that growth policy land use plan consistent with all of the other, the general land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:45| Acting in accordance with the MPC's sector plan amendment does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:53| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| We can take it separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| First one is the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Any noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| DeFries, Moore, and Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| Certainly not because of I think it's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| Motion carries 16 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| The appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| DeFries and Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| Motion carries 17 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=3996)|
| 1:06:47| The next one is a request of Sundown Properties for a north county sector plan amendment from medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4007)|
| 1:06:56| and office to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| This property is located on the northeast side of Connor Road, southeast of Tate Trotter Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| northwest of East Emory Road in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Arthur Seymour, Jr., on behalf of the applicant and the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| Oh, there they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| And we are asking for approval of the sector plan as approved by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:30| and approval of the zoning as approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Seeing none, I'm going to let the 7th District, but she jumped on in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4059)|
| 1:07:50| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Commissioner Smith, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| I just want to make a comment real quick, Arthur, that these gentlemen and I think Scott may want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| agree, these gentlemen have jumped through hoops and have done sort of a new project for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| They met with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| I went there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| They had two meetings that I know of and that I was in attendance in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| And I really applaud you guys for the way that you did and the way that you embraced the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| and asked them what they wanted and you went back to the drawing board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| and came back with what they wanted and tried to work with there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| And most people don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| That was a class act, what you guys did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| And I really appreciate what you all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| I hope it works for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| And so I'll second the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| And I'll second what Commissioner Smith says, except I'd like to split the question because I'm going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| to vote the same way on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| But I do think it's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Mr. McKenzie, per MPC recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| Yes, per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| For both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| We'll split it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Any request of the first one, 6F08SP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Well, I was going to ask the law director to comment on the sector plan because this did not go back before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| or did it as far as their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| I mean, does the approval process of MPC follow what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| Apparently there was no objection to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| I don't see anyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| No one's here questioning the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| No one is here questioning the hearing before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| At MPC there was a neighborhood representative who stood up and spoke in favor of the approval of the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:37| as well as the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| So how is this different from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| The other one was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| The other one was denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| It went back and didn't get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| But MPC has approved this sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| And the other one, as well as that, I mean, there was opposition to the last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| and I understand that it was a close vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| So it was proper for you to send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| We'll divide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| The first one, like I said, 6F08SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Put me down as a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Would you raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| Motion passes, 16 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Second one, 6J08RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4226)|

| 1:18:21| Ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Commissioner Pinkston and Commissioner, who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| Brown Tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Which is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| I didn't get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| You have something, Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| Oh, we need to let you get a word in before you go to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| Mayor Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| That's your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| Do you have something, Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| I just wanted to ask how much the lease was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Did you have something, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| No, I was going to say if anyone had any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Can we negotiate that, Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| This is the piece of property where we owned in the Forks of the River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| and we traded with the trucking company coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| And rather than the kids playing in the mud on the new field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| the owner of the property that we used to own is going to allow soccer to be played on the grass for the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:22| No cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Until we can get a state permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| That's the one to hang up and finish the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Resolution 803 is approving the amounts designated to close fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:45| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| Voted 9-0 to approve with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| 9-1, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| What was the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| There was an election commission had $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| They had asked for it to be returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| And they decided they did not need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:15| Commissioner Pinkston, could you talk into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| About $8 million total now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| And it was $125,000 election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| It was on the original list and asked to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| But what I'm talking about, I read in the paper the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| and we got the thing where you said we come a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| Had another million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| But if we didn't give this money to these people, would that be $8 million more into our rainy day fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4833)|
| 1:20:42| It would be divided by fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| And so the biggest piece would go to the schools and remain with the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| So there's another $700,000 plus for the general fund, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| But if we didn't give any of this money back, what I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| It would just go to fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| Go to the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| And this money is over and above this $1 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| Over and above, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Okay, that's what I wanted to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| If you look where the election commission had asked for $125,000 out of 96,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| I guess count out 99, 69, 20 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| I'd just like to throw out for a discussion, could we take 2,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| add 2,000 more to each commissioner's discretionary fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| That's $38,000 and the rest of it go back in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Just because there have been a lot of things that we've cut out of the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| as far as discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| That's just, you know, my community ballparks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| and other people have asked for more money this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| And I think I've already gave out probably a total of all mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| So if we have that money, it's available to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| I bought a smart board, me and Larry at Adrian Burnett, $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| And, you know, we've got 125,000 sitting there, so we could take 38| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| and give everybody two more thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| I'll put it out for a motion to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| We have a motion already on the floor and you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| I can do a substitute motion to take 38,000 out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| 125,000 and add it into the discretionary fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| I'll get a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Go ahead, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| I mean, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| John, can we not use some of this money to pay back on our indebtedness that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| What's your opinion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| That is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| I feel like we should reward these departments who have worked hard to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| And I think it sends a good message to everybody not to try to spend all your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| And if you have money left over, that there would be funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| Also, for instance, in the engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| they've had a couple of different projects, paving and traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| And the traffic light and the paving both got pushed from before June to after June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| And it's the same work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| but the timing of the work just happened to be pushed into the new fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| And we're just trying to match the budget with the work that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| So this is from a budgetary perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| He had planned on the work to be done in 08, and here we are in 09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| He just wants to carry that money forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| So how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Let me get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| If I'm not mistaken, the motion is to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| but the election commission has given back their 125,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| and Commissioner Moore wants to take 38,000 of that 125 to commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| and the rest of it goes back, not the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| So, yes, to answer the chair's question, yeah, we could assign the rest of that, 125,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| the difference to debt service, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| We're just talking about the 38,000 out of the 125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| The lights went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| I'm going to vote against us having more money in discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| You know, we're already spending more money than we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| We probably should have been more frugal in the first place during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| And I think there's going to be other expenses come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| We're going to have $80,000 that we basically voted that we're going to have to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| at least to confirm those signatures that we had the opportunity to say that we decided not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| Now we're taking another $38,000 out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| I think sometimes we're going to have to figure out how we're going to pay some of these bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| rather than how we're going to be spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| I'd just like to say with some of the commissioners making those outstanding comments to save money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| when I tried to cut the budget and cut the budget and cut the budget to save money during the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| these same individuals voted to give everybody the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| So I don't understand now when we really need this for the things that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| And the mayor was saying if we cut his, you know, some of the kids that come and need ball uniforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| we wouldn't be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| And we all gave this passionate plea that we want to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| And now we have an opportunity to help our districts with small money because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| there's a lot of times that, you know, it's not the big money that helps our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| It's the small ones that help individual children that can't afford to do things in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| or are fence broken or something that we need to get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| Like Adrian Burnett, me and Larry bought a smart board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| There's many, many schools across Knox County that already have them in every classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| And Adrian Burnett was three, I think, three classes they didn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| And we bought one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| I think ORNL bought one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| So these are the small things that we can help the children of our community and our seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| if they need help at senior centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| So I think if we've got the money there, I can't think of anywhere better to spend our money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| than on our constituents in our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| I want to also echo Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| I'm going to be voting against giving ourselves more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| But, John Tory, another question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| You said that we had a million dollars in savings that's gone into the general fund or the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| The million dollars is going to be revenues above expected budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Now, are we still looking at some cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| Because we had said the mayor said he was going to try to find one point, was it one and a half million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| So we're still looking at that as well in addition to the excess revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| We are, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| I just wanted to actually clarify, have clarification on what we were voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| So your motion is to approve with an amendment, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| But let me say if I wanted to, if we want to, if a commissioner doesn't want the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| let's say they don't have to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| But if a commissioner wants the $2,000, they can take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| Because there may be some Commissioner Briggs, Commissioner Hammond, it seems that they don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| But if another commissioner wants it, they ought to be able to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| I mean, we're elected officials, and I know we still need a majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| but certainly they should be able to vote if, you know, if they don't want it for their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| than other commissioners do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Mr. Law Director, is there a way to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| If you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| I don't think it takes the law director to do something, you don't have to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| If you don't spend it, it will go back to fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| Can I ask Commissioner Morgan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| If you wanted to take a vote right now to take a show of hands to all those commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| who wish to have the increase, you can do it that way, or you can not increase it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| or you could increase each person's discretionary fund by $2,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| whether you have the option of spending it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| Three ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| Well, what if we just take a show of hands of the commissioners that want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| Well, can I ask you a question first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| My question to you is, if I recollect correctly, we had discussed that if there were concerns like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| that you had something, a special project in your district, that you would come back to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| and we would approve those on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| So we had approved a dollar amount for our discretionary fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| And then anything above and beyond that that we felt was necessary to be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| that you could come back to this commission and ask this body and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| look, we've got these uniforms that these kids need help in funding, just as you made a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| But are we going to put a dollar amount per district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| Because it wouldn't be fair for one district to receive $10,000 and one to receive $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:47| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Just to be following up with that, is that if you want to make it every commissioner gets the $2,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| but any from the six to the eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| they would have to bring it back to this body to get approved before they could go above that $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| I mean, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| I mean, I'm probably going to use it for somewhere in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| I just think if we can help them because we didn't fund them what they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| I'm not saying you're not being altruistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| I'm just saying that, you know, we do need to set some limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| Well, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| Anything over the $6,000 could come back for commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| You're putting that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| If the commission, if that will make it go, because I think there's --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| But, you know, I think most of the commissioners' public record and usually are fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| We have to do a quarterly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| Our fine newspapers usually have where we spend our money anywhere, so anyway, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| To bring back memories to everyone, they will be doing a quarterly report on how we spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| Every dollar that is spent per quarter will be put online or in the paper or however they want to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| No, I was just going to ask that that not be put on because it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| I mean, it's public record if anyone wants to call and see how we spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| And it will be reported per quarter now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| Well, we'll just leave it the way we had it stated and, you know, hope you all vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| John, help me real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Mr. Troyer, are you, would you be able to take any of this money and pay back on any of our indebtedness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:22| Or is, are we going to use it for paving the roads and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| I mean, is that what, what's your plan to do with the money or the majority of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| I know you can't account for every penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| What's right off the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| Are you talking about what's on the agenda, about the designations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| You know, outside of the $125,000 that the Election Commission has done minus the $38,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| we could take the difference of $87,000 and put it toward debt service, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Would you like to weigh in on this, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| Not necessarily, but actually we, there was a, you may not have it in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| On the accounts that we asked to carry over, there was actually an explanation for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| and every account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| In almost every instance, we're talking about projects that got delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| And so that's why the money wasn't spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| The project is either delayed because it couldn't acquire right away, contracts couldn't be signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| In one instance, our contractor didn't have a pay for those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| So that's money to be carried over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| For instance, in halls, we did a tremendous amount of signal work in halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| The work is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| We have not paid that contractor because they invoiced us improperly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| So I need to carry that money over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| If I don't carry that money over, then essentially my entire budget is going to be actually pulled backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| So projects we had anticipated doing in this fiscal year are going to get pushed out even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| And this happens every, this is sort of how you work it every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| And what we don't do is we don't wait the last minute and do the spend it or lose it mentality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| If I've got a project that we're not ready to go with, I'm going to freeze that money on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| And these are worthwhile projects we're doing or I wouldn't be doing in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| We're going to freeze that money until everything is ready to go and then we're going to proceed on with that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| So it's really never been an issue if I had a delay in those types of things for carrying that money over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| Does everyone understand the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| And the $125,000 that the election commission has given back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| $38,000 will go to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| I want to say 202 fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| That's their fund, congressionary fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| And the rest of it, $87,000 will go to indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| To the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| Indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Well, shouldn't we let that $78,000 just go back to the election commission in case they need to have that money for the petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5566)|
| 1:32:54| No, they don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Oh, they don't want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5579)|

| 1:33:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| That's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5634)|
| 1:34:02| Motion fails ten to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| Did you ask if anybody wanted to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| Anyone want to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| Yes, the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| What was the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| We'll bring it back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| Well, we're back to the original motion, so I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| I made the original motion to approve with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| You had to with the amendment with an additional amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| Well, there's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| Well, I'll make a motion to approve with giving $1,500 to the discretionary fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5680)|
| 1:34:47| And if the commissioners don't want it, can I just take a show of hands, law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| the ones that want it can take it and the ones that don't, don't have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| You can go ahead and designate you can which commissioners wish to receive the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5696)|
| 1:35:03| You can fund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| That's certainly well within your prerogative tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| I don't know that that will make any difference with your motion, but you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| Well, I mean, it could be that people vote against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| and have some kind of just moral belief that they don't need it for themselves or their district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| but there could be some of us that think we do need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| So, you know, they could give it to the little Emily Barger case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| So what's your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| My motion, I'm trying to get it from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Can we do a show of hands for the people who want it and then we can calculate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| and add it to this thing as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| As long as your motion is clear and you know who is going to receive the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| and who is not is what is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| If the commission would like to have $1,500 extra to give out in their district, raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:57| I figured it's the same nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| So?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| It's the same nine, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| So I would add that the nine that voted to have $1,500 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| They didn't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| They just expressed their desire to have $1,500 more in discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| And so what your motion would be is that these individual commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| that $1,500 be added to their discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| A substitute motion that we approve the amounts designated to close the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:37| with the exception of the $125,000 from the Election Commission, that $125,000 go to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| Do you want to speak on the motion, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| The folks that are temporary commissioners that won't be here next month, have you all spent any of your discretionary money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5811)|
| 1:37:00| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| That's not on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| I think at the very least we need to replenish the discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| I'll repeat my point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| That's not on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| I don't want to get shouted down here, but we saw 75 people come up here from community-based organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:22| And we all empathized with them and talked about how we wish there was more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| We wish we could help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| It's not like this $2,000 is going to go to, you know, our pockets or our pet projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:40| We're talking about district activities that we as elected officials have deemed worthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5860)|
| 1:37:48| and that help the overall community out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| So, you know, I think it's a good thing, and so that's why I'm supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| Well, I mean, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| Repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| Substitute motion is that we approve the amounts designated close fiscal year with the 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| except for the $125,000 of the election commission and it go to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| We're going to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| I'd like to speak against the motion just for the same reasons we stated before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| Commissioner Briggs, turn your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| Well, I have something I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| I was telling Commissioner Moore to turn his light on, and then I said Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| Okay, Dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| Papa Bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| Okay, Papa Bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Have I been recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| I recognized you in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| I recognized you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| I told Commissioner Moore to turn his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| I interpreted that as for me to turn my light off and shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| I wish this would have come up earlier about having people shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| But anyway, I really agree very much with what Sam said over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| But I disagree with the method that they would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| I know there were some very worthy organizations that weren't funded during that grants process, and it still bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| But what I would suggest, and I'm going to ask the law director to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| to get back to this contingency budget fund, this line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| And this is a perfect example where we could take the funds such as this, put it in the contingency budget fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| When we have these individuals or these groups or whoever, you know, that need the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| or something else comes up, such as this $80,000 we're going to have to give back to the Election Commission to verify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| those signatures, they come before the commission, and rather than an individual trying to decide what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| we can decide as a commission whether it's worthy or not for them to take those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| And I think many times there's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| But I'm going to vote against this again, but I understand exactly what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| and I think we just need to have a different mechanism to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| And I agree with Dr. Briggs and to address Commissioner McKenzie's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6018)|
| 1:40:26| And there's some districts definitely that are represented on this body that have more needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:34| And certainly I think it would be, and I don't spend my discretionary funds just in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:42| and I would certainly be welcome to help as well as I think a lot of commissioners here for different needs around the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| This is a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| Knox County is a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| I don't consider segregating this community, dividing it up in any way by districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| Worthy things are worthy throughout the county, help the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| And so I'd welcome any kind of request like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| I'd like just to make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| I agree very much with what you say, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| If you look back, I spent three times more money out of my district than I did in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| and I was running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| And I really believe that I am a Knox County commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| I am the elected representative from my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| But I understand very much what Commissioner McKenzie is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| and that if we have people that need to be taken care of, I'll spend my money elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| I did this last period too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| Commissioner Moore, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| No, I'll just go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| I agree with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| But it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| It's easy to sit up here and say that we bring things back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| But when at a ball field the fence gets tore down or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| I helped last year at the girls' softball field out in Hollis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| They needed some batting cages, and we gave them like $500 for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| It's hard to come up here before commission and ask for $200 or $300 and get somebody to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:07| I mean, it's two commissioners in a district, and you all say, well, we want to look across the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| But when you look at a health care issue for a free clinic for $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| and then we've got right behind it $200 or $300 for a softball field or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| those are the needs that need to be taken care of maybe before every month at commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| where we can call up to the commission office and say we need to check for $200 for fence fixing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| at the Hollis ballpark or something if they needed that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| And those are just the things that you can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| And that's what we're there to do, to help our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| We're here to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| And we waste, I guarantee you, we waste a whole lot more money than another $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6162)|
| 1:42:50| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| The question was asked of the outgoing, the interim commissioners, how much we had spent of our discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6173)|
| 1:43:01| I want to go on record as saying that I'm turning over my full allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| Excuse me, Commissioner, I'm trying to talk here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| I want to go on record as saying I haven't spent any of my discretionary funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| and I'm going to leave those for Commissioner-Elect Anders to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| He knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| So whichever way this vote goes tonight, he'll have a full pocketbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Maybe we could address this by simply instead of putting the $125 in the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| maybe we can do a little bit what Commissioner Briggs has suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| If we could put it, designate it somewhere else to where that we could come back maybe in the new year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6216)|
| 1:43:47| say in January or something, and we could come back and take a look at where we're at financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| and see if we could maybe allocate those funds in a different way other than just placing it in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6232)|
| 1:44:00| And maybe we could come back and maybe we do designate each commissioner additional money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| or we designate it that we would vote on it as a block or for things that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:14| But it gives us an option instead of just simply putting it in the general fund, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| But can't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| I mean, if it's in the general fund, we can take it out anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| But at least at this point we've sort of designated it that we would come back and revisit it at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| and it could not go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| But if it's in the general fund, it's not going to go anywhere unless we appropriate it, right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| We have to appropriate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| We know that the $125 is there, and if we want to revisit it, we can revisit it at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6276)|
| 1:44:44| Just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| I have a question for Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:57| Greg, is it true that you are expecting to spend $80,000 on counting these signatures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6297)|
| 1:45:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| I believe that's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| We spent $17,000 counting 14,000 signatures for the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| We're looking at excess of 75,000 signatures now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| Are you turning this $125,000 back in when you may need $80,000 of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| Well, this is capital money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| This is money that we are going to use to buy more voting machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| We requested it a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| Since that time, you may have read the stuff in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| There's been some change in legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| We are not able to buy any voting machines at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| I guess it just never occurred to me that you would use capital money, which is borrowed money, for ongoing expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| Well, my suggestion is let's hold this $80,000 at least and give it back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| He's going to need it anyway, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| It will go back into the general fund, so I'm sure when he sends the bill, we have to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:52| That's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Just one more comment about what Commissioner Hammond said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| And I agree, you know, the money's there one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| But the difference is, is that you've got a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| And you're saying if we're going to say we're going to stick to the budget, we'll limit ourselves to the $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| If we're drawing out of the general fund, we get back into that same problem where you've got this $36| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6372)|
| 1:46:19| or $37 million fund that just appears to be a well that you can draw from endlessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:26| So I like having a budget and having contingency funds or whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| It doesn't mean we need to spend them all, but we need to say that that's the limit right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| rather than saying there is no limit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| And that's the only reason I would like to maintain it in the budget, but not in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6397)|
| 1:46:44| Commissioner Moore, we do need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| Yeah, I'm ready to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| I don't even care if we take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| I didn't think it would be that big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| But if $1,500 is going to disturb this whole commission, I'd just as soon put it back in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| But I'd like to remind everybody as we go through the budget again next year that we keep this same mentality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6417)|
| 1:47:04| to saving taxpayer money because we've certainly wasted a lot in last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6424)|
| 1:47:10| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Roll call starting at nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| Commissioner Paynes, turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| Does everyone understand the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| Explain it in case they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| To go ahead and pay the amounts designated to close the fiscal year, the $125,000, which you said were capital money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6447)|
| 1:47:34| I think you said, Greg, that money would go into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| It would go back into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| Starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6476)|

| 1:48:05| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6485)|

| 1:49:22| Is that where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| 805.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| 804 is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| No, 804 is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| 804 is on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| Mr. Chairman, I had taken that off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| I had a question, but I'm going to ask my question to the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| You took it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| I'm going to ask my question to the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| We don't need to debate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| So I took it off to ask a question, but I'm going to talk to our trustee about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6578)|
| 1:49:45| For once I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| So are we going to defer it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| I'll make a motion we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Now, wait just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6592)|

| 1:51:45| I'll speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| The 3,100 was the cost of the survey and then the difference for what Commissioner Wright is speaking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| includes the back taxes, which were the price of the property at the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:59| So how much are we refunding then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| The 42?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| What we're doing is get the 4,200 back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Yes, it would be everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| The total amount would be 4,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| 31 was the survey and the taxes were another $1,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| All we're giving them is the amount of dollars that they paid to get this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| We're giving back taxes plus the cost of the survey, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| What they had already paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6746)|

| 1:52:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6770)|

| 1:53:48| This is approving a lease agreement with MCI Communications Services, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6828)|

| 1:54:07| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| I would like to have an amendment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| This came up during the intergovernmental discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| and John Troyer has checked with me that this apparently would not upset the deal itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| because the real estate fee on this for simply extending an existing contract would amount to nearly $25,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6860)|
| 1:54:28| at the current rate, and I'm going to simply propose an amendment that the real estate fee not exceed $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| And, John, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| Yeah, I can just speak that I have not spoken with a broker about this, but you're certainly welcome to make your motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6878)|
| 1:54:45| I would like to make the broker fee not exceed $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| And a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| As an amendment to the existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| Does the amendment person agree to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| Do you agree to that, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| No, I believe it's the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| I don't even know who the broker is, but you said he spent several hours, a lot of time, putting this deal together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| He did work for this, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| We don't know what kind of agreement he has with Verizon either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| And one of the proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| We could lose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| What I'm saying is we could lose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| This gentleman has put this deal together for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| Am I being correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| And we could lose this by trying to get him to cut his fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| That's sort of like, you know, I was in the car business asking a salesman to cut his commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:47| Sometimes he'll say, well, just forget the sale, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| And we could lose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| And I really feel like, based on what you said, that there was a lot of hours and time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| and they did all the work on it that they're probably deserving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| Now, I realize it is a continuous for the lease agreement, but he's the guy that got the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:12| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| I'm going to be agreeing with Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| I think 2% is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| I don't know what that figures out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| But certainly if we can't afford to give our community, our kids and our seniors $1,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:26| surely we can't afford to give a broker $25,000 just to extend a current lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6986)|
| 1:56:32| I mean, they're already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| They've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| It ain't like we're going to lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| So I'm going to support Commissioner Harmon's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| Now, we don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| He may have another location, Mr. Moore, that he can take these people to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| John, have you said, did you talk to the agent or the broker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7006)|
| 1:56:53| I have not talked to him about changing the broker's fee, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| Who is the broker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| I'm going to get his name wrong, and so I hate to just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| Who's he with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| I couldn't tell you the firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| The firm was in earlier packet material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| It was NAI, and it's her, not a he.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| Do you know who it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| I can't remember the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| But whoever is the head of NAI can look it up, NAI Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7034)|
| 1:57:22| I mean, if it was a new lease and they'd come here and found the place and did all the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| but just to extend a current lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| Was he the original person who got the lease in the beginning, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7051)|
| 1:57:38| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| The first one was with PBA, and now that the A.J. building is in the county's name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| that has changed since the original agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| So this would be the first time with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| I think any of us, if you're out trying to buy a house or do anything, you negotiate that fee the best you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:57| And I don't know that we vetted that with the contract that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| So I support Commissioner Harmon's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| To answer your question, Commissioner Moore, the firm is NAI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| I'm not sure which of their individual brokers or whether it goes to their brokerage account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| There are nine principals in the firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| The leading principal is Maribel Coelho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| There are, again, eight others listed on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| Is that a Knoxville-based company or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| It appears to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| Yes, it is a Knoxville-based company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| And good that we're doing local business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| I just think, as you suggested, that a six percent of it over the five-year term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7106)|
| 1:58:33| yielding nearly $25,000 is excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| And I thought let's call it a substitute motion with the broker fee reduced to no more than $10,000 is a reasonable action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:46| How much is the lease a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| Right at $94,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| That's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| $94,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| It's the same thing we've got to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| We're going to renegotiate after we've already done a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| John, you said the lease was $94,000 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| Yes, it got in the caption as $82,000, but it was actually $94,000, I think, is in the written material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:13| That's roughly like Mr. Ballard said, about a half a million dollars there, $25,000 is not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7153)|
| 1:59:22| You've got to remember, all these folks didn't want to give $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7162)|
| 1:59:32| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| Yes, Mr. Troyer, is there a major difference between the prior contract and this current contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7174)|
| 1:59:42| From my recollection, my understanding is that $82,000 a year was the current contract and the $94,000 is the new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| So the only thing that changed was the actual dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| There's a number of provisions that are in there, but the primary change that we're interested in is the dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| Yes, but what I'm trying to get at is if there was any sort of, I know that Mr. Commissioner Pinkston said that they had probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7200)|
| 2:00:09| done some work, what I'm trying to determine is whether that was substantive work that would justify a 6% commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7209)|
| 2:00:17| If the only thing that changed was a dollar amount, it's hard for me in my mind to justify giving them a 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7217)|
| 2:00:26| I'm more inclined to agree with Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| He got us another $12,000 a year, according to what you're saying, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| But how old is the lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| What was the last term of the lease, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| Five years, and this is for a five-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| This was five years ago, that $82,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| So, you know, over five years, I'm sure rents have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Do you know what he's paying per square foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| It's in the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| I don't know offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| The commissions are listed on page 25, paragraph 1410.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7257)|
| 2:01:07| Right, and I was going to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| So it looks like half of it is going to NAI Knoxville, and half goes to this Jones Lang LaSalle Americas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7269)|
| 2:01:18| which doesn't sound like a local company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:30| That sort of sounds like someone Verizon may use as a national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| Yeah, they're based out of Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| So, you know, we're paying $28,000, almost $28,500 commission to renew an existing lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7303)|
| 2:01:55| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| Well, I really think before we go too far, because like Commissioner Pinkston said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| it's very possible that Verizon may have a contract with these brokerage firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7329)|
| 2:02:17| that they're going to pay X number of dollars or a percent of this lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7337)|
| 2:02:24| whether it comes out of our pocket or their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7344)|
| 2:02:29| And it's possible that they may want to renegotiate the entire contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| If we're only paying $10,000 and then they've got to turn around and pay $15,000 out of their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| they may want to reduce the terms to recoup that $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| I don't know if that's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| It might be wise to take 30 days to try to figure that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| and see what would happen if we do reduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7371)|
| 2:02:59| Well, Commissioner Lambert has a point about going too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| But if we do this and we lose the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7383)|
| 2:03:09| then I just think it might be prudent to defer this for 30 days to investigate this a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7389)|
| 2:03:18| I can go along with you on that, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| Here's the thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| Whoa, whoa, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| We have a, go ahead, Daniels, Commissioner Daniels next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| You know, and Chairman Moore, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| I'm not no chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| I mean, sorry, Commissioner Moore and Herman as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7413)|
| 2:03:40| I guess the thing that, you know, we paid $800,000 commission on a deal on Midway that you're wanting to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7420)|
| 2:03:49| You know, paid $800,000 commission on a piece of agricultural property that had cows on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:58| You know, one of the things that has disturbed me is that when we don't like something, we want to renegotiate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7438)|
| 2:04:07| You know, and I come from the procurement world years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| And, you know, your credibility is based upon you doing what you say you'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7452)|
| 2:04:18| And this is a classic example of, and I'm in real estate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7458)|
| 2:04:23| You know, when you work out a deal, you know, it doesn't matter if it takes five minutes or it takes five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7463)|
| 2:04:31| The commission rate is set on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| It isn't set on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| Yes, there is no doubt that some of those rates are negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7475)|
| 2:04:39| But you typically don't wait until you have a contract signed in hand and then go and renegotiate the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7479)|
| 2:04:46| And I just think it sends a bad signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| You know, we've done that on insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| You know, and we've looked at other things as well that I just think that it doesn't send a good signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7492)|
| 2:05:00| And somebody made the comment earlier this evening that, you know, if you don't like a deal, you just come to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| you try to get the deal changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| And I think, again, this is another one of those examples that it sends a bad signal to the community that if you don't like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7507)|
| 2:05:15| bring it back up and we'll cut the rate or we'll cut another deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7515)|
| 2:05:23| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Commissioner, I'm going to go back to a comment that Commissioner Mark Harmon made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| You said it came up at intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| And you said you had talked with Mr. Troyer and he said he didn't think it would affect the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| Did I understand you to say that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| That's what I understood from my conversation with John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| John, when you came up to the podium, you said, Commissioner, go ahead with your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| Now, that sends a signal to me that you think this would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| I mean, am I reading that right or wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| Commissioner Harmon asked about it and asked how much the appropriate level of the brokerage fee should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7550)|
| 2:05:57| And I'm not an expert on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| He did mention it at committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| We have talked about it this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| So, you know, to me it's a commission decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| But do you think this will kill it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| I have not spoken to the broker, so I don't know if this will kill the deal or it will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| I guess I could go along with a postponement and let you talk with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| I mean, but, you know, hey, if I'm sitting there, I'm saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| Well, I don't know that you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7584)|
| 2:06:25| I want my whole commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7585)|
| 2:06:26| So I'm in agreement with Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| I think if this is reasonable and you think it's reasonable, then I think that that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| Well, Commissioner Hanson, I don't think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| As the broker, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| Why is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| Here's the thing about this, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| This is not costing Knox County anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| This broker, who I don't know, and everybody knows I'm tight on money up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| he's come forward with a customer and he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| I can rent this space for you for X amount of dollars for 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7616)|
| 2:07:04| We've made that agreement with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| Now, here's the thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| Starting last week, the intergovernmental, if I had been the salesman on this, when this come up for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7629)|
| 2:07:18| the first thing I would have started doing if I had been that salesman would be hunting another place to put Verizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7638)|
| 2:07:26| I definitely would be, if I have a contract with Verizon, five years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7646)|
| 2:07:32| when this is up, I would have another place for my client to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| We can cost Knox County a half a million dollars right here for $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7656)|
| 2:07:42| Now, business is business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| Now, I'll tell you, I'm not the smartest guy up here, but I know how to make money in my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7664)|
| 2:07:51| I made it for 32 years and made a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| And this is business right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| Anytime you can get $500,000 for $24,000, that's a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7675)|
| 2:08:04| Well, I tell you, the lights went out after that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| Just a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| Commissioner Pinkston, these folks have been here for I don't know how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| I think they were here before the last contract, five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| So he didn't bring us a customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| The customer has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Now, I'm sure as big as the company is, as this is, if they went to them and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7701)|
| 2:08:26| hey, guys, this commission is wanting to cut your commission, I'm sure they're going to say that's probably okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7706)|
| 2:08:33| Because I've got a house just sold this week, and I had to go to my realtor and say, hey, can you take 2% less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7713)|
| 2:08:40| They come back and said, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| But, you know, you went to the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| We questioned the insurance, and we got better insurance today because we did question it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| One policy had a $20,000 deductible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| I think it was a mistake, but we corrected it because we asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| No one ever asked this commission about 6% until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7736)|
| 2:09:02| So, you know, I think, you know, it's up to us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| And, you know, we've talked about wanting to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| Commissioner Moore, you know for a fact that he didn't bring this people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| I don't know how long Verizon has been over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7756)|
| 2:09:17| Do you know for a fact he didn't bring them to PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| Well, they were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| It was MCI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| It was MCI before it was Verizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| They were here, I think, before the last contract, five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| But we don't know whether this is the gentleman that brought them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| I'm sure it's probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| It's probably just the same company that they used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| John, would I be correct that we're losing $12,000 if we defer for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| The contract expires August 31st, and so we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| So if we defer 30 days, we've lost $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| I think it would be best to just make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| John Owings, Mr. Owings, Lyle Director, a contract is between two parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7793)|
| 2:09:59| No matter what we vote on tonight, then if he doesn't agree to come back to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| we've lost $12,000 come September if we have to pass the $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7804)|
| 2:10:10| If we change the contract, though, which includes this brokerage fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| they don't have to agree to it and we still lose the $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| That's the point that I'm making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| The contract is between two parties, not with what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| If we delay 30 days or longer, then we've lost $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:28| It may be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| I mean, this contract expires Sunday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| So, you know, a split commission, I think, out in the real estate world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| three and three percent is generally customary, and we got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| You know, I'm not going to support Mark on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| I'm going to go with the original motion if it gets that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| We have a substitute motion on the floor not to exceed $10,000 on the brokerage fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7848)|
| 2:10:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| I'm sure we're going to have to have a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7863)|
| 2:11:08| Mr. McKibbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| Does everyone understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part2?start=7869)|
