| 2:39:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| Good, good, well thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9552)|
| 2:39:22| Okay, your office is in the construction zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9562)|
| 2:39:26| Yes, fourth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9566)|
| 2:39:27| Where do I, how do I get to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| Just go to the fourth floor and, and uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| He's not, there's to be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9574)|
| 2:39:35| It's 360, you can't, there's, there's a lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9575)|
| 2:39:40| Can I go through that hallway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9582)|
| 2:39:43| He'll look down for your shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| Okay, okay, that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9586)|
| 2:40:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9609)|
| 2:40:39| Council, we will, for those waiting for public forum, thank you for still being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9639)|
| 2:40:57| We have four people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9657)|
| 2:41:03| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| The first is Keith Britt, then Ryan Roloff, David Hayes, and Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9665)|
| 2:41:14| Mr. Britt, please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| Keith Britt, 558 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9679)|
| 2:41:22| I've previously come to City Council about the lack of a sufficient maternity leave policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9682)|
| 2:41:31| I've just come back with some math for you, just to understand how affordable that can actually be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9691)|
| 2:41:36| And just as a reminder, my wife is a City of Knoxville employee with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9696)|
| 2:41:41| We'll be having triplets soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| I don't expect for any of this to get passed before, to benefit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| It's just to benefit people in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| And all this math and my remarks, I'd be happy to distribute after, after adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9710)|
| 2:41:55| Actually, Mr. Britt, I would ask you to send all of the stuff, like you've stated before in this math, send it directly to my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9715)|
| 2:42:03| That's really the best way to get something like this looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| Absolutely, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9726)|
| 2:42:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9727)|
| 2:42:08| The City of Knoxville employs approximately 1,500 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| Approximately 20 percent of those employees are women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| For my analysis, we considered that all City employees work a 30-year career, beginning at age 20 and ending at age 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9734)|
| 2:42:20| We used an annual average salary and compensation package value of $55,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9740)|
| 2:42:26| We used the United States average birth rate of 1.8 births per woman's lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9746)|
| 2:42:31| And we made the assumption that all births occur in the first 15 years of an employee's career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| Using this math to budget for a maternity leave program that offers women 12 weeks of paid maternity leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9756)|
| 2:42:46| it would cost the city roughly $457,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| I stress that's a ceiling expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| That's, and this is a new economic term that I just made up, that this is the most expensive reasonable scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9773)|
| 2:43:01| Yeah, I hate to compare apples to oranges, but I've seen a lot of line items come through City Council that were far more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9781)|
| 2:43:10| and I would argue far less important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9790)|
| 2:43:14| There's no question in my mind that the City Council should do this just because it's the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9794)|
| 2:43:19| but I would also argue that it would be an extremely valuable recruiting tool for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9799)|
| 2:43:25| We're in need of a lot of young, talented women, and I think this type of policy would be of great benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9805)|
| 2:43:33| Just for comparison, surrounding major, well, not surrounding, but major Tennessee City maternity leave policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9813)|
| 2:43:40| Chattanooga, Johnson City, Memphis, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| Just like Knoxville, Nashville has six weeks of paid maternity leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9823)|
| 2:43:49| This is a rudimentary analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| This requires a lot more vigor and access to data that I just don't have, but I've met with the employee benefit staff recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9831)|
| 2:43:59| I've got to tell you, I'm really impressed with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9839)|
| 2:44:04| They are way more than competent, and given the go-ahead by this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9844)|
| 2:44:10| I'm sure they could put together some accurate numbers and policy workflow for you in short order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9850)|
| 2:44:19| Yes, thank you for your time, and I'd be happy to take questions after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9859)|
| 2:44:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| Okay, now Mr. Ryan Roloff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| Thank you for being here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| My name is Ryan Roloff, 1612 East Glenwood here in Knoxville, 37917, and thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9876)|
| 2:44:43| I'm coming to you tonight as the president of the local ATU, Amalgamated Transit Union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9883)|
| 2:44:49| which represents all CAT drivers, trolley drivers, service and maintenance personnel here in the CAT operating system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9889)|
| 2:44:57| As president of the local union, I'm here to make you all aware, assuming that you are, that CAT operates as a union shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9897)|
| 2:45:05| and we are currently in a negotiation process with CATrans or CAT, the company that we work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9905)|
| 2:45:14| If every three years we update, change, amend, improve our current working contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9914)|
| 2:45:23| I'm here actually to let you know that we're in the negotiation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| The current contract expired on July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| It's not unusual that negotiations continue after an expiration of a current contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9930)|
| 2:45:39| What is unusual this year is that the company has not responded to our offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9939)|
| 2:45:44| and our request for a contract extension agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9944)|
| 2:45:49| I feel that's important because a contract extension agreement is important for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9949)|
| 2:45:55| because we continue to get our guaranteed wages, benefits, and guaranteed working conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9955)|
| 2:46:01| It's important for the KTA board, the city council, the city of Knoxville, and all of the people who use the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9961)|
| 2:46:09| because if you are operating under a current agreement, that guarantees no slowdowns, no sit-downs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9969)|
| 2:46:17| no sick-outs, or ultimately a system stoppage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9977)|
| 2:46:23| We made a request to the company at our negotiating table for a contract extension agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9983)|
| 2:46:31| with the known percentage increase that was not a hidden factor of the 2.5 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9991)|
| 2:46:39| that was going to go to all the city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| We asked that they enact the 2.5 because we know that's a common number that we're going to be dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10002)|
| 2:46:47| And those of us that operate at top rate have not had a pay increase in over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10007)|
| 2:46:53| We've had one pay increase in 25 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10013)|
| 2:46:56| So we were asking that the company enact what we expected the city to be giving, the 2.5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10016)|
| 2:47:03| and extend to us a contract extension agreement that we can operate under the expired and existing contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10023)|
| 2:47:11| for a certain period of time until the new contract is completely done and negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10031)|
| 2:47:17| I'm here tonight just to advise you of that status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| So we are currently working without a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| That is the major moral underlying point that I'm wanting to get across tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10044)|
| 2:47:32| I made the same presentation at the KTA board with our director present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10052)|
| 2:47:38| and expressed my concerns in a similar manner at that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10058)|
| 2:47:43| and offered the union's position that that day, that time, at the conclusion of that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10063)|
| 2:47:51| we are willing to ink and sign a contract extension agreement immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10071)|
| 2:47:57| It was answered with no comment from our director and no response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10077)|
| 2:48:03| much like the request in our negotiating process where we made the initial request early in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10083)|
| 2:48:10| We asked for a contract extension agreement at that time in the negotiating process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10090)|
| 2:48:14| when they were represented by council and we were represented by our international vice president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10094)|
| 2:48:20| from the Amalgamated Transit Union out of Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10100)|
| 2:48:24| Again, that request by the company was not honored or responded other than just denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10104)|
| 2:48:32| So really it's just in the effort of being transparent and making sure that everyone in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10112)|
| 2:48:43| that has their hand in transit is aware of the current status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| And that's really all I was here tonight to do is to make you aware of that status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| We're hoping to resolve the negotiations soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| That will ultimately end the situation that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10134)|
| 2:48:58| But the refusal, like previous years, of offering a contract extension, we don't understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10138)|
| 2:49:05| We did one three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| We did one three years before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| But for some reason the company is not willing to do that this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| and I just wanted to make that status aware to all parties that may have an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10152)|
| 2:49:18| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10158)|
| 2:49:19| Thank you very much for your time tonight and for the folks that hung around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10159)|
| 2:49:23| Thank you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10163)|
| 2:49:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10164)|
| 2:49:25| Verify for council that by law, and I may be simplifying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10165)|
| 2:49:36| municipalities in Tennessee cannot negotiate and sign union contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10176)|
| 2:49:42| And so the way this CAT is structured is that CAT employees are actually employees of CATRIANS, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10182)|
| 2:49:53| And so we have an arm's length from that in terms of my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10193)|
| 2:50:00| But anyway, thank you for bringing our attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| Next is David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| Mr. Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| Please again state your name and address for the record and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10210)|
| 2:50:13| Thanks for sticking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10213)|
| 2:50:16| 1312 Hawthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10216)|
| 2:50:18| First off, solidarity with the workers in CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10218)|
| 2:50:23| I think anything the city can do to support the workers in getting a contract, a good, fair contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10223)|
| 2:50:29| whatever official or unofficial routes that can be taken, I think you all should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10229)|
| 2:50:34| And I just want to say to somebody in the community, whatever workers need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10234)|
| 2:50:38| I'll give you my e-mail and, you know, whatever you can do to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10238)|
| 2:50:43| Today was a lot, definitely with the folks from Pond Gap coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10243)|
| 2:50:49| I think it speaks to some larger crises we're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10249)|
| 2:50:53| There's the public, there's the affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10253)|
| 2:50:57| Affordable housing crisis in which most people, a lot of people, I feel comfortable saying most people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10257)|
| 2:51:03| a lot of people are not going to struggle with housing, struggle to be able to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10263)|
| 2:51:07| I think if it's over 30 percent of your income that goes to housing, it's like a measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10267)|
| 2:51:13| That's a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| But it also speaks to a deeper problem of a poverty crisis, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| And that's something that goes, that the city is partly complicit in, but not fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10279)|
| 2:51:28| But on the affordable housing tip, I think it's something to note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| that while the city is only spending $10 million for affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| that was a number that was given by the mayor, that includes everything that the city budget goes into for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10296)|
| 2:51:44| There's always going to be conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10304)|
| 2:51:48| There's always going to be problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| There's never going to be enough money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| There's never going to be enough done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10311)|
| 2:51:52| So in instances where there's like a spot where there's an opportunity to put affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10312)|
| 2:51:57| and then the folks around there are like, no, that actually is not what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10317)|
| 2:52:02| It's a difficult situation because if you don't approve that, then where is it going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10322)|
| 2:52:07| Is there an option anywhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| There's not enough money, not enough resources going into making sure that there's enough housing for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10328)|
| 2:52:15| But also I think there's another crisis to speak to, and that's the crisis of democracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10335)|
| 2:52:19| the crisis of people actually not having a voice in the local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| I mean, those folks who came, there was definitely some folks in there who was just like, oh, I just don't want more poor people around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10344)|
| 2:52:29| I definitely wouldn't be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| But like a lot of folks, what they were saying was not necessarily they didn't want more working class people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10350)|
| 2:52:35| It was how the whole thing was going about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| It was where it was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10358)|
| 2:52:39| That speaks to an issue in our democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10359)|
| 2:52:41| That speaks to people actually not having a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10361)|
| 2:52:43| That speaks to people not actually having control over the community around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| Because if we had a real commitment to people's voices being heard in the city process, in affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10367)|
| 2:52:52| just in general city planning, at that point, the conversations with those folks wouldn't have got to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10372)|
| 2:52:59| We could have had crucial conversations with folks who would be like, okay, maybe this spot doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10379)|
| 2:53:03| but this area still needs affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| What are other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| What are other ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| What are other investments we can make to make sure that people can afford the houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10387)|
| 2:53:10| So I think a much radical view of democracy and how people's voices can be heard from earlier in, like much earlier in the processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10390)|
| 2:53:20| I heard there was community meetings and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| But actual meetings where we know people who are actually affected and living there are actually involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10402)|
| 2:53:27| actually investing in having processes and people's voices being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10407)|
| 2:53:31| So when it comes to something, when things come to city council, you don't have things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10411)|
| 2:53:35| If you actually had avenues that people could participate in and participate in how the money is structured and how things are done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10415)|
| 2:53:41| then we wouldn't get to this point because people already have their voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10421)|
| 2:53:45| But we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10425)|
| 2:53:46| Democracy barely exists in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10426)|
| 2:53:49| You know, the $377 million net that you have, that money should be decided on by more than just a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10429)|
| 2:53:57| It should be a city thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10437)|
| 2:53:58| It should be a public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| It should be something the public should contribute to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| And as long as the public is not able to participate fully in the budgeting process, in the priorities, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10441)|
| 2:54:08| so instead of police getting like $55 million in affordable housing and $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10448)|
| 2:54:14| or $93 million counting the police station, instead of having these different disruptances, whatever, you know, disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10454)|
| 2:54:23| actually including people's voice, we wouldn't have these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| We would have the right sort of prioritization, the right things, getting the right money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| and then things like this wouldn't happen because people's voices would be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| and affordable housing would be something that we cared about enough to make sure it was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10471)|
| 2:54:36| regardless if one spot doesn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10476)|
| 2:54:38| Because if that spot doesn't work out, it doesn't mean that community shouldn't have more affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10478)|
| 2:54:42| It just means it should go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10482)|
| 2:54:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10485)|
| 2:54:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10486)|

| 2:55:11| I was just talking to Councilwoman McKenzie earlier just to give her a heads up that I was going to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10511)|
| 2:55:18| October 16th, 8.30 in the morning at the CAC East Annex at the Holston Shopping Center area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10518)|

| 2:55:30| Recode meeting, informational meeting for the Five Points community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10530)|
| 2:55:38| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| Five Points community, way outside Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10540)|
| 2:55:46| Let's put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10546)|
| 2:55:49| Doesn't come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10549)|
| 2:55:53| There are many locations within the Five Points community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10553)|
| 2:55:57| We have enough churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| We have a public housing Boys and Girls Club available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10559)|
| 2:56:08| You can come to St. Luke's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10568)|
| 2:56:11| Hey, we'll fit everybody in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10571)|
| 2:56:14| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10574)|
| 2:56:15| On Chestnut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| Smack dab in the heart of Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10577)|
| 2:56:20| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| This is a disempowerment situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10582)|
| 2:56:27| Historically, people in the Five Points community have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10587)|
| 2:56:32| I mean, David just talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10592)|
| 2:56:37| They're not empowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10599)|
| 2:56:40| Right now, decisions are being made about how land and property is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10600)|
| 2:56:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10606)|
| 2:56:47| We're talking about a dearth of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10607)|
| 2:56:53| Don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10613)|
| 2:56:54| Yeah, we've got Cherokee bringing in a healthcare facility, which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10614)|
| 2:57:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| The redevelopment of KCDC, Walter B. Taylor Homes, and Willie Williams, and the residences at Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10621)|
| 2:57:10| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10630)|
| 2:57:11| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| But, again, the way I look at it is, you know, Five Points area is one of the highest rental areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10633)|
| 2:57:21| even though it is subsidized, it's still one of the highest rental areas in Knoxville, percentage-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10641)|
| 2:57:28| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| Ownership is going down the tubes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10649)|
| 2:57:33| And there's no effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10653)|
| 2:57:34| I mean, I can't even go to an informational meeting on RECODE, and I'll bring up one subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10654)|
| 2:57:40| I'll bring up land trusts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| I get three different stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| You witnessed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10667)|
| 2:57:48| You witnessed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10668)|
| 2:57:50| Different stories every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| So let's schedule a meeting that's going to talk about how people's communities are going to be structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10674)|
| 2:58:02| in the community concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| I would ask you to relocate from the CAC office on Asheville Highway to a location in Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10685)|
| 2:58:18| And let's start to think in terms of empowering the people in the communities that really don't have a voice at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10698)|
| 2:58:25| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10705)|
| 2:58:26| Because right now, think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10706)|
| 2:58:29| Barely a healthcare facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| We don't have a grocery store to think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| It's still a food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| And, Mayor, you know you got me on to the Food Policy Council, and you know I've dealt with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10715)|
| 2:58:40| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10720)|
| 2:58:41| And I've raised my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10724)|
| 2:58:45| And it's going up against literally a sound-absorbing retaining wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10725)|
| 2:58:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| No one's listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| No one's shown me anything that says, hey, you know, we're actually trying to recruit or maybe bring in a different model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10735)|
| 2:59:04| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10744)|
| 2:59:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10745)|
| 2:59:06| A different model of how to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| On the Food Policy Council, we did a study about food security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10750)|
| 2:59:17| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10757)|
| 2:59:19| And you wouldn't have believed the range of answers of how to get people good quality food, fresh food, into their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10759)|
| 2:59:36| And we haven't seen any of those models that we brought forth that we surveyed all the different principles in the food chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10776)|
| 2:59:46| None of that information has come back and been implemented within the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10786)|
| 2:59:51| So let's start doing the right thing first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10791)|
| 2:59:54| Let's have a recode meeting, informational meeting, in the community that you want to inform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10794)|
| 3:00:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| Within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| So people don't have to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=10803)|
