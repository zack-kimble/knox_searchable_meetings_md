| 0:00:50| All five members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| Great, thank you all for being here and being here on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| Do we have any amendments or additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| With none, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| Do I have a proper motion for the approval of the minutes from the previous meeting on October 25th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| With a proper motion and a second, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| Do we have anyone here for public comment on any agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| It doesn't appear that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| Is there any discussion or consideration of any late additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| Seeing none, moving on to our first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| Discussion and consideration of including work session in Rule 1, Board of Commissioners, Section A, and D in the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| Let's move on over to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| This is simply just adding the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| It was brought to our attention, I think, by Commissioner Jay that said the rules should also apply for the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=103)|
| 0:01:52| It's literally just adding work session to convening the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=112)|
| 0:01:59| Do I have a proper motion to include work session in Section A and D in the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Are you moving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| Just for clarity, what is the title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| It talks about the regular meetings of commission and zoning, but it doesn't include the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=137)|
| 0:02:27| And so the rules still apply for work session as well as regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| Which section are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| Page 1, Rule 1, Section A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| There is a separate paragraph about the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| I don't know where it's in page 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| What page is that, Jill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| I'm not exactly sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| I know that it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| Did I really bring this up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| I made a note of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| It says agenda work session on Section U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| Each month the commission shall meet for agenda work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=184)|
| 0:03:11| It does have a section, Section U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| Page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| It's Monday when we fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| And Section A talks about when the commission meets the fourth Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| Just to be clear, what exactly would I be adding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| I'm not still sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| Convening the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| I think it was just that this Section A talked about the regular meeting of convening the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=218)|
| 0:03:45| And there was discussion if we needed to also include under convening the commission including work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=225)|
| 0:03:53| If you think Section U covers that, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| I had just a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| We're still under Rule 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| We just move it up and combine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Take U and stick it up into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| I'm going to make it more clear to kind of just put them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| We convene and we do this on this day or some other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| What is the purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| Just to include convening the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| In the first Section A, it only addresses the regular meeting of commission and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| And then there's a separate section for a general work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| I think just combining them into A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| So basically leaving Section U and combining the language of A just makes it cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| So I would propose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| And then to whatever was put on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Is that legit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| So I would move U after Section A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| I would have a space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Some of the language is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| I think you can combine them into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| Basically, we meet this time for the same reason and this time for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| So Section A, convening the commission, would just have a blurb about the regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| and then a blurb about the work session under Section A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| And that we could just delete Section U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| So Section U will be deleted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| I think we can incorporate it into A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| So do we have a motion to delete Section U| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| and add a paragraph under Section A, convening the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| to include work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Do I need to just amend the motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| Or yes, somebody put that out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Who had the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Oh, Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Eric, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| So I will amend my motion to delete Section U| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| and include the language in Section U regarding commission's work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| into Section A, Rule 1, Section A, convening the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=363)|
| 0:06:13| Do I have a proper motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| I have a proper second by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| And it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Moving on to number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| So Commissioner Oster had brought this forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| which we failed to add that on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| A discussion and consideration amending the structure of an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| to the beer board in Rule 5, committee's K beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| As you'll see, Section K talks about the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| Section N also references that the beer board is not considered a standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| So you received a handout that basically highlighted the county beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| and board membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| So the county legislative body may appoint a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=428)|
| 0:07:16| Commissioner Oster, did you want to talk about why you wanted this on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| agenda and just see if you can't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| I think it's just if we're going to have the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| then if you're going to be a part of the revocation and the punishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| you need to be a part of approving the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| Because I feel like that there's a look there that if you don't want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| a part of approving it and you're a part of the punishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| I don't think it comes across very fair to the applicants when that period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| And so that was my whole point about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| I feel like you need to be all in or you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| And so we can do this as a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| And just like we do at RE-ORG, we want to appoint members who want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| And I think that works great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| And then that way everybody is involved and participates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| And that is the option that we're considering on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| Because it's not considered a standing committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| we can alter the structure of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| And what Commissioner Oster and I are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| is that it becomes a part of RE-ORG every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| That we need to determine the number on the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| because that would be reduced, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| There are several commissioners that probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| would not want to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| So that's the consideration on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| So is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Yeah, I have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| So if that's the case, it would just be structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| as a separate committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| You would still, instead of having the vice chair automatically become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| the chair of that board, well, I guess you could still keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| You'd probably have to do a vice chair and a chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| just like you do for your other committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| Would we look at a minimum number of required members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| That's why we have our law department here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| So just to talk about what that might look like if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| were to restructure, if it would become a body of seven, nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| it would fall into the RE-ORG, not a standing committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| terms of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| What if you've got seven, eight people on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| because of religious reasons don't want to be on the beer board then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| I don't see how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| I don't see the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| I don't see the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| And I think because of that reason, then you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| going to make a rule that you may not possibly be able to adhere to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| How many people do you have to have on a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| How many people make a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Well, the beer board, you have to have a beer board under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| if it's a board not a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| And it can be the entire legislative body, which we presently have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| or the body can create who they want or how they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| to make appointments to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| As I sit here, I don't have the statute in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| and I don't know if there's a minimum or maximum number you can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| The only thing I know for sure it says is that the entire legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| body can serve as a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| But we've got to have a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| And it's not, quote, a committee, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| although they have a lot of the same appointment procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| And the statute says that the statute do not establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| who will serve on the beer board, how many members the board will have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| a term of office for board members, or whether the members of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| will be compensated, which is unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| Well, that speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| So you can do what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| I think that point is also, if you do have religious beliefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| I appreciate that and I respect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| But it doesn't look, I feel like, to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| and to the constituents and applicants fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| if there are particular districts who have a religious belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| and not have an alcohol, which I think we all respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| But I'm not sure that you can come in and then also provide a punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| If you don't believe in it, period, I just don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| that you should be involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| And that's why this committee makes it really easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| because then that just takes somebody who is religiously against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| You don't even have to participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| They don't put you in any kind of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| So to me, that seems a little bit fair for the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| and better for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| That's kind of my point of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| You make a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| I mean, when something comes up in the 8th district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| and somebody makes a motion because Commissioner Beals is against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| or the 9th district because Commissioner Carson Bailey doesn't believe in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| We respect their opinions and beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| But it kind of looks squirrely just in that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| That, oh, I'm not going to vote on it or I'm not going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| So I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| And we could consider maybe a five-member board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| I mean, I think that that would be adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| I don't think it's districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| I mean, I don't think the districts mean as much on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| versus a zoning or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| We don't really make the determination of anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| other than did you take the oath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Did you file paperwork?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Did you do the right things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| And following up, I'm sure there's some movement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| Probably got a lot of people in the 8th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| We see it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| It's more income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| It's more business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| We don't want him to be shamed in his district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| because he just happens to not believe in alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| I mean, I understand all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| So is there a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| I don't think the districts make so much business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| like they do in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| It does have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Well, you're not voting on whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| you can have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| I mean, I don't understand the argument at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| They can always abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| I mean, you can abstain from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| And I haven't paid attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| If something's in the 9th district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| makes a motion for cars and bathing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| I don't remember whether cars and passes or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| I mean, from what I can understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| and what I remember in paying attention at meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| the people who don't vote to give the beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| they all vote to give the punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| In all those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| And sometimes make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| And that's where, typically, they do make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| But when the beer license is in 7, 8, and 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| that could change next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Who knows what districts are going to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| But then it puts Commissioner Frazier and Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| Jay into having to approve those for those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| But when that applicant comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| their commissioner didn't approve their beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| but they're punishing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| And that's where I've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| You have defined what the punishment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| But you're still not being a part of the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| You see, that'll be a prediction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| It's a contradiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| That's just where I feel strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Because I really don't feel like it's fair to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| So basically, the only thing that's being proposed to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| is that we're just changing it to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| that the entire commission is on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| We're still going to have a beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| but it has five members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| And each year, they'll choose its own chair and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| So it's determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| If you want to serve on it, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| And if you don't want to, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| But still, what are you going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| if you've got, then, the majority of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| who don't support that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| And you don't have your five or your committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| And what are you going to come and do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Change the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| That's why we have a rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| We meet every quarter to adjust the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| And if somebody drops off the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| then you can add somebody at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| We can have this committee to tweak things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| And that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| This is discussion and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| And so what I would propose is that I take the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| and work with Jill and Dr. Boone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| You've been elevated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Director Boone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| And come back to the committee at the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| with a proposed structure change, the terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| if that's what you all decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| But I do think I do agree with Commissioner Oster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| that it is time to kind of look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| I mean, it's just been this way for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| And this is what the rules committee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| We look at our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| And we look at how things have evolved and changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| And I think it's worth the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| and explore our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| So does this benefit you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| Well, I know it's been brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| But I have received some emails about why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| do certain commissioners not grant their permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| And it seems to be a contradiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| And if they're required to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| you're actually not doing your duty or service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| by issuing the mere permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Because right now, the way it states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| is that it's all commissioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| And you have that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| And so some people are questioning, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| those commissioners that don't, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| not doing what we have elected them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| So it fits you all in kind of an awkward situation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| I mean, because you always have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| to abstain from a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| So is there, do we have a motion on the floor to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| We have a motion to present to the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| the restructuring of the theater board by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| It's coming back to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| It's coming back to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Who does that say in the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Do you want to move it forward to actually go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| work on some language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Second by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Moving on to number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| Are we looking at a particular page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| So discussion number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Discussion and consideration of viewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| the role, function, procedure, and structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| of county affiliated boards and committees in rule five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| which is committees and boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| So rule five is all committees and boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| so I didn't include a specific section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| But this is something that I know Commissioner Jay had even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| looked at this many years ago during his first term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| and something that I was interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| As you can see, I've had some great help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| from Jill and Mike Moyers and Mandy in the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| and Drew and Sharon in our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| trying to really combine and compile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| any sort of affiliated county board or committee that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| out there, whether it's on record, not on record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| whether we have any information on it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| But that's what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| That's what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| So the one that has red, this is from Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1197)|
| 0:20:06| The other is from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| We're also going to add a column about the authority, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| gives the body authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| But this isn't something that we can go through today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| So what I'm asking of you is to take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| and to go back and look at these boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| We are continuing to work with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| to help us identify the authority, which boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| and committees are required and mandated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| if they have bylaws and rules, if they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| The end goal is to make this a little bit neater and tidier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| and have this live in one place, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| because right now, Drew and Sharon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| have some notebooks with information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| about rules and bylaws and who's on the committee or board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| Jill has some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| The mayor's office has some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| So we're trying to just kind of compile everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| so that all the records are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| And then what we'll do is, once we've done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| is hopefully reach out to them and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| here's a standard set of bylaws and rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| that you do have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| Also, a copy of the Knox County Ethics Policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| because our policy states that all county boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| and committees follow the code of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| And then also the attendance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| So as you can see, there are a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| And we're also working through if some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| maybe could serve a different role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| or if some of them could be combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| And we'll know more once we kind of identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| which ones are mandated and we are required just to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| Like we were discussing the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| That's something that we have to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| but it only meets if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Well, we want that written out somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| So everything would have kind of a form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| of when it meets, the structure of the body, the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1350)|
| 0:22:37| We went through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| We said the book had like one sheet for every committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| It had one single sheet that had all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| That's what we want to update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| So that still exists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| Did you say that the one in red is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| This is from Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| I think Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Or Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| OK, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| I had some other changes we just had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| OK, so this one's from Drew and this one's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| So we're just trying to compile, get a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| So again, what I'm asking is for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| to just take a look at this and if you're in support of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1395)|
| 0:23:24| If you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| I do it like every year, honestly, or every other year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| I mean, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| I mean, it is surprising how many we have and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| Director Booth, Jill, do you all have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| to add to the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1421)|
| 0:23:53| And again, this is also to reach out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| and at least establish a standard set of bylaws and rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| that are inclusive of the code of ethics policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| and attendance policy, which I feel is pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| And right now, we don't know if they do, don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| But our rules state that all boards and committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| follow those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| So that's the intent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| So do I have a motion on the floor to continue the work of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1462)|
| 0:24:30| Gosh, how do you even say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| Cleaning up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Cleaning up, reviewing, and updating boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| We have a motion by Derrick, a second by Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Moving on to number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Discussion and consideration of adding section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| view and attendance policies to rule five committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| and boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| And we have two sheets of paper here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| One is I drafted an attendance policy, which is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| And I just wanted to include kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| of our discussion of possible changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| And then the other sheet is kind of the final change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| with one last suggestion to strike a sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| So I just wanted you all to see the discussion we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| had back and forth with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| So this is the final?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| So this is the final with the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| of striking one sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| So this is something that we would add under the section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| of boards and committees so that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| is a standard attendance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Do you already exist as a photographic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Section view is not kind of photographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| under boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Are you adding to it, or are we going to do a whole new section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| No, that might just be an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| It is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| It's page 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| So it would be B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| B, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| As in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| That is a correction then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Section B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| As in Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| He's always in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Is there a motion to approve the proposed attendance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| with striking the suggested sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| and adding section B, attendance policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| to rule by committees and boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| So before we make a motion, because I intend to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| but just give a brief overview of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| So as you know, we've had attendance issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| with some of the boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| We want to offer all boards and committees a standard policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| And you'll see that it's pretty standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| I mean as far as other boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| But just if you are unable to, 75% of the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| attend 75% of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| And then the chair would ask you to step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| So it's up to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| It's up to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| It's decided if it's excused or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| The chair of that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| The chair of the committee or board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| And you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| And we kind of broke it down further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Monthly, quarterly, biannually, just to give them some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| I'd appreciate it if you'd share your experience that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| brought this to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| Well, it started with BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| And I know that we corrected that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| But then when I started looking at the boards and committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| I also realized that one, some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| didn't have published bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| The other is that we're not aware if folks are even meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1675)|
| 0:28:04| if they're even attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| So this was really, again, just to clean up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| our boards and committees and give a little bit more structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| If you're going to be appointed or serve on a board committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| attendance is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| So it's also just a little nudge for those boards and committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| that isn't required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| Is it also required for all the boards and committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| and not standing to take the ethics class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| And we don't have a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Yeah, that's under the ethics code, not under the ethics system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| It's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| But under the ethics code, everybody, everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| has to take that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Who has that class here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Anyone down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Oh, Anthony Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| He does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| There's probably some of them that have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| And they haven't been doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| That's a recent one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| We want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| We'll be having that in Florence, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| That's a promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| For instance, I serve on the Three Ridges golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| When I came on board that Three Ridges golf board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| they had not been able to approve their minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| for the past 18 months because they did not have a forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| So I asked them about their bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| And I said, well, it's in our bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| that that person should be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| They hadn't followed their bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| They didn't have their minutes policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Why do they have a board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Why do they have a board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| It's a Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Well, Parks and Rec is on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| That's a good question to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| And that, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| You look on your board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| As you guys know, I've been asking everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| to figure it out for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| And nobody can quite tell me why we still have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| But I think that's part of what we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| I don't know why Three Ridges would need a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| It's a Parks and Rec operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| It's managed by the Parks and Rec Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| The Parks and Rec has an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| So you have a double board for one entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| What's the purpose of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| So I just wonder if it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| And are we going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Or maybe that's not part of this attendance question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| It's value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| What do we talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Do we need these or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| And that's going back to our discussion of boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| That's what I'm asking from you all, to go back and look at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| and then provide your input and feedback so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| can take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| And again, that includes when we do get to standard bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| that we have to put out, it will include attendance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| And it will include the Knox County Code of Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| So yes, for multiple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Quorums, accountability, and just also finding out some of the boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| and committees out that maybe don't have that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| Is it not bothering anybody, but is it concerning to anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| that we have an attendance policy for commission committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| but there's no attendance policy for commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| You can be elected and show up four years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| and be on the show four years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| I guess there's a way you can do a recall petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| No, you have to be an officer under the officer's badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Yeah, so I mean, there's no attendance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| But I mean, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Yeah, and that's not something that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| treated as a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| No, if you're elected, you should be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| And the only way you can get four or five offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| is through the state's officer's badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I thought that we had heard that in training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| when we got on at the state level and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| you know, the commissioner doesn't actually work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| to one meeting every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| And that's kind of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| If I may, Madam Chair, Director Booth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| is it within the commission's authority to, like on this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| to just dissolve boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| What would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| That's what the chairman was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| If you go down the list, you've got things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| that are required under statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Yeah, I understand those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Then you've got those that are done by ordinance, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| would take, you could get rid of it by repealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| the ordinance on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| And then a lot of them are just by resolution, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| obviously, you can change the resolution however you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| So it would actually take a written change of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| to some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| I was looking up trying to find the three ridges golf thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| I think the only thing that I, we used to go to those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| and nothing ever happened other than when the lease was up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| on the golf course, they wanted to just, and then bring you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| That's actually on our agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Commissioner Oster and I both serve on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| And we spend a lot of time talking about bunkers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| and irrigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| That's the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| You already used your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| I'm sure that there are lots of pressing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| My sons were right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| I texted my mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| There's a bunker that's over that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| Don't ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| So I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| I think we've been able to advise them on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| They didn't know that they can amend their own bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| if they needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| We helped them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| And then we included Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| We also brought on some folks from UT who this is what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| all day long is work in grasses, different kinds of grasses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| and how to be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| And then also just working with the director of Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| to help them identify when they need to start looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| kind of advocating for funds and improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| And also we've asked them to have a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| like what's an 18-month, two-year, three-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| to actually update the irrigation system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| and update the bunkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Which they should have anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Which they should have anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| So I think we've been able to, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| add to the conversation and the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| But...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| We're very well-rounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| We know more about golf now than we ever wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| But anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| So we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| It's going to be considered excused or excused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Well, that's why we kept it pretty open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| so that the chair could determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| and have a little bit of autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| Autonomy over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2115)|
| 0:35:25| Commissioner Lee asked about the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| excused versus unexcused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| And so we left that a little bit looser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| so that the chair could determine if it's excused or excused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| And that is pretty standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| for boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Can I ask a question, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| So if the rule committee makes a rule change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| does that have to go to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| So the commission votes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| So the rule committee could make a rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| and everything goes...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| It's a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| I have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| Motion on the floor to accept the attendance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| with the suggested changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| the document that you have before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| to recommend to commission to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| an attendance policy for boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| And that's section B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| Section B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| It's installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| We have a motion by Derrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| A second by Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| This was brought up at the last commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| Discussion and consideration of adding a rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| for the distribution and or acceptance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| of anonymous correspondence addressed to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| in Rule 6, Miscellaneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| Mr. Schoonmaker brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| We asked for the rules committee to have a discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| We don't have anything that addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| anonymous correspondence and how to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| I don't know that we need anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| but we were asked to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| I think the intention is that Drew and Sharon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| are really diligent about anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| that comes through to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| They don't play information police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| They don't decipher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| When it comes to commission, it gets distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| And you do get a lot of junk that just comes to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| that is not really decision-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| But I also think it, like what happened in the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| I think this was last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| where something came out right at the very end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| and it looked like it was from AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| But it put it in an anonymous source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| It did money the waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| So I'm comfortable putting something in rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| that just says any correspondence that comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| and deciphered to through commissioned members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| must be from an identifiable source of some case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| Now, it's still not going to close every loophole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| because somebody could still write a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| and say there's a letter from constituent Bob Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| who wanted to have a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| There really isn't one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| But I guess it would give them some direction on when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| without having to sort of go chair by chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| it would just give them some direction to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| they're not going to pass it along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| and maybe they'll just send it to the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| for review or report or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| I'm okay adding it as a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| I don't think it's hugely detrimental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| But the goal is to make this better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| for all future commissioners when they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| So it may be just helpful to kind of clean it up a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| I would say I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| At first, I was interested in also being a former chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| and you've dealt with the anonymous correspondence as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| I have a hard time stifling a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| that might not otherwise have gotten out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| because they're afraid of retribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| But at the same time, I think your idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| of giving it to the chair to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| whether it's distributed to commission or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| only if it's anonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| I think the default is anonymous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| but they should always share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| It should at least be shared to someone as a gatekeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| But it broke the discretion at a time last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| because they were rushing around at the last hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| printing all these pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Oh, they know and they can print it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| We didn't print it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| It was delivered like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| But we get those quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| We either get the tip of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| oh, you should look into this particular department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| because somebody's doing something illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| and then that usually gets forwarded to the audit department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| But it doesn't need to go to the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| because, again, it doesn't have a source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| or it's not related to an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| It's just political ammunition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| is mostly what it usually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| And you could take it a step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| It could be at the discretion of the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| but each commissioner can have the discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| to receive it or call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| I think it's a civil rule of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Well, I mean, if we're going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Well, at that point, if we're going to limit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| and then let each commissioner decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| then they've already received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| I think a civil rule would be to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| any correspondence delivered to the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| or to the commission email address or otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| that is anonymous will not be distributed to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| Will not automatically be distributed to commission members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| but will be forwarded to the chair for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Would you like to make that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| I would make that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Did everybody get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| We've got a recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| Yeah, yeah, we'll wait for maybe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| I could probably come up with it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| Yeah, we don't exactly know where to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2479)|

| 0:41:59| It was just thinking about the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| We have had this a couple of years Bgrgen in order to make a better measure out for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| commisioners..| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| through the Commission Office, but it came from the Commission Office, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| represents all of us, from the one Commission. And it turned out to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| fairly benign in the bigger sense, but it was one of those, it's information that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| out of the Commission Office, it needs to, there does need to be a gatekeeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| because it represents us all, and I think the Chair is probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| appropriate place to say, you know, I would like to convey this information on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| behalf of a commission like, for instance, the Junior Commissioner Program, we're sending out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| media releases, I'm copying the Chair, and we're sending them out as a, on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| Commission, we're doing this program, but I think we should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| something in there that basically says, like, individual commissioners, if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| going to use the Commission Office as a avenue to put out media releases, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| have to, yeah. Can you give me an example of it, like, without even names? Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| Okay. Well, it's out there. I mean, it is out there, the one release that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| made on, under one Commissioner's name, but sent out under the Office about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| specific opinion about the way that, you know. Well, it was one years ago, I think, I don't think any of you all were on the Commission before, this is like my first or second year that it was, the Commission put out a release that was like, we're going to celebrate this month, and yeah, yeah, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2599)|
| 0:43:41| then here's a bunch of people that helped, and like, none of us were on the forum, and it just came out, and we were like, oh, I didn't realize we were doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2621)|
| 0:43:50| Well, that's great if it's, maybe it's something simple, but maybe it's not. Maybe it's, you know, something really controversial. So that, I don't know if there's a rule right now, I just think that at some point this committee, this Rules Committee needs to kind of think about, like, what is the flow of information that goes out from an individual Commissioner versus the entire body? We also had a former Commissioner long, long ago, that would public notice every single event they ever went to, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2630)|
| 0:44:19| didn't need to be publicly noticed, but it was like, it wore this team out, and it was such-and-such is going to have lunch at noon on Thursday with such-and-such, and it had nothing to do with Commission business, but it was a way for that person to feel kind of more important, because it was always a release going about, like, here's all the things I'm doing in my life, and so I just think at some point we need to, we do need to sort of talk about what's the proper role of this office as a communications hub, versus what you might do individually, I mean, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2659)|
| 0:44:48| Commissioner can put out their own media release saying, you know, Commissioner Roser, I'm holding a press conference on, you know, purple butterflies on Tuesday, like, but it may not be on behalf of all of us. So, I don't have a solution right now, I just think that needs to be part of a future agenda where we kind of think through how do we use the office, and how do we not use the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2688)|
| 0:45:07| I can work with Dr. Booth and Jill on some language about communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| I'm sure she knows exactly what you're talking about, so she can probably answer better than that. This is pre-all of you, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2712)|
| 0:45:19| Which then I can bring back to the Canadian Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| Yeah, just think of something for the future. And then do we have a plan for when we will, like, go review all these to determine do we need these committees anymore or not, and is that, like, in April, the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2722)|
| 0:45:34| Well, that's what I was going to say. So, if we want to schedule the next meeting, I was looking at April or May, because that will give us time to kind of work on this with the law department and for it to be really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-231206?start=2734)|
