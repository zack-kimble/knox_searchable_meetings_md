| 0:04:42| Apologize. I noticed this as I was looking over the papers this afternoon and there's there's something quirky in one of the descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=282)|

| 0:13:57| Smells a little bit like hypocrisy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| well, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| Don't know how long mr. Adams has Adams has lived in Knoxville. I find it strange that shortly after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=843)|
| 0:14:13| The 10-year plan announced that they plans for opening a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| supportive housing unit in T berry it's about the time that much at least to my knowledge this proposal came out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| I I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| May be coincidence. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| Don't believe it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| It looks too much to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Like a plan to rezone all the parks to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| That there are no perm supportive housing units recommended for Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Now I can't prove that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| And mr. McAdams can't prove it isn't because which have to kind of look in his brain and we can't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=888)|
| 0:14:57| Now this I have the stated goal of this proposal is just fine by me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| It's the unstated goal that that bothers me the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| Application the stated goal would be if they 10-year plan did want to put permanent supportive housing in Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| Then after this they would have to have the black signs and the postcards. That's fine. I like that's no problem for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=914)|
| 0:15:22| My concern is that if that would work to happen that's points good then be able to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| Oh, but it's zoned OS 1 and having this zoned OS 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| Specifically for this purpose, even though including all the city parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| I'm I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| Don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| The 10-year plan is plant group is planning to put permanent supportive housing in Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| It's not a good location even according to their standards. They have said no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| You need available land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| the right zoning and close to a major grocery store, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| Sorry the other one. I missed credit close to public transportation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| There is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Grocery store is there and since most of people in permanent supportive housing aren't gonna have cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| It's gonna be very hard for them to get groceries. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| Lakeshore is not a good thing good location for from support of housing and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| The 10-year plans that was actually smart enough to realize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Now the minute I can't prove that it's purely conjecture my part one more minute. Mr. Garner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| But I don't think that's going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| So my concern is if that likely happens and they do propose one I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| Don't I don't want the opponents to be able to say oh, but it's always one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1009)|
| 0:16:58| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Don't see any need to change the proposal as it is. It's just that if that does happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| Keep ears open to see if people are saying things that make sound like this proposal has been designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1025)|
| 0:17:13| specifically to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| permanent supportive housing at Lakeshore and to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| That to review process at that point to go through them standard processes. That's all. Thank you partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| Vice mayor Beckham. Um, thank you. This isn't a question but to just start although I guess I did want to respond a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| It's interesting. Mr. Gartner. There's there's a level out there of well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| this is just about Lakeshore and the interesting part is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Or this is just about permanent supportive housing that OS one does allow permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| Multifamily housing is a permitted use there under a use on review and interestingly a lot of the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| We are rezoning are moving for places where permanent supportive housing couldn't be built because it's it's not allowed in any case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| To allow it in some cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| So it's an interesting sort of how we're how we're working at but I wanted to I wanted to move on a little bit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| This thing because at some level I don't quite understand why we're doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| But I have a lot of respect for the wisdom of my fellow council people and there's clearly a lot of support for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| so I'm willing to say there's something here that I don't get and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| We can we can move forward on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| I have some concerns about how it's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| Because my sense is if we're going to do this, we are passing law. We are putting something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| In concrete in the books and I'll make sure we do it the right way. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| Two sort of housekeeping amendments that I want to make one of them might not even need to be an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| and then some concerns the first one is just in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Section one of the ordinance we refer to exhibit one and the truth is it's exhibit a I think we're referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| And I don't know. Mr. Swanson. Should we have a clarifying amendment to change that here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| We'd already planned to make that change. Anyway, let me let me find to have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| I want to change exhibit one in section one to exhibit a to clarify that that's a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| Okay, any discussion on that all those in favor of changing exhibit one to exhibit a in section one nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| Those no, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| The second clarifying amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| I'd like to delete the last sentence of section one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Where it says with respect to all of these parcels of property being rezoned by this ordinance OS one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| No conditions prohibiting currently listed uses permitting on review shall be placed on the rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| And I'd like to do that because I think the intent of this is to say we're not putting any conditions on any zoning here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Didn't read it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| I actually read something significantly different that was allowing people to do things that we don't intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| and if we don't want to put conditions on we just don't put conditions on so I'd like to delete that last sentence and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| That is a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Any discussion on that mayor which last sentence are you talking section 1 page 4 section 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Respect to all of these parcels of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Councilman Roddy, is that you're coming on this or something else? Okay. Councilman. Don't vote me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| Pull your microphone that pull your microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| I was just going to ask someone who helped author that language to tell us what was intended by that provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| I'm not sure that I understand it. I did circle it in question mark on my own copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| mark, mr. Dawson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| We didn't actually draft the ordinance, but we were requested to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Placing conditions on the rezoning to restrict those uses that are listed on for on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| We recommended that no conditions be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| the rezoning's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| So I think the sentence was trying to get to that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| For some of us who may not yet understand what you have just told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| what would be the effect of having conditions or not having conditions in terms of rezoning the OS 1 district as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| currently promulgated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| allows three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| types of uses to be considered as uses permitted on review the cell towers marinas and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| multi-dwelling developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| we were asked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Placing a condition to remove that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| delete those three items as uses permitted on review and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| We recommended that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| the zoning be unconditioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| So that no no condition was would be placed on okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| Councilman Bailey, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Okay, something else, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| You you have the second motion to amend and it's been second and I see no discussion rate vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| All those in favor. Aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Opposed, no. Okay motion is doubly amended now. Mr. Becker. You still up I still up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Um, my next concern is the thing that we talked about at the last meeting that there still is no list of who of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| Parks are being rezoned no maps here and that really worries me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| What piece again what we said is it's exhibit one or a or whatever it is and all city parks and all city parks is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| Kind of an interesting open-ended question and it feels like we're sort of abdicating our responsibility to decide these things by saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| Some interesting questions about what is a city park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| interestingly, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Some people I've talked to have said that Mary Costas Park is going to be included in this that it's going to be zoned open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| space some people say it isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Maybe there's Joe Howie Park included in this it's not on the list, but that certainly is a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| and I think I have some particular fears of of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| I-275 business park being being zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| So I'd like to think about some ways we could actually get some clarifying language to get what we mean here if we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| And then I would like there are one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Fifth district parks that have some committed capital money for changes that I would like to exempt from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| So we can move forward with the capital projects, but that's a different one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| I I don't know if anybody has any thoughts about the definition of a city park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| Here because it is kind of wide open and we should clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| Well, we had that discussion last week go ahead Nick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Yeah, I looking at OS one section two point four point two is of our ordinance is is is OS one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1413)|
| 0:23:41| under B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| Three it says park and recreation uses including parks playgrounds golf courses cycling hiking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| equestrian trails parkways country clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| excluding primary and accessory structures hunting preserves camps blah blah blah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| And it does describe a park as kind of a recreation facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| I don't know. I guess I'll leave this open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| I don't know that we're intending to change that language other than to say all parks and recreation areas, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| Okay, mr. Becker. Well, I I don't think mr. Dove. Let me explain my question again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| We're saying in this ordinance. We are rezoning all city parks to OS one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| There's not a list of that and city parks is not I mean we don't say all city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| Parks run by the Parks and Recreation Department. We say all city parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| And some of the things on exhibit one are not run by the city. So I'm not sure what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| Legally, we are changing here. What are the and you had asked at the last meeting for a list that said from A to B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| And mr. Donaldson said we had that I assume that that was going to be appended as another exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| But and that we had Park a currently zoned this to become either OS one. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| I mean, it's what do we mean by all city parks and so mark do we have the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| I have a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| that we have used in compiling the Knoxville Knox County Parks Recreation and Greenways plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| it shows all of the acreage and all of the current zoning and whether it's completely within the city or outs partly outside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1507)|
| 0:25:15| city I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Wasn't privy to the exhibit that was handed out two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| So I don't know how it compares to the list that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| We also have a list that the city parks and rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| maintains so we would compare our list to their list and to the exhibit and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| We're doing okay. Thank you councilman Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| Thank You mayor, I share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Councilman Becker's vice mayor Becker's concerned about the ambiguity in this language and particularly have a question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| Our legal counsel, I thought that we had amended this language to delete log haven and somehow it has jumped back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| I cannot find the amended language that was included on our first consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Here, we just added three from the list River Bluff 10 mile and Turkey Creek, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| But it's still it's still listed on page three. That's in the whereas where we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| Whereas we started in August 12. All right, so that was NPC's recommendations and that's what NPC recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| We can't take that out. That's actually what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| But when we go to we go to the section 1 and it's not there then that's that's okay. Great. That's covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| I share vice mayor's Becker's concern about the ambiguity here. You mentioned Chilhowee Park. I'm thinking of the Knoxville Zoological Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1585)|
| 0:26:33| I and I guess I have a concern or vice mayor Becker has said that he would like to propose to exclude some parks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| His district because he realizes there are capital projects that are pending. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| Districts or other councilmen who may find out down the road that there are problems making improvements to their parks because of this language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| And I wondered Ron could you speak to the law departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| We received something from your department this week opining that perhaps there could be some future problems if this is passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| Could you speak to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Well, the issue is to future problems involve the open space issue and particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Plans that have been made for for existing parks and for future use of parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| That would be not be allowed because of that restriction on open space use. It's the percentage. I think that's involved there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| Mr. Donaldson might be in a better position to speak as to exactly what the percentage is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| But that that's the issue is the percentage of available use for open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| the current ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| has a maximum lot coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Factor of 5% for any man-made features or structures and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| in an active recreation park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| That would be very problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| I you know, I guess I guess that that's one concern our future improvements to parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| The other concern is the loss of grandfathering that the law department spoke to this week. Would you address that as well, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| regarding the grandfathering issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| You have certain specific uses now that are permitted or would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| In a private setting would be considered grandfathered. There's a serious question as to whether a government use would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| Grandfathering would even apply but in any situation where you're seeking to change zoning that would affect the grandfathering and essentially by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1699)|
| 0:28:27| Grandfathering goes away if the owner of the property request rezoning of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| So you lose the grandfathering effect anyway, and we have a real question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| Grandfathering would apply in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| but any change on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| might have the effect of doing away with any grandfather because the owner is requesting the rezoning the city owns the parkland and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| City is requesting the rezoning. I just really I still have a lot of concerns about the way this is written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| I think that the language is very muddy. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| The the future is muddy. I don't think the intent is muddy at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| I think I think we all intend to do something going forward to protect parks and I think the discussion that we had about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| Recommending to MPC that a new parks district be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| I think that's something that can be done very expeditiously and we can come back with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| Park parks district a park zone that would apply to parks that that are recreational and in nature and not open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| But I just can't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Cramming around peg in a square hole and taking all of our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| Especially as ambiguous as this list is and throwing them all into open space. I think there are serious legal concerns. Mr. Gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1765)|
| 0:29:34| Thank You mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| excuse me, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Guess one thing that I want to say is that in in looking at this and let me back up and just give a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| bit of history the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| The way that I got involved in this and Dave is still here. I think is that yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| I heard that there was the potential of supportive housing going in Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| Which I'm opposed to I'm opposed to supportive housing in any of our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| And when I got into this I found out that in looking at the parks across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| that basically what the problem is, we've got all kinds of zones for the parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| What we really if you think back last April when we first got into this and somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| I'm learning that we don't keep things very simple around here that what we were looking for is a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| Protect all our parks whether that be a revision to os1 or whether we come up with a new park zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| we were given information in terms of what Memphis had done and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| but what's happened is and where my frustration comes is that in what we've been receiving from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| MPC has not been clarity and how this could work. I don't think and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| So one of the things that we were pushing is to go ahead and get the parks that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| zoned os1 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| then go back we can and look at the os1 in terms of any kind of modifications that need to be done to that or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| if we can go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| Come up with a park zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Basically the list that that we have here is a list of parks that are zoned anything from office to residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| They're a whole mixture of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| And so what part of the plan was if we can get the parks at least into one zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| And then look at that zone and modify that or come up with another way that that would be a start in which to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| this done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| I appreciate what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| vice mayor Becker has to say and what councilman Roddy has to say I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| think that if we go ahead and pass this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Instruct MPC to go ahead and either modify the os1 or come up with the parks that for instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| We can give them a time limit. I mean, why can't this be done in 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| I think that in looking at what capital projects there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| I'm not sure that there are any that are going to start within 60 days. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| one of the one of the things that I would hope would come out of this is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| We end up with a protection of all our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| And I do agree that we need a definition of what parks are or what parks will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| But I think this is a start and I think this is something to really get the ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| Moving in the right in the right direction. I'd also like to find out if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| Mr. McAdams would like to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1944)|
| 0:32:32| Please state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| Thank You vice mayor, I'm Tom McAdams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| 4823 old Kingston Pike. I don't want to reiterate everything that we went over two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| I would say that basically nothing has changed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Os one zoning is the city's official zone for parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| It is the only zone in which parks are a permitted use as opposed to a use permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| It's been used for 30 years for parks large and small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| It's been used for 30 years for parks that were intensely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Developed with ball fields and parking lots and playgrounds and for parks that are wilderness. It is the city's own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| Suddenly we have an interpretation that OS one is not appropriate for zones and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| I disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| I do not think that is a collect a correct legal reading and neither does any law director of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2000)|
| 0:33:28| Unless unless what we see on Friday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| Counts as a differing opinion. What we do see is a last-minute attempt to derail it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| Similar there there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Some members of the administration who've been opposed from the beginning who voted against it in April who voted against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| Two weeks ago, and who will probably vote against it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| There have been procedural moves and efforts to postpone this to amend it to change it to send it back to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| And all we're saying all I'm saying is please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Approve this on second reading provide the protection for the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| It is it can be on an interim basis, but we don't know when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| Any recommendation is going to come back from MPC you asked them six months ago to come back with a zoning to protect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2052)|
| 0:34:20| These parks and that didn't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| So two weeks ago you said another resolution you passed another resolution sending it back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| Asking them to do what you just talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Look at either amending OS 1 or coming up with a new park zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| And if they do that then in 60 days you can rezone all these parks to the new park zone and that solves any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| Problems the best reason that anybody has come up with for not passing. This is that they have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2081)|
| 0:34:49| That it might not be grandfathered the city code says it's grandfathered if you read the non-conforming uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| Section of the city code it says your parks are grandfathered in any type of use if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| Some say it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Stop certain improvements to parks. No one has cited one despite the fact this has been pending for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| No one has cited a single part that would violate the OS 1 zoning that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| Violate the restriction not a single park improvement that's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| That would be blocked by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| so I would urge you adopt this then the protection is in place and the protection is the process the public process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| Multiple hearings posting the property and so on and then you can come back and amend this as necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| But the protection is in place and the public is guaranteed of involvement. That's what this is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| I would urge you to pass it without further amendment without deleting any parks. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| Let me let me go to councilman Becker. Are you finished? Mr. Grieve? Yes. Um, I guess I have a couple things. I mean one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2149)|
| 0:35:59| One of the challenges I've got is mr. McAdams, you're exactly right. Nothing has changed in two weeks two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| We sat here and argued for a long time about what the list of facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| We were zoning were and we still don't have that list and it's very frustrating. We are passing a law here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2168)|

| 0:36:16| The the comment that's been made a lot about the health care bill is well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| They passed it without reading keep in mind. We are passing something that there's not anything even to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| We are passing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| What we're saying is we're asking another agency to do our job for us and I don't like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| Because I'm not sure what they will do. Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| There are a couple places in my district that do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Capital projects that are in the budget that this would affect and I'd like to to offer an amendment to to delete those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2199)|
| 0:36:46| And I think what I'd like to do is is and mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| My my thing would be to do a someplace that would say except and my gut is to say right after in section 1 it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| all city parks comma except for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2217)|

| 0:37:05| Larry Cox Senior Center Fountain City Skate Park and the I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| 275 business park and the last two were actually not facing capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| Fountain City Skate Park is currently zoned is a flood zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| We worked really hard to get permission from the feds to build that and they agreed for us to build it in a flood zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| So I'd like to keep that there and frankly the business park just scares me if we read if we rezone that office space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| We're putting a lot of businesses and a lot of jobs in danger, and I don't want to go there. So that's an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2248)|
| 0:37:36| His second is there a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| All right, I'll rule that dies for lack of a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| Mr. Brown is next and then mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Della Vope I just had for a point of information on this list list of parks exhibit a the Eastport Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| Life for council to know right now. That's construction work going on at Eastport Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| And it's it's a building of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| KCDC is building for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Senior citizens don't have a problem with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| It's going to be an asset to the community, but I just thought you might like to know that particular park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| I assume will be no more once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| That housing is completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| Mr. Della Vope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Yes, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| Guess I still have an open question and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| whether we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Pass this tonight and then let MPC correct it as both Dwayne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| Suggested and mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| McAdams suggested or whether we leave this pending and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| MPC if they have a recommendation for parks to bring it to us in two weeks or four weeks or whatever it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| I mean there is that possibility of just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Suspending this and asking that the other is to simply plunge forward and do it and then let them correct it. That seems a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| Little bit awkward, but but I understand the intent is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| The intent is good. That is that we protect parks and we don't want to lose that and I think Dwayne's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| Request that we keep it simple stupid is there's some value to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| We can we can get we can get tied up in knots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| My understanding from prior comments of council was that the city does not have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| Technically observe its own zoning requirements if it doesn't want to these are zonings of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| private properties in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| Tying our hands for going forward on a on a construction project that you said, I mean that you suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| I realized that the intent here is to have parks go through a procedural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| Two or three step dance where they go to MPC and council before changes are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| But the things you're talking about are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Changes that are approved and are in are in are in the mill and it so that purpose is served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| So I guess we should do some kind of polling to decide whether or ask mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| McDonald's and to whether he can come up with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| active parks recommendation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Satisfies these concerns in a short order and we could postpone this for two weeks or four weeks or whether we need to pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| And then get it a clarification from MPC. Is that a question for mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| Donaldson, I think it probably ought to be at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| we plan to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Proposed zone district on our December 9th MPC meeting agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| Which is the next available agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| December the 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| I guess the question is is there something so pressing that we can't wait till that meeting or the meeting that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| Shortly after December 9th, and I I don't know whether postponing it for that length of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| Creates any harm or not, but but there's some value to to waiting now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| I don't I don't mean to make this more complicated than it already is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| But but there's that option of doing it once and getting it over with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| Was that a motion or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| No, I'll leave that just as a discussion for the table here. Let me go to mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| Bailey and then to miss Roddy and into myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| Thank You nice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| Mr. Swanson, I wanted to I guess pick up where councilman Delvaux P left we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2477)|
| 0:41:26| Provide or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Proceed with some type of protection in lieu of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| Not a good definition of parks and really not a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| defining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| the parks that we intend to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| And I mr. Walsh is here tonight, and I'm sure you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| I don't know how involved he's been in this thus far, but we have been pretty sloppy about this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| Which parks and which you know what not parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| What's what's the best way to proceed should we go ahead and pass this as it is and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| Come up with a list and a definition and amend it at a different at a later council meeting. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2520)|
| 0:42:08| Would suggest to you that there are a couple of options available to you with regard to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Option would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| To address your concerns about which parks you are specifically addressing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| The best thing might be to postpone for two or four weeks ever how long it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| For mr. Donaldson and perhaps mr. Walsh to get together to prepare a comprehensive list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| Every park that would be covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| By what is proposed by this ordinance that way you would have a definitive list of each parcel of property that you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| Rezoning here rather than the somewhat amorphous language of all parks including but not limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| So that would be one way to address that another method that you could pursue to address this whole situation is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2577)|
| 0:43:05| Perhaps mr. Devil de la Volpe was shooting at was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| move to postpone until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| your mid-december meeting so that you would have the benefit of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| recommendation from MPC with regard to whether or not you wanted to to create a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| Separate zoning category specifically designed for the protection of parks and then put all of these parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| In that particular zoning classification, that's that's more a long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| The sort of matter you're addressing the more short-term just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| Specifically addressing the problem you raised is to postpone for two weeks and ask them to put together that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| Comprehensive list of property that would be covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| Does that answer your question? I think it does. I'll listen to my colleagues and then get back to it. Miss Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| Thank You vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| First of all, I'd like to speak to the amendment that she made that died for lack of a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| You know as an at-large council member, I would love to have been able to support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| However, I I cannot because we don't have comprehensive information about what other parks in other districts across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| Might be affected by capital improvement plans that could effectively be be stopped by by this action of Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| The other thing I would like to speak to is. Mr. Donaldson indicated that that under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| Ambiguous language that we have here included but not limited to that. He would go to the adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| Knoxville Knox County parks and greenways plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| And we had a resolution that I asked to be withdrawn last week that I expected to bring back this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| There was some miscommunication and it's not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| but the deals with with specifically with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| Amendment of that plan to delete reference to private lands, which are not public parks specifically Fort Higley and Fort Stanley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| And so if we pass this tonight with the included but not limited to and are talking about relying upon that document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| there are inaccuracies in that document and then we are back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| rezoning private lands because of this sweeping action and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| There was an insinuation made earlier that members of council don't support parks. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| Totally agree with councilmember grief. We we have a problem here that we are trying to address within the constraints of our procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| The original resolution that this council passed that we sent to MPC is in our packet and I don't read anywhere in that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| Where we ask MPC to come up with a new zoning category or ask them to amend OS 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| They did as far as I can read here what we asked them to do. It just came back with the unexpected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| result that the OS 1 district was perhaps not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| Flexible as as we might have thought to do this. Yes, I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| We have parks that have been zoned OS 1 that probably don't belong there. That's part of the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| We're trying to fix we have parks with ball fields and we have Rocky Hill ball fields that that's that's zoned OS 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| We have Tyson Park, which is full of playgrounds and tennis courts that zoned OS 1. So obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| Perhaps the interpretation has changed over the years as administration has changed. But what we have here is a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| It's it's a muddy mess and we're trying to fix it as best we can and I think every member of this council supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| A layer of protection for parks, but I think we have to go about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| With our eyes open and with clear and definitive information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| Let me go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Myself on this. Um, I want to sort of echo a little bit of what miss Roddy said about a concern on this and and frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| I'm fairly angry about not getting a second on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| What I've heard a lot of people here say is well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Why don't we pass this and hopefully we can fix the problem it creates pretty soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| And I want to I want to talk a little about what some of those problems are and keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| Three and a half years ago. We started talking about fixing some problems in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| Some of that zone that transition zone between neighborhood and office and we still haven't fixed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| So some of those probably keep in mind what it says is no more than 5% of the land can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| In a non-natural state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| In effect, what we're saying is that we're going to stop cutting the grass on the golf course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| We're going to stop building expansions on the rec centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| We're going to stop building greenways and I don't feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| Saying well, let's go ahead and say that and hope we can fix it down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| Mr. McAdams talked about well, nobody's got any any concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| Lists of capital projects. They're not that hard to come by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| You know, I just asked I not only asked parks and recs not all city parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| What's out there and they're there and you know, they're they're parks all over there to getting things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| It doesn't feel right to say let's make a mistake and let's assume we can fix it later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| And while we're at it, we're not even clear what the mistake is because there isn't even a list of what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| so I I will be voting against this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| I would urge my colleagues to do that because there's a lot of capital money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| That could be lost in our parks if we do this really badly so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| Other comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| Let's try a voice vote. Oh, is there I mean, I don't think that I'm I think this has probably been one more sloppy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2904)|
| 0:48:34| Transactions between all of us the administration the MPC me, you know this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| And and and I hate that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| People are interested in this and have passion for this issue and they want to see it resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| And I think there is the intention of this council as I read it to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| But but right now we just don't have it where we need it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| so I don't think anything's going to happen between now and two weeks or a month from now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| So I'm going to go along with a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| although I hate to do that because this is our job to do the people's business and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| Expedited and so they don't have to keep coming up here and and and staying in touch with what we're we may be doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| May not be doing so I'm going to go along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| Denial, I think so or if someone wants to make the motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| I'm gonna wait and see but I'm definitely I guess what I want to do is postpone. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| Saw miss Roddy and then mr. Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| I'd like to confirm again with mr. Donaldson. Mr. Donaldson under this language of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| Specifically included but not limited to where you will your referencing document be the Knox County City of Knoxville Parks and Greenways plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2985)|
| 0:49:57| We have a list that was used in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| Drafting that plan, but you have specifically amended your ordinance to remove log haven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| So that's that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Piece of property is not an issue. Our list does not include Fort Stanley or Fort Higley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| And none of the other lists do as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| So I guess I heard you earlier to say that under the ambiguous language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| Specifically but not limited to that one of the referencing documents that you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| Go to that you might reference would be that Parks and Greenways plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| Had we the the companion resolution tonight to make the corrections to that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| I might be a little bit more comfortable with that with the same ambiguity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| But since we don't tonight I am going to support a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| I don't want to cut off debate because as we know postponement is a priority motion and I don't want to cut off debate when mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| Grieve has something else to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| But I would suggest that perhaps a postponement for two weeks so that we can get that resolution back that was withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| Two weeks ago that was intended to be here tonight to clarify the corrections in the parks and greenways plan if that's going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| Referencing document for this that at least needs to be correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| mr. Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| Now with the postponement now, what is what's to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| Well one thing we need we need to get a clear definition. Are you asking me? Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| We need a clear definition of what parks are what we're trying to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| the next thing we need to do is we need to get a list of the total list of parks that that are included with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| this definition and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| then the other thing is we we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| Did you hear did I hear you correctly saying that Fort Higley and and what are included on your lists I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| Mean the ones you just mentioned Fort Stanley and Fort Higley which are mentioned in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3109)|
| 0:51:56| Parks recreation and greenways plan as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| future preservation sites is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Not on the our list of city parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| Well those two things for starters and I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| There are other things we probably ought to get that together and then decide how we're going to go about obtaining them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| Yeah, I mean just as an addition. I actually had some discussion with mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| Donaldson about what the maps on these look like traditionally with zoning says a map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| You know what property it is and we don't have that for any of these and there are a couple parks that it's not even clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| What the park is but?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| You have the floor mr. Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| May I make a comment? I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| You actually if somebody recognizes you you can and until that time would you would you go ahead and sit down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3162)|
| 0:52:51| Mr. Peabody don't stand to the microphone, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Mr. Grieve or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Ultimate Roddy's gonna mr. Green's permission. He still has the floor, but I was going to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| To in addition to mr. Bailey's comment about what we might hope to accomplish with the post on page nine of the parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3184)|
| 0:53:12| Greenways plan there is a paragraph about lands that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| Acquired is the word and Fort Stiglian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| Higley and Stanley are listed are on that page as being acquired as public lands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3200)|
| 0:53:27| And that is simply an error and so I would hope in two weeks. We would bring back the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| putting into motion the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| Correction of that plan so that if that's a referencing document used that that is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| I really have discomfort with a general rezoning of private land without adequate notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| With with this kind of language in here, so mr. Green has the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| One of my questions I've got a couple of questions then apparently so mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| You've not seen this list of parks that go with this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| I did not see the list that was handed out at the meeting two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| Did you see the one that came with the packet is this what I'm asking is is this list of parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| Similar to your or is it like your list of parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| Our exhibit a I have exhibit a which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| From as near as I can tell corresponds with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| the list that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| So it is although our well that market square I haven't gone through line by line, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| Generally, I think it it it matches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Pretty well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| The other thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| What what I what I'm personally looking for and and I think that I think my colleagues are also is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3290)|
| 0:54:57| again the protection of the parks within the city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| What's interesting to me is that even some of the parks that are now zoned os1 don't fall under the guidelines of os1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3302)|
| 0:55:12| As I said earlier the way this whole thing started was to begin to you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| It started with Lakeshore and then in looking at our parks and realizing the different zonings of all the different parks and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| Looking at the parks that are zoned os1 that are five acres some of them less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| Some of them are all ball fields and this sort of thing that basically excuse me. Basically what we have is kind of a mess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| If the whole the whole area under parks to use councilman Bailey's term is sloppy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| We don't really have I guess in our city a proper zoning for all our parks now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| Whether they we have active parks and passive parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| We did have a resolution some time ago asking about the possibility of NPC looking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| coming up with a proper zoning whether it's a pp1 or pp2 or os1 or os2 to try to clarify all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| parks that we have and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| What I'm interested in is finding a way in which not only the greenways, but all our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| Fall under the proper zoning now. Can we do that in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| We've had assurances from the administration that nothing's going to happen in any of the parks as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| Housing or this sort of thing, but how long will it really take us to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| Make sure that the parks that we have the ones that are already zoned os1 that are not correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| But all these other parks fall under a proper category. That's what I'm interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| I'm interested in a time frame so that we're not three years from now talking about parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| So I guess my question is to mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Donaldson how long would it take could we have this done in 30 days 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| I just said that we would we have it scheduled for our December 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| You already have a zoning. I mean you you have a recommendation for like passive parks active parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| Oh, that's what we're working on it, and we will have it by the December 9th meeting. Okay. I misunderstood. I didn't realize that okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| So that'll be coming to you folks on December 9th. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| That's the next available MPC meeting. Okay, then it would come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3435)|
| 0:57:23| Middle of January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| middle of January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| Would it be the end of December mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Donaldson if it comes to your meeting our normal rhythm is to take it to the first meeting of the following month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3449)|
| 0:57:36| Okay, so it'd be the first meeting in January. Yes. All right, we can double advertise and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| Anticipate that it will fly through MPC without any changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| Yeah, but that would be the creation of a parks ordinance that then arguably would be adopted by this group and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| We would have to to send the parks issue back to MPC for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| consistent with the new parks category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| Within your zoning ordinance, we could that's how that would happen. We could do those in parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| Well, we have a 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| public notice requirement for amending the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| that we try to stick to and we've been known to violate it and move it up a little bit, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| It'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| It'd be doable. I mean in our one en to we adopted the zone and the next motion on the agenda was rezoning property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| So we could conceivably do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| With proper notice. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| I'm sorry, mr. Delevaux pay and then mr. Bailey then myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| Mr. Delevaux. Hey, yeah, I was going to follow up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| With mr. Donaldson because I remember attending one or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| public meetings where there were maps of parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| I don't know whether we were doing sector plans or part of the amendment the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| The maps were already created and there was a an attempt to classify a lot of them as PP public parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3545)|
| 0:59:13| At that time without a separate zone being assigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| But we went through that whole kind of plan side to look at parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| You say you've been working with a list that includes I guess both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| Joe's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Joe Walsh's list of of parks and the parks and recreation plan that we've recently adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| It is there difficulty in just simply assembling the description of parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| From that sector plan or something else so that that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Sort of the raw material to go in whatever you come up with for active parks or passive parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| No, it isn't the exercise that you're referring to was with the annual one-year plan update that we completed this spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| Our major initiative was to update the land use classification for all the city parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| It's about 99 parcels weren't there that you that you look something like that. It was a large number number about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| so we have that geography the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| The delay in the initial request when City Council asked us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| Applying the open space zone district to all city parks was the analysis of every park as far as the lot coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3616)|
| 1:00:23| That took a lot of time. It took us three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| But we did it and we made a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Based on the requirements that are described in the OS one district and that OS one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| Language and concern you had is is the sub part D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| That has the area regulations that deal with coverage of size setbacks on front and side lots and those types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| That's right. So now as we create a new district for active recreation areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| We get to determine what those numbers are rather than living with what OS one is so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| We can write an ordinance that will work for us for active recreational park lands, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| And as a practical matter since active parks are city parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| The design of the park is done in the administration with help probably from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| but but setbacks and those type of things aren't an issue when you're talking about a park structure or whatever in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| Zoning for an active park. Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| Well, one of the differences between a parks district in an open space district will be that the dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| Requirements for setbacks in a parks district will be much smaller than what are shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| In the open space and the lot coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| Will be much greater than what is shown for the open space district and the list of permitted uses which will be much smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3697)|
| 1:01:45| Than what is shown for the open space? All right. Well, I'm going to suggest at this point that that mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| Grieve that we that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| Aren't you know, we undertake something maybe that we didn't come here plan to do but that we postponed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| Both with the understanding the administration is not going to do anything contrary to it in the interim and that we get a rational a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| Rational system to stick the parks under with with the maps that go with it and all that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| It's in the sector plan and we tackle that the first week in January if that's the first meeting we can do that and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| Mr. Donaldson to do whatever notices he has to to tell the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| That's what we're sitting out to do and let's let's get it done once and get it done, right? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| Guess I'll call that a motion if if you don't object| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| But I'll hear from you first if you if you have an objection to you got the pending motion, right? Can you well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| It's actually mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| Can you restate what you what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Yeah, the motion would be a motion to postpone decision on this item 9a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3759)|
| 1:02:47| I guess that's for two months. I don't know what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| It's it's it's roughly that time frame so that we can then address the MPC recommendations for the for the proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3769)|
| 1:02:58| classification of parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Including a listing of specific properties with maps or other information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| They think germane to adding certainty to the property designation. Let me do a a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| Mr. Smoley, I recognize mr. Swanson first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Let me just suggest that the appropriate motion is a motion to postpone until January 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| and the rest of your motion is simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| Instructive to those who need to do something in the in the interim to get that done and then certainly it's appropriate to issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| You know your your suggestion as to to what is to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| But the only operative part of your motion will be a motion to postpone to January 11, which is the first meeting in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| Well, we'll adopt that recommendation. Let me hold your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| Motion for one second because that would cut off debate and I see mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| Bailey had his light on and I'd like to leave to comment about what motion we're making. Let me go to mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| Bailey first vice mayor that that's what I was going to ask to had we come up with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| Council date where this would be complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| That's what I was going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| But the other thing is we generally acknowledge someone that comes to the podium podium and I'd like to acknowledge. Mr. Peabody. Oh, mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| Peabody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| Thank You councilman Bailey, I just want to point out a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| First this is first came to light at City Council April the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3860)|
| 1:04:27| I'm a layman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| quite frankly just getting involved in for better or for worse in the city of Knoxville politics and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| My understanding of what passed here on April the 20th was clear instruction to MPC to come back and fix the parks issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3875)|
| 1:04:44| What what what MPC delivered back to City Council a few weeks ago did not do in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| What was instructed of MPC to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| having said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Councilman Brown pointed out a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| There are parks today that the city is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| losing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| East port I understand was a planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| Situation that was an old city park that is now being taken over for the East East port elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| Renovation project. I understand that there's a park today in Forth and Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| Part of it has already been sold another part of it has either been sold or is about to be sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| So to say that there is or to presume there is no urgency in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| Trying trying to have a blanket protection on parks while these details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Quite honestly from a layman from an average person standing here watching this unfold what I see here is pure politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3937)|
| 1:05:45| There are multiple agendas before me and none in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3945)|
| 1:05:55| I'm not clear if the agendas tie in with the initial idea to protect all the city parks from any kind of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3955)|
| 1:06:03| That are contrary to their usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| Many of the city parks in this city have been donated to the city for usage as exclusively parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| Many of the parks have been purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| There's lots of different ways that they came into possession and to sit here quite frankly and delay this out for another two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3974)|
| 1:06:22| I quite I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| Astounded at I believe City Council could should step up should vote for this allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| Mr. Grieve to allow the other resolution that passed here two weeks ago to to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| And be worked on next month and and correct this and protect the parks do what do with this do what you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=3998)|
| 1:06:46| Said you were going to do on April the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| Gonna recommend recognize myself and mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Delvapi this is a parliamentary question about the best way to accomplish what you want and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| A postponement till the first week in January works, and I guess my question for mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| Donaldson and mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4026)|
| 1:07:06| Swanson is on January 20th what I would actually like January 2nd 11th 11th 11th. Thank you January 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4026)|
| 1:07:14| I'd like to see something like what we did with our 1en which is here is a new park zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Here are the parks that are being rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| And I'm wondering if a better way to accomplish that would be a motion to refer this ordinance back to MPC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4040)|
| 1:07:28| Ask them to put the new zone on the parks that are in this because what I don't want to get caught in is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| Level that we get delayed then and maybe maybe I'm splitting hairs, and it really doesn't make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| But I rather agree with the idea of let's get something done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| And frankly I'd like to see sort of all the parks zoned the right thing there ought to be it it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| Frightens me when I look at what some of the parks are zoned right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| Both ones that are zoned OS one that do not fit under that and ones that are zoned other zones that are that are incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| So do mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| Donaldson response and do you have a either you have a sense of which is the best way to accomplish getting this on our plate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4078)|
| 1:08:06| effectively on January 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4088)|
| 1:08:16| Was looking at a note um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| The most effective motion for getting this effectively on our plate January 11th a motion to postpone to that date or a motion to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4098)|
| 1:08:25| this back to MPC with instructions to do this right and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| Think we want to get there, and I just don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| Think ultimately you're going to get there either way and in my view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| The appropriate way to deal with it is to refer this back to MPC for consideration consistent with their action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| Related to the resolution that was adopted two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| That to me is the most logical method to deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| which is not to say that you can't postpone it until the first meeting in January and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| Deal with it then and I think I think MPC understands what's wanted here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| And could come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| On as expedited a basis as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| bringing you both a proposed new zoning classification and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4149)|
| 1:09:16| The the proposal to put the parks in that classification is that if is that a fair statement mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| Donaldson or not I'm speaking for you and shouldn't be I believe I understand the instructions and we can get there either way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| We've already received our marching orders with the resolution at the last meeting you're marching towards December 9th, correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4168)|
| 1:09:37| Mr. Green do you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| I want to make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| Two questions that are a question I have and then then I want to read something also is that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| If today we want to designate a park as a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| Where in the ordinance does that piece of property go? What does it fall under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| We have if we have a piece of property today, and we want to make it a park. What does it fall under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| The act in my opinion the act of designating a parcel of park is independent of the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4208)|
| 1:10:16| Well if we wanted to zone it it it's my understanding that the only zoning classification that we have is OS one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| Now other zone districts allow parks as a use permit and on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| Okay, but if we require a site plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| But if we want a zone if we want to call a zone out for a park, what zone do we have for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| We don't and most communities don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| If I can most of our zones actually do list parks playgrounds etc as a use permit and on review so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4245)|
| 1:10:53| They fit under a lot of category a lot of zoning categories, but there's not a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| Zone that's set up only for parks and playgrounds and I asked mr. McAdams a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| As he comes forward I would like to say if you folks refer back to your April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| Resolutions we had a resolution in April and I want to read this to you as mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| McAdams forward the council of the city of Knoxville hereby respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| Requests that the professional planning staff of the Metropolitan Planning Commission review and study the current zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| Utilizing their professional skill and expertise in determining the best and most effective method to afford zoning protection to all city parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| Giving appropriate consideration to amending the current OS one designation as well as to creating a new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| designation specifically designed for providing the needed protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| That was the resolution in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| This is the one that was back in in April, this is not in your packet and well, what's the one that's in our packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| Is it called 11f? Yes, I didn't I didn't find can what what section is that going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4319)|
| 1:12:07| This was one that was that I had two resolutions back in in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| Is this 11f| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| This is 11 11 K back then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| This is an old document from the from the minutes back then where we had requested that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4339)|
| 1:12:27| If I I'm sorry, mr. McAdams. Sorry. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| Think the the issue in referring back to the April resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| There is a list of the parks. There has been a list of the parks from day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| There are only specific parts on that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| To initiate the rezoning process you have to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Council has to identify the property that it's initiated. And when you look at that when it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| requested NPC reconsider all land located within all city parks listed on exhibit a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| So all that you initiated the rezoning of in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| What's the parks listed on exhibit a and that's exhibit a and the ordinance that's before you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4386)|
| 1:13:13| has the same exhibit a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Attached to it the same list of parks attached to it that was attached to your resolution in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| Now what's making it confusing is the language in the ordinance in the proposed ordinance or the pending ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4403)|
| 1:13:31| that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| Included but not limited to and the way of doing away with any confusion about it is to delete that language if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| You amend the ordinance to delete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| Specifically included but not limited to so the ordinance reads to change the classy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| Classification OS one of all parks set forth on the attached list. That's consistent with what you did in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| it's the same list and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| It's the list that is attached to the draft of the ordinance that has been published that was on your website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| That's in your package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| There there is a list of the parts. They're there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| It's a specific list the confusion are those included but not limited to words in the ordinance if you take those out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| There's no confusion about which parts you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| If I may before you leave, mr. McAdams, we're still left with the question of are we doing this correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| Or are we doing it as a stopgap until we do it correctly and we've heard the debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| Endlessly about active and passive parks and and parks that have different features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| So so I guess we're we're struggling with why not give MPC a second bite at what we admittedly asked them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| back in April and and they struggled when they got the relay with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| their conception of what OSN was really designed to do and it may be that we need an OS 2 or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| PP or a park one or something else that does that so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Come back to after listening to the debate again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| Is there any really threatened harm that's going to happen between now and getting a second look from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| Hopefully the look we prayed for before but maybe didn't communicate to their satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| And I think that's where we are this this idea of the area regulations and coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| We've ignored it and you've made the argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| We've ignored it repeatedly in the past over the last 30 years and I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| 10 wrongs don't make a right shouldn't we just do it right this time is is the debate we're having up here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| Is there any threat that that that's going to happen between now and January 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| If not, there's no harm in waiting a few extra weeks to see what they come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| We may reject that but at least we will have sent it back to them with a clear mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| We want to cover all the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I'm still unclear from the list whether little vest pocket one acre parks in various neighborhoods are covered or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4555)|
| 1:16:02| But I mean, we're going to send them back to look at the parks come up with a list and do that kind of thing. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| Unless you unless you tell us something that the long-standing violation of our own ordinance now changes the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4568)|
| 1:16:15| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| maybe that's a construction a rule of construction a court might apply or might reject because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| In contradiction to the plain wording, so if we don't have an imminent threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| Do you see any harm in waiting until we get a second recommendation from MPC? Hopefully more inclusive. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| All right. What's the harm? All right. Well to your first point, I don't think you've been violating your ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| The only thing that has changed is MPC's interpretation and it just now changed for 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| It has been interpreted and MPC has fully recommended that you place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| Parks in this zone and the question is what does that subsection six maximum lot coverage say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4610)|
| 1:16:57| It says all man-made structures or features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| Excluding earthwork, which has been seeded or otherwise returned to its natural condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| Shall cover not more than 5% the way that has consistently been interpreted as for 30 years is as not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| Not being violated by soccer fields, which are seeded by baseball fields, which are seeded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| by golf courses, which are seeded or spring or something and all those types of things that consist that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4641)|
| 1:17:30| Interpretation of that has been city parks are permitted. It's not a violation as far as I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| This time is the first time it's ever been interpreted as a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| I don't think it does violate it. My reading of that is that it's not a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| So that's one issue. I would equate the question of timing to this number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| Who knows when it will come back up? It took six months the first time will it be back here in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| Who knows number two the assurances of the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| I think we're all hopeful that we're going to have a change of administration in very short order because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| We're all hopeful that our mayor is going to be elected governor or maybe has been by now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| So the assurances from that administration or insurances from that administration, I guess we'll know Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| How long it's going to be in place when he makes his announcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| But the situation I would compare it to is when you annex property when you annex property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| You don't sit around and say let's wait six months before we rezone this and see what it ought to what ought to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| You promptly and immediately rezone the property as soon as it comes into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| So what you have here is property that's in the wrong zone. It's not in a protected zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| It's not in a zone that ensures public input if you change the use if the use is changed next month or the month after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| Then you know there was no protection and it's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| So if you want to do it really do it in my opinion the right way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| Cut out cut out all this stuff and do it the right way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| Here's what you do number one amend this to take out that language about including but not limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| Then you're rezoning the same list of parks that you started with in April number two advise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4748)|
| 1:19:15| MPC informally that what you want them to do is to initiate on their own which they have the right to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4755)|
| 1:19:22| The rezoning of all city parks to the part to track the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| recommendation that they're sending to you and that way they travel in tandem if they initiate the rezoning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| They at the same time amended that that will arrive to you whenever in January or February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| Or March or whenever but when it gets here that in the interim you will have been protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| and will you have violated it not in my opinion not in the opinion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| City attorneys and and everyone else who's interpreted this for 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| So I think you're complying with the law. I think you're clearing up any confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| You're protecting the parks in the interim and you have not the solution, but the better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| Zoning coming a zoning that is more suitable. All right. Thank you. We need to move on with business. We appreciate your views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| Um, I've got mr. Bailey myself and mr. Grieve now, so mr. Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| You're good, um, all right now, what did I want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| That was important out there, um, I guess I I will comment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| What what I heard about what the threat is is maybe there is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| Maybe there isn't I didn't I didn't hear a threat, but I don't know if I've heard a threat from the get-go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| I guess the other thing that felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| Interesting to me is that my understanding is we pretty much ignored the zoning code for the last 30 years as regards our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| And that's partly why we're in the mess. We're in so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| Think I the idea of getting this done right in January makes a lot of sense to me. Mr. Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| You go to you. Yeah, one of the questions I'd have and this goes to mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| Donaldson is are are we going to receive in January anything different than what we've already received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| From what we asked for in terms of in terms of the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| That's the first question, okay, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| Read from the resolution that was forwarded to me as a result of your April meeting and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| section 1 on page 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| As the Council of the city of Knoxville hereby respectfully request the MPC to consider rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4885)|
| 1:21:32| all land located within all city parks listed on exhibit a and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| all park expansion areas rezoned to OS 1 open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| With conditions which prohibit and restrict the development construction or operation of houses multi-dwelling structures or developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4904)|
| 1:21:52| commercial marinas or communication towers on such properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| That was the limit of our instructions and that is what we made a recommendation on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| Subsequent to that two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| You asked us to look at creating a new district for active recreation lands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| and we have scheduled that to appear on the December 9th MPC meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| we'll try to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| recommendation to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| which includes all of the parts listed on exhibit a and several that aren't listed on exhibit a and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4939)|
| 1:22:26| Probably ignore some parts that are on exhibit a because they are gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| But we'll do what has been requested of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| If I can do a quick follow-up question for mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4961)|
| 1:22:41| Do you understand that your rule is also to look at parks that are currently zoned OS 1 and shouldn't be and look at rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| Those if they're on this list. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4967)|

| 1:22:53| Mr. Grave, I'm sorry. I would like to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| amend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Ordinance that's in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| By removing oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| There actually was mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| Delevaux pay had made a motion to postpone and we kind of held off on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| There has not been a second yet, but I've not called it for lack of a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| So do you mr. Delvaux pay do you want to continue that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| I mean right now it sort of was hanging there and and it got lost but it is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| Out there without a second. So let me let me ask whether you want that motion to continue and answer a second on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5006)|
| 1:23:33| I do but if I might be permitted could mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| Grieve answer whether you have any objection to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| What I would like to do is to amend the ordinance and carry on with this do you want to press forward? Yes, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| Think I think I would see if we get a second and right is let's take our temperature on this and then we'll go from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| There right. Is there a second on mr. Delvaux pays motion to postpone until the January 11th meeting? I'm going to second that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5032)|
| 1:24:01| Now discussion on the motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| Mr. Grieve you have your light on would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| Miss Roddy and then mr. Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| I always like to keep debate open as long as possible as painful as it is sometimes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| Postponement being a priority motion does cut us off from hearing what it is that that mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| Grieve might want to do to amend the motion and perhaps his amendment would be helpful in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| Whatever might possibly be postponed if the postponement does pass counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| So I will not be although I do support a postponement eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| I will not be supporting this postponement in favor of hearing from mr. Grieve if that makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| Mr. Bailey and then I'll go to myself and I'm going to do the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| Because I want to hear what councilman Greaves has to do and I don't like to stop the debate either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| But one thing when we talk about these lists and what's in and what's not we still have to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| Clarification definition of what a park is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| What we're talking about. So, how do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| In order for mr. Donaldson to carry forward something that we're comfortable with I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5105)|
| 1:25:12| My sense on this is that somebody on council needs to step up and try and gather this kind of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5112)|
| 1:25:20| You know, and I don't know whether we want to ask mr. Swanson to take the lead on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| Well, I mean, you know when we talk about parks, I mean, I'm surely our law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| Director Laird Law Department has that definition somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| There's a definition in section on parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| But not in the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| Well, we can we can answer mr. Walsh there's a motion to postpone and and I think mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| Bailey's question is how we do follow up on this and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Frankly I'm going to say follow-up doesn't happen because we sit behind our microphones and say things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| Follow-up happens when we go gather information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| You know, we don't have a staff of of dozens of people who go work for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| So we've got to put some time in finding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| so my sense is at some level somebody on City Council has got to go talk to some of these people and bring the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| Information together because it it could be in mr. Walsh's in mr. Mills in mr. Swanson and in mr. Donaldson's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5175)|
| 1:26:22| Information and we can hear from all of them or we can ask somebody to gather that so well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| Who said they weren't comfortable with the definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| The one that's in here, yeah, that was me because there isn't any definition in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| And the list doesn't do any and I mean the list is the list is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| but then there is just this open-ended all other parks, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| There'll be my sense for follow-up. And I think the follow-up is important and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| I don't want to lose that. Um, I want to actually before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| Before we vote on the postponement, I want to come back to that but I actually want to follow up. Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| Grieve, you're not allowed to actually make a motion at the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| But several council members have said they would like to hear what your motion would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| And mr. Swanson, I believe I'm in an order and asking him to say what he would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| Asking to do if we don't postpone because that is actually germane to the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| To the extent that it's germane to the postponement that that's kind of an expansive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| Definition of what's your main to the postponement, but I think it would make you guys move faster. So I'd be all for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| Mr. Grieve tell us what you would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| What I would like to do is I'd like to make a motion that if you'll look at section 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5251)|

| 1:28:31| Mr. Grieve you have your light on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| You're done, um, I want to just say before we vote on the motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| I think mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5319)|

| 1:28:48| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| I don't know whether we want to just ask mr. Donaldson to take care of all that or whether somebody on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| Wants to suggest somebody else who were shepherd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5336)|

| 1:29:04| At the risk of wearing us all out. I'd ask mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Walsh to come to the microphone and tell us if he can shed light on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| The job that he's supposed to be doing for us and I know it's doing pretty well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| Can you help us define what the parks are and where they are so we can get on with this? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| would be glad to provide a list of all the parks that we currently maintain and treat as city parks, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5361)|

| 1:33:27| Mr. Delvaux pay. Yes. Well, I have mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| Walker here and I don't know whether you have bond council or someone with you that can be your backup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| I was troubled in all three of these ordinances the next three ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| This one is electric then we go to gas and then we go to water system revenue bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| And there's a series of three bonds totaling one hundred and twenty two thousand dollars or twenty hundred twenty two million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| There is language on page 18 and between 16 and 18 and the others that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| Under existing law this bond and income therefrom are exempt from all present state county and municipal taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| Blah blah except for a couple exceptions like excise taxes and franchise taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| That's not actually accurate in that this bond document seems to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| that you have a choice to go with the buy america bond program that will make them taxable or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5652)|
| 1:34:18| Go with your traditional municipal that won't make them taxable. I'm concerned that this language actually makes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5658)|
| 1:34:25| warranty or a promise or something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| Some idiot downstream will claim that we've misled them and and get us in liability trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| Is there any way we can clear up that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| So it's clear that if we don't adopt the buy america approach then under existing law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| This bond is exempt from taxes, but right now it's inconsistent with the whole proposal here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| You got two routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| You can go with buy america and taxable bonds probably at a higher rate or with the government financing some thirty percent of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| or municipal bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| Which are tax exempt and have an advantage to the purchaser of the bond of not paying tax on the income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5695)|
| 1:35:01| And i'm just concerned that this language may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| May actually mislead someone can we clarify it? Maybe it's legal's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| Maybe it's your bond council, but it looks like we took out something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| We've done in the past and didn't recognize that distinction and I hope i'm wrong, but we need to deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5710)|
| 1:35:16| Well the the build america bond program obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| For if those bonds are sold as babs or build america bonds, then the holder on that is subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| The interest that they would earn on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| Bond to pay federal income taxes. Yes, sir. That is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| And this is a resolution of the city council in this page 18 as part of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| You're signing it as our agent, but we have the city saying something that's not technically accurate as far as i'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| And I and i'm i'm worried about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| I think which I read the whole document and parsed it and didn't fall asleep and kill yourself and fall on your pen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| You would get the point that you can go to a or b| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| but I think the language is almost a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| Form of a of a certification that this is a tax exempt bond under existing law and it depends which way you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5760)|
| 1:36:07| Well, joe airs might be able to answer. Mr. Ayers. Would you answer the question financial advisor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| Joe airs morgan keegan 11 400 park side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| Uh the section you're referencing sir is the form of the bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| And if the bonds are issued as taxable build america bonds the form would be changed to reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| The option of those bonds under either option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| The bonds will be exempt from all the tennessee related taxes since being issued by tennessee municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| The only federal the only change would be the federal designation. Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| You're saying that language is operative only for the form of the bond. That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| I want to congratulate you on your stamina as i've read through these bond documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| I I don't know that I could stay awake very often reading through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| There is very technical important important language in there, but it is mind-numbing, uh to some degree. Thank you, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5810)|
| 1:36:58| So you think that's purely a form of the non-taxable municipal bond if you go that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| That is correct. Do you have a form for the other one in this document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| For the by america bond. In other words, did you did you put both forms in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| I think the way it's the operative language in there is some of the language is bracketed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| and then the section that talks about to the extent that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| City elects to do the taxable build america bonds that bond council revises the forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| With their with their opinion. Thank you, and and I understand for purposes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| These three approvals that are coming up and I guess this is for mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| Walker is that this is these are each pledged on the revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| That come from kub's particular operating system, whether it's electrical waste water or the third one gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5860)|
| 1:37:47| And not from the city of knoxville's tax base and it says that no owner of the bond may pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| Uh, the city's taxable. There is a statement in each bond resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| That says the bondholders have no recourse to the taxation power of the city. That is I think that's an important provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| I think that makes it easier for us to act on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| One other question exhibit a on this first one that we're looking at 11a at the bottom of the page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| It says to finance the cost of improvements betterments and extensions to the water system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| And someone copied something from some other document and didn't excise it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| But if you look at the bottom of exhibit a to this number 11a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| You will find that form of a typo if someone needs to clean that up before it hits the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| We will change that sir. All right. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| Thank you, I if I could ask you one other question and that is you guys have a fairly large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| Debt load here. I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| 138 million outstanding in the electrical system and throw 30 on top of it. You're at 168 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5919)|
| 1:38:46| Going back to 2004 to the present. Do you feel comfortable that your revenue stream is going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| Fairly retire these yes, sir. We do we have a long-term financial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| That calculates shows pro forma financials throughout the next five to ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| And we've shared that with our rating agencies standard importers and moody's and it shows very strong debt service coverages or the revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5941)|
| 1:39:08| Are able to cover that debt many times over so we feel very strongly that it's a prudent amount of debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| I commend you on that. Thank you, sir. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=5954)|

| 1:41:01| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| It shines for you. Mr. Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| If I could ask mr. Walker just briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| We've already cleared up several of the items you're asking for 80 million dollars. It's for the wastewater system revenue bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6068)|
| 1:41:15| You're under a consent decree where you've got to do this stuff over 10 years and you've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| Hacking away at it. Uh, and I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| It sounds like some of the work you're doing does not provide additional revenue to the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| but in fact cures a problem that the courts thought you had to cure which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| Wastewater getting away into the stormwater systems and whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| Uh, is that correct? That is correct. All right. I'm looking at page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| I guess one of the resolution that shows that the outstanding amount is 334 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| If I added that up correctly and you're heaping another 80 million on that and that's for the fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6107)|
| 1:41:54| that is coming up and ending in in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| the fall of uh, the summer of 2011, I guess my concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6117)|
| 1:42:05| Are your revenues going to be covering this are you going to have to have rate increases? Where are we going with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| I'm, not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| I this wasn't as clear to me because you weren't creating an extending service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| But you're kind of patching a problem. You have to you're under a court order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| But what's the implications of this amount of bonded debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| Which looks to me like 414 million dollars if we approve this by the time we're done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| Yes, sir. Um the consent decree as you pointed out does bring with it extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| Mandated capital investments over a 10 and even a 15 year period in total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| Well over half a billion close to 700 million dollars in mandated investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| When we first came under the order, we developed a long-term funding plan, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| Which included a significant amount of debt over a 10 to 15 year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| So the debt we've issued to date since the consent degree is consistent with our original funding plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6171)|
| 1:42:57| Which we we've visited the rating agencies with and continue to revisit with them every time we have a bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| And it does our long-term financial plan does show that our coverages our revenues are sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| To be able to cover the debt and meet the bond covenant requirements for servicing the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| All right, and that so that you just told me that this is a fiscally sound level of debt for you to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| Can you tell me whether this will include future rate increases to help carry the debt? Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| It will in fact, we've since we've been under the consent decree. We've already had significant rate increases several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| I know we had 250 percent increases one in 2005 one in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| And eight percent in 2008 and our financial plan calls for approximately a 12 percent rate increase every other year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| for the duration of the consent decree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| is there any indication that that that at some point you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101102?start=6224)|
