| 0:00:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=0)|
| 0:00:02| All right, the Rules Committee has now been called to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=2)|
| 0:00:05| Commissioner McKenzie is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=5)|
| 0:00:06| Commissioner Olenby is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=6)|
| 0:00:08| Commissioner Smith is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=8)|
| 0:00:09| And Commissioner Anders is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=9)|
| 0:00:13| All right, the first item on the agenda is consideration of a change in the rules of Knox County Commission regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=13)|
| 0:00:17| the commission's meeting structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=17)|
| 0:00:20| No, I think we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=20)|
| 0:00:21| As long as it's recorded, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=21)|
| 0:00:26| And we'll take notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=26)|
| 0:00:27| Has anybody ever been given this piece of paper that documents the requested role of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=27)|
| 0:00:37| Have you all seen that, looked at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=37)|
| 0:00:40| This would eliminate redundancy in the agenda as it's printed to the public and to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=40)|
| 0:00:49| Does anybody have any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| It's just that, and I don't, you know, no one knows how the flow is going to go from now on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=53)|
| 0:01:01| but I think you had mentioned at one point the dead time between the 2 o'clock meeting ending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=61)|
| 0:01:09| and 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| And my question is, maybe it's to the law director, can we put a placeholder in here that says any additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=70)|
| 0:01:18| committees and whatnot can meet given the proper notice in between these two times in case, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=78)|
| 0:01:25| that way the public will know that there might come a day that we'll say we're going to meet at 430 because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=85)|
| 0:01:32| done with the commission meeting and we'll meet on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| So is that appropriate just to put a placeholder here, just some informational things to say that we reserve the right to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=97)|
| 0:01:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| In the past, I've suggested that you put, for instance, on or about or no later than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| As long as the general public is on notice and people can't later say, I would have come to this meeting if someone had told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=114)|
| 0:02:01| really the law gives you wide latitude in the manner in which you conduct public business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=121)|
| 0:02:09| I think that's a, we can, are you talking about like a rules committee meeting instead of having all the dead time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| I think we can add those as needed without having to be on the rules for the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| Anybody have any recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=143)|
| 0:02:33| On this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| Mr. Chairman, you know, last time we got out of the meeting quite early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| I would consider, if you want to look sometime, maybe if we don't have a lot on the agenda, moving it to 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| Well, I think we discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| I think that having that allowance in there allows us to have a long meeting if we need to have a long meeting during budget times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=170)|
| 0:02:58| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| I think as inconvenient as it may be and zoning is being at six so the public can show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| I think it's unfortunate but fortunate we have that time there for long meetings, in my opinion, as much as I'd like to meet at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| And this is something we can look at maybe the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| But if we see that we've got a lot of dead time in between the meetings, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| then I think it would help quite a few of us if we did sort of crunch it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| Otherwise, we're just roaming around downtown after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| Yeah, you know, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| And with us doing all the honorariums early before 2, I think in time we're going to have some dead time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| You know, move everything up two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| If the agenda looks like that we're not going to have a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| I'm not a member of the committee, but if you start jacking around and having things different times every time, it's going to confuse people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| It looks deceptive on its face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| Any recommendations on the improvements to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| Agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Agenda item one passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Consideration of a change of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Knox County Commission required any items added to the agenda after the monthly deadline be approved by the commission chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=257)|
| 0:04:25| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| Any second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Ann Acuff may have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| She spoke with me four or five days ago, not aware of this meeting, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| And she's got some suggestions which might make her job more productive and more efficient about the line item transfers, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=277)|
| 0:04:45| Is that right, Ann?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Ann Acuff, Knox County Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| I would just like to ask the committee to consider moving the deadline forward one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| That would give everybody a little extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Currently, our deadline is the first Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| And then previously, the agenda meeting was that Wednesday following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| But now we don't have the agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| So if we move it to the second Monday, I think that probably would cut down on the items to be added and it would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=308)|
| 0:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Jolie, do you have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| We may not have an agenda committee, but we still have an agenda and resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| and information to put together for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| What if we, now for the law department, for our office, it makes it cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| But what if we put the line item transfers on their own deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| We'll just move that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Yeah, just the line item transfers to the second Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| Does anybody have an objection to that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| I'll make that as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| Yes, I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| Second on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| All in favor of the agenda or the line item with amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| Discussion regarding the order of the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| I think that really was discussed under number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| I think we want to look at, come back and look at times later on in the calendar year, maybe after the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| Let's go through the budget process and then discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Because I think the budget process is going to cause our meetings to go long if anything else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| You know, I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| We'll just let it float for a few months and see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| But if this is consistent and it's only doing that two, maybe three months that we're dealing with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| then we may want to adjust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| But I'm like Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| I don't want to jerk the meetings around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=421)|
| 0:07:01| Question on this, and I don't know what Commissioner Hammond had in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| but I know there was some discussion on the commission lunch, the chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| Do we want to discuss pushing that back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| I know several of you all are on the pension board, and I know that was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| I think the pension board met for ten minutes today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| So they had a lot of down time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| It was probably push 25 or something, but an hour and a half, a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| But traditionally it's about an hour, a little over an hour probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| What were you talking about taking the lunch to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Well, I know at one point you guys meet at what time, ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| Ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| And what did you meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Six, conference room at six o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| I mean, I'm fine with 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| I just thought that was an issue with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| I was just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| I think Commissioner Hammond had something in mind here, so I was just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| Yeah, he had passed a proposal out last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| Last meeting was 1115 to 1230 was the chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| 1230 to one was a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| At one o'clock a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| 130, hopefully a break if the beer board budget is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| And then 145, public forum for non-agenda items and honorariums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| And then a two o'clock commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| That's what we had discussed taking it back to 1130, I think is what we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| I think the speaker is going to be at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| So the 1115 may be time to get in and say hello, get your lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| So if he wants to, if we want to move that to 1130, 1115 to 1130, I think is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| The speaker is not going to start until 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| Is there any other business to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| I have one suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| I'm sorry, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Dr. Briggs first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Yeah, I was just going to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| You know, we're talking about the long deliberations that go on with the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| And I think Paul Pinkston has pointed this out last year is that we have separate, you know, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| I think we're supposed to have a separate hearing on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| So the deliberations that we do in the actual commission meeting, the time you have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| and then those special, specially called meetings, the meetings aren't necessarily going to be any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| That was the only thing I was going to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| When we get the workshop agenda, it doesn't have the zonings on the bottom, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| and I talked to Joe Lee and it's on the agenda when it comes out the first of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=578)|
| 0:09:45| Maybe we don't get to that or we forgot it by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| But this month particularly we had one issue that came up that really is not coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| but at that time I didn't know that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| And I assumed it was going to be on the agenda about the liquor store out to North Shore down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| because it wasn't on the workshop agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| It's not on until the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| We started getting email before we knew that there was a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| So she says that won't be a problem to add that to that if that's agreeable with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| I think, John, yeah, I think that's, I don't think that's a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| I think we just add that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| But this kind of gives us a heads up if there's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Yeah, because I started getting emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| I thought it was a BZA issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| I didn't think it was a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| It ends up being the city, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| The town center is in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| For a liquor store, it has to be in the city, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| For a liquor store, not liquor by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Yes, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| So I was, some people called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| I said, well, I understand your position, but I would suggest you call the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| On item number 13 on that order of agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Are we going to move away from public forum like we've been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| I think we're going to have it in two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| The beginning at the 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Okay, we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| And then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| So it's really public forum before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| I mean, it's not during.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| It's not a part of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| And if they want to speak to an item on agenda, they can wait until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025rules?start=680)|
