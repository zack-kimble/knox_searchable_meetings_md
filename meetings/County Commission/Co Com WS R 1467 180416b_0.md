| 0:09:02| and as an alternate member to the Knox County Sheriff's Office Merit System Council, resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| Commissioner Brownlee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| I see that Gina Oster is here on 12 and 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| and I think she is also a member of the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| and are there other committees that she's a member of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| I believe that's it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| That's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| So does the mayor pick these names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Who's picking her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| I believe we have voted on her to be on the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| She's on the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Yes, she started as an alternate, I believe, and then moved up to a regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| Somebody dropped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| But on the next one, that would be the property assessor that appointed or recommended her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=589)|
| 0:09:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Is it Mr. Cruz, Mr. Chairman, may I be recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Is it KRUSE who's retiring, and she's stepping up into the slot of his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| which ends her term on April the 30th, and she becomes from an alternate to a member of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| And then we have to pick one from the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| We have to pick one from the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| Or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| So we move to no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Okay. Do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| I make a motion to move with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=636)|

| 0:10:52| for professional surveying and engineering design services related to the new entrance to IC King Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| along Merrill Pike SR 33 resolution 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| I'd like to make a motion to approve, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| I just wanted to ask one question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| Mr. Snowden, how are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| I'm good, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Was this money that was allotted into this park whenever we first decided to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| This is in the budget for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| I just wanted to make sure everybody was clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Can we have a proper motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Mr. Snowden, it looks like the original contract was like $35,000 or $32,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| It's now gone up about 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| So did they just not bid this properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| How did we get from one RF, one quote, and then now it's about 60% higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| That's a real good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| And the reason being is if you're familiar with Merrill Pike at the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| there's an existing gravel driveway there that we had originally hoped to use for the access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| Once we started looking into it further, the line of sight for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| to get the proper sight distance we would have to obtain right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Maybe you can build a retaining wall on the other side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| So we ended up moving the access point further to, I guess, the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| which required more survey, more design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| but it saved us the cost of acquiring that property and building a retaining wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| So at the end of the day, we are spending a little more money here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| but it will save us in the construction cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Okay. And Commissioner Daley, you're good with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| Yeah, absolutely. I get questions all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Where are we going to start it? Where are we going to start it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| And just like Mr. Snowden said, that is coming out of a sharp curve just past Mount Olive Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| And our only choice was to move it down to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| and that will be the best place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| We'll have turning lanes, correct, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Correct. There will be a left-turn lane in for northbound traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| and a right-turn decel for southbound traffic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| Very good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| We have a proper motion and a second before us. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Opposed say no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=787)|

| 0:13:37| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| They're here. Can we give them an opportunity to present what they got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| If they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| We'll pay them by the hour anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Sure. I'll make it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| I've got a lot of notes here and can answer a lot of questions, but let me just recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| I was here about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| Actually, not quite a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Back in July before the Finance Committee and really set to say what we were going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| and make sure that you all knew what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| My name is Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| I'm President of the Development Corporation of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| That's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Our address is 17 Market Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| The intent is to use tax increment financing as a tool to create a revenue stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=858)|
| 0:14:27| to help pay for the improvements that we're getting ready to put into the Carnes Valley Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| That's about $3.6 to $3.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| We project that it's going to take 13 to 14 years of a revenue stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| based on kind of a staggered two-year step of the different parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=881)|
| 0:14:56| Improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| The park itself is going to be, when it's developed, about 65 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| It will create up to four parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| I suspect it will really develop more like in three parcels ranging in size from 13 to 35 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| It's a very good site in that once the Carnes Valley Drive connector is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| that will provide access to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| It's got a very large water line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| There's two of them that run through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| It's got natural gas that's very close to it as well as sanitary sewer and an LCB substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| So we feel like it's an ideal piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| that the use of taxing and refinancing is a way to create a revenue stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| that it generates its own revenue not only to do additional work with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| that becomes necessary but additional phases for other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| Once complete, we expect that the project is going to generate at least 561 direct jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| and another 722 indirect jobs, about $33.8 million in annual wages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| $2.3 million annually in new local taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| and from those wages and about $280,000 in just ad valorem taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| So that's obviously why communities get involved in developing Business Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| is for those wages and those jobs and the local taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| and ultimately creating the standard of living and quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| The project in addition to just the site layout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| will also have a perimeter trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| It's over a mile long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| In the northwest corner there will be a trailhead parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| This doesn't really represent how nice it's going to be, but in that corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| so that people that live in that general area will be able to drive there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| as well as on the south side through Carnes High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| to be able to access and use that as well as the Business Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| people that are in the Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| The resolution is actually in your board package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| What it does is it authorizes and requests that the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| move forward with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| It acknowledges receiving the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| that this is something that Knox County wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| but it doesn't intend to spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| so it's willing to use the incremental taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| that will be generated by this project to help repay for the cost of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| and it speeds up that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Then it asks the Industrial Development Board to consider it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| and create an economic impact plan for up to 20 years per parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| when it comes on for that increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| I don't think it will take that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| but that's the maximum amount without special exception from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| that you can use for a period of time for tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| Next steps after that, it would go back to the Industrial Development Board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| Application Review Committee for a little further vetting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| to develop the economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| It would go to their full board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| and ultimately before it actually becomes enacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| it would come back to this body for final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| It's actually the economic impact plan and approval of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| that sets forth and sets in motion tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| allowing those to flow for the recapture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| It's not the magic bullet that solves all the things that we're going to need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| to be able to continue to do business part development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| and things that support that in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| but it is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| It's better, I believe, than bonded deadness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| as a source of that same amount of revenue or source of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| We're going to move forward with the project regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| It's what you want us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| It's what's needed in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| but I believe that this is something that should be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| and it's a tool that's there, and it's a good way for us to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| I have a whole lot of other information beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| I can talk about exactly how TIPS work and the numbers and all that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| Most of that's in your packages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| but I guess with that I will just stop and take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Todd, on the 35 acres, how big of a business could we look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| Are we looking like a lifetime, which is probably our biggest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| Lifetime, probably not lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Lifetime, as it expanded, was about 800,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| You could fit about a 450,000 square foot facility on that if you incorporated kind of. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1159)|
| 0:19:28| If you were to take site one and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| you could probably get up to maybe five or six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| but on site two, as it's shown right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| about 400,000 to 500,000 square foot would be about as much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| would be reasonably expected on a parcel that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| The trucking company, I don't remember the name that went to Hamlin County last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| would this then benefit for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| They're on about 100. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| You know, I think it could accommodate the phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| but they ultimately wound up on, I think, a 160-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| I don't think it has to be as big as that to accommodate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| but I don't know that it could accommodate the first phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| but I don't think they would have gone there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| because they would have looked for additional land for ultimate build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| They'd probably look for something closer to the interstate, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| I had that question asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| We do not have the land available for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| About the only place that we have currently that could accommodate something of that magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| would be out in East Bridge, where we've got about 120 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Mr. Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| I have a question under the resolution, which is on page 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| that I need somebody to help me understand what that says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| The proposed public infrastructure improvements are of such importance to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| that the commission will consider waiving the normal policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| of requiring the applicant to make the infrastructure improvements at its expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| Do you want me to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Sure, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Typically when a development is done by anyone in Knox County, they go do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| And so what it is saying is that they feel like it's important enough that we use tax increment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| basically waive its collection of those increments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| and put those back into the project to help recover the cost of that is what it's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| So rather than collecting those into the general fund, they go back out to the project cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Yes, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| In your application for the TIF on page A5, you've requested a 20-year TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| and yet it says your policy is a maximum of 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| Did you all have to do a rule change for the way you're doing TIFs from here on out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| So the 20 years is the state policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| and the Industrial Development Board set up its own internal guidance policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| It has the ability to waive that, and it's going to be a request of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| and that will be part of going through that application review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Do you think this will be ongoing where other entities will request going from 15 years to 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| They may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| I feel like this whole, you know, I'd have to, and I can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Ultimately, when the TIF legislation was set up back in 2000, 2004, 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| it was actually set up initially for use by organizations like the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| as a means to legally get back, you know, sources of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| What ultimately, though, was written broadly enough that the people that were using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| wound up using it were retail developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| and the first one we got was South Grove Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| Then we got one out off Tilesville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| and it was like these were coming pretty fast and furious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| So Knox County Industrial Development Board took it upon itself to put some parameters in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| to try to give itself some guidance on how it wanted to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| So that is a completely different type of animal than what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| This is really, that's typically a private developer for profit that's doing something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| and there are components that are deemed to be public improvements that are also needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| but really the genesis of the development is really for maybe it's a Lowe's Anchor development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| or, you know, something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| So I don't anticipate that because of the nature of the type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| that we're applying this to versus in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| I would say that I have said for a period of time that I felt like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| it was our attempt back in the day, back in the mid-2000s to try to deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| that it's probably too tight in several regards because ultimately what it wound up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| the only thing that could meet that policy was a retail development because of the value that it generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| So I think there's some room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| That's a whole different deal for the IDB to deal with, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Commissioner Nashner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Thank you, Todd, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| I remember when we first talked about this, I guess where I grasped it logically in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| we as a community are investing a lot of money in the Industrial Development Board in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| and we want to make sure that you always have some dry powder to be able to go after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| and pursue properties and tactics that can help grow jobs in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1469)|
| 0:24:36| This tip that you've proposed to me, at its simplest way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| is a way to help us reimburse ourselves via you for doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| putting in this infrastructure for this type of development, which would have been done right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| but I'm looking at it as more of an opportunity cost for the future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| where I'd rather see some of the money come back in where it can then be redeployed back into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| I'm not sure what the next opportunity is going to be in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| but my take on this is this is giving you a tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| or you're the person that replaces you in the future when you retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| to help have some funding available to do the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| It creates a source of revenue funding short of having to kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| because what happens otherwise, the only other way you could do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| would be Knox County would have to set up a special fund and say it's going to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| and it's going to set that aside and kind of keep it in its own little reserve account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| and not touch it when things get okay, we need money for this or we need money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| So it is an alternative way of funding this incrementally through the revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| that this specific project, which is Business Park Development, funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| Any further questions for Mr. Napier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Okay, we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Item number 44 is a resolution approving a five-year lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| between Knox County, Tennessee and Clifford, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| for the premises located at 1645 Downtown West Boulevard, Unit 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| and Downtown West Shopping Center to be used for early voting, training classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| storage of election equipment, and general office use by the Knox County Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| This is resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Okay, I make a motion that we pass this with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Cliff, would you like to come up and say a few words, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Clifford Rogers, Administrator of Elections for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| Personal Address 3526 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| I wanted to give you all an updated status report because when I was here four weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| never in my wildest dreams did I not think we would have a lease for you all to look at by this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| and it is not because we haven't been working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| I have been working hard with the law director's office, the leasing agent at Downtown West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| I've spent ten hours in meetings on a 17-page lease, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| So we have not been dragging our feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| We have parsed over every syllable, every letter of this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| We're going to get it right, but I need the law director's seal of approval on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| I want it approved as to form so that you all will have a little better sense of confidence about the lease next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1646)|
| 0:27:34| But I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| I need you to vote on it next week because if we don't get it in place next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| we don't have a prayer getting all the work done on that facility in the old Kampai of Tokyo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| so that we can be early voting in there in July for the August election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| When I was here before, my concern was they're using up all the space down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| You remember we talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Well, that's just one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| In light of what's happened last week with all of the conflict and tension and drama| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| regarding signage and tents out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| I can almost represent with complete assurance at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| that that landlord is not going to let us have any more space for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| So it is very fortuitous that we started this process when we did for one purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| but it turns out now we've got two things to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| So I just wanted to indicate to you today how urgent the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| My apology for not having something in place any sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| I've done my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| In case you didn't know, we've got an election going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| I've been kind of busy the last few days, but we're doing our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| So I'm going to get that draft of that lease hopefully to you in the next day or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| and then I'll be down here to address any particular concerns, questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| or anything else that you all have next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| But you all need to know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| It's really important to me and to the voters in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| You all know how busy it is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Sir, since you touched the subject, I'll ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| are you getting any other complaints about our early voting locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| and the amount of signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| I know Commissioner Daley has mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| Succinctly put, the signs are the bane of my existence right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| I have never seen so many signs and had so many complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| I mean, and let's face it, they're an abomination of the first order out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| They're an assault on the census to have this many signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| Never in the seven years I've been doing this have I seen this many signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| And you all have gotten elected before, most of you up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| and we all know that sign ain't going to get you elected, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| And I'm just going to ask, you know, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| we're going to have to have some reasonable restrictions on these signs if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| Keep in mind, downtown west, that's private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| You know, it's a free-for-all in all these county properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| And I can't do anything on the other side of that 100-foot boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| But, yes, Mr. Chairman, it is a problem like I have never seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| I'll say ditto to that, and I'd like to see us come up with a sensible solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| Two signs, three signs are plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| But, Cliff, just for my clarification, you will have the lease to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| be approved by the law director, then we will get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| That's the order, and I've already forwarded it to Charlie Sturkey late this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| I was on the phone until 4.30 trying to get the last details, and I've got the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| And so that's my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Unless there's something unforeseen, I have every expectation to have that next 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| Commissioner Braley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| I wonder if you could include in that lease the number of signs that you could put on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| Here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| We're going to put something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| What I have represented to them, there's only so much authority I have about those signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| but we're going to put on our website whatever reasonable restrictions we come up on the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| and we're still working on that because you've got to talk about the size of the sign, how many signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| So we are going to do what we can to get it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| And I told the landlord, I think the good folks here in Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| if we tell them this is what we expect them to do, I think most candidates are going to be relieved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| and go, thank goodness, I only have to put up two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| I don't have to get in a war thinking that this election is going to be won| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| on me having one more sign than my opponent over here because we all know it's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| So we're going to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| I don't know if I can make it part of the lease because I don't know how it can be binding on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| but I'm going to put on that website whatever we can come up with that's reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| and I'm praying the good folks here will follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| You're not having any sign problem at your early voting location at the Farragut Town Hall, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| No, they know how to restrict signs out there, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| They sure do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| One sign a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| One sign per candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| There's a lot of casualties out there on the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| They just pile them up in the trucks and off they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| Not my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| I think it would be a good idea, going back to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| I think it would be a good idea if we as a county looked at part of that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| and looked at the one, two-by-four, four-by-four at each location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| I think it's a wise thing to do, especially on private property, churches, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| I think we need to exercise some due caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| So in the summer I think we should all propose that as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| You know, they gave us free use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Well, no, I take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| We are paying something for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| But those signs that are in the city right-of-way, all somebody has to do is call the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| The city will go up there and take them up because the city's ordinance is no signs, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| Am I correct, Cliff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| What's complicated everything, as it always does, is a ruling by the United States Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| Basically you all have got an ordinance that says no signs in the right-of-way in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| Same thing for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| And then you say, now 30 days before the election, okay, now you can put out the political signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| Well, the Supreme Court says you can't distinguish among the signs, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| So the way I think a lot of people are looking at that means you don't get that exception to the rule for political signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| If you say no signs in the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| then you can't have the plumbing sign or the electrical sign advertising their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| but you can't have the political signs either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| Maybe we can just get rid of all of them in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| Wouldn't that be nice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| But I'll let the law director, and he's got fine people up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| but it is a problem because of the way that Supreme Court case came in last year on how we interpret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| But I think we can do something, and I hope we can do better than what we've got going on out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2039)|
| 0:34:12| Okay, we had a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| We never voted on it, did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Motion to move that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| We got off track there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Item number 46 is consideration of the closure of a recorded but not improved portion of Raindrop Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2076)|

| 0:34:50| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Okay, do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| I think we had somebody to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| I'll make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Veronica Douglas, Ms. Douglas, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2105)|
| 0:35:22| Veronica Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| Can we move it until the end of our agenda in case she went to the restroom or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| I don't want her to come all the way down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| My name is Sean Chalmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| I'm part of the party that requested the road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| I actually spoke with her earlier, and she left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| She had no concerns after we spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| She was concerned about the road actually remaining open because she lives on the other end of Raindrop Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| Okay, I guess she lives in Cambridge Woods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Okay, it's really technically not a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| It's not built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Brad, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| And you are the family that owns the land that has requested it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| I represent the owners of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| All right, so we have a motion to approve and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Item number 47 is consideration of a closure of a recorded but not improved alleyway between 10817 2nd Street and 1000-1004 Olive Road in the Old Concord Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2182)|
| 0:36:38| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| Mr. Snowden, can you come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| Jim, just an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| How can I help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Jim Snowden, North County Engineering, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| Just an observation of looking at the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| There's a lot of these little kind of odd alleys in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| A little history on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| No, that subdivision dates back, I think, into the teens, so I'm not familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| It certainly predates my tenure at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| But there are a lot of alleyways through there, and this one, it doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| There's no roadbed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| It doesn't look like the topography would have even allowed for a road to be constructed at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| So I can't really speak to why it may have been platted in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| A lot of them look like driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| So there's never been anything done at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| No, it is a grass field between two yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Could that go back 100 years when that was the old race park, horse racing park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| It very well could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| I didn't look at the Dieter Platt maps, but that community does have a lot of older facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Item number 48 is consideration of the closure of a portion of Twin Creek Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2299)|

| 0:38:31| Mr. Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| We have two, a Reverend Harris and a Jillian Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| Good evening, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| I'm Reverend Harris, pastor of the Harris Chapel Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| I spoke back in March a few weeks ago about the closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| the impact that we feel it would have on the church, limiting the access from Martin Mill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2333)|
| 0:39:02| Some of our members come out from the city, out Martin Mill Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| and would have to divert and go around to John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| And we understand that someone said, well, it's only two or three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| but those two or three minutes that we're asked to go around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| John Sevier Highway is a very dangerous highway that has high speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Trying to access John Sevier in the mornings, if you live out in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| you'll know exactly in the early mornings, also in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| tremendous traffic coming from both directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| coming east and coming west back up John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| So we feel, I guess, that the closure is just past our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| It would put us on a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| And some of the Knox County sheriffs have talked to us that we know what happens on dead end streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| Especially, we are very isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Many of you got to come out to visit our area, and you know how isolated the area is already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| So we feel that that would just put us in more jeopardy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| especially for the ambulance service that might have to be called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| emergency services that would come from town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| They would then have to go completely around, and you say, well, that's only two or three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| But two or three minutes with a person that's needing help can be the difference between life or death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| We had an episode with my mother, so I know what seconds can do with someone that's really in emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| So we just feel that we need as much access as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| The road even coming from John Sevier is very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Many of you that got to come out to walk the site probably could see by your drive-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| So those are some of the reasons that we are against the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| And I think also not only on the regards of the limited access, but that is one of the oldest roads in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2458)|
| 0:41:10| That road was an old wagon road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| Our church was first established in 1878.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| This year will be our 140th year at that particular place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| I grew up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| My father grew up there on Browns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| We call it Browns Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| His father grew up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| So I have a great deal of history in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| We were the only first when I started high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| Me and my brother and my cousins, the Henrys, are the only black people that attended Doyle High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| So we've been in the community a long time, and I just feel it would be a shame to lose that road and lose that access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2502)|
| 0:41:52| Many of the people also have told me that I went around to each of the neighbors after our first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| and asked their opinions on the closure of the road, and they said no one had even contacted them about the closing of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| And many people that I went to, I went to each resident on Twin Creek and also on Harris Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| and they said we just want the dump cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| We didn't think that it meant the closure of the road permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| So everyone that I talked to said we thought that it was just a temporary closure to clean the dump up and then it would be reopened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2537)|
| 0:42:25| I said no, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| So I have a signed petition with those names that I've given to the commission for you to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| And we just ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Also, many people I talked to said, well, it ain't going to do any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| My opinion doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| And a lot of times I think that comes from they don't feel that they have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| They don't feel that they'll be listened to or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| So I just hope that you would take what they have, take it in consideration before you make a decision that impacts them directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2569)|
| 0:43:01| Because it's one thing if you don't live on the road, you might have a totally different feeling than if you actually lived there on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2581)|
| 0:43:10| So I just hope that the commission would consider that in your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| And I have some of the residents that are here that live on Twin Creek and Harris Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| and they could probably, if you would allow them to speak for themselves, or if you want to hear from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| you can talk to them and see their opinions or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| But I just hope that you give that consideration to them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Would you have them stand so we can see who they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| I have two back here, Roger and the older lady here that spoke at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| And I think also over here, Mr. Henry, is here that lives on Harris Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| So if you'd like to hear from those, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Mr. Harris, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Can I ask him a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Reverend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| You said you had a list of names that had signed a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Is that the one that you sent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| And I have the hard copy if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Mrs. Brott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Would you like to speak, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| You'll have to come down to the mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2667)|
| 0:44:48| If you would, ma'am, give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2688)|
| 0:44:56| You'll probably have to pull that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| My name is Juanita Brite, and I live at 1814 Harris Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2699)|
| 0:45:08| That's right off of Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2708)|
| 0:45:16| I don't know what else to add to what the reverend said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| but we wanted our dump cleaned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| and when we asked that they clean the dump, for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| they thought that meant close our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| Everybody out there was okay with a temporary closure until they cleaned it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2739)|
| 0:45:51| But they kept some things from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| and we didn't even know about a meeting where they had decided to close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2754)|
| 0:46:03| It was a big surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| We expected it to be closed maybe a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| They'd get that dump cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| They'd put a little black top on our road, and we'd be back in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| That's not the way it's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| They went behind our backs, and they're going to close the road permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| They don't live out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| They don't use that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| They don't know how those people that live in the area depend on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| That's a quick way for us to get down to Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| to the grocery store, to our doctor office, into town to pay our bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2810)|
| 0:46:59| do our banking, grocery shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| You all don't live out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| You don't use our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| We need it, and we want it back opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| Clean that dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| Do what you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| What's been neglected for years and years, and we've lived with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2845)|
| 0:47:34| Hadn't even started complaining until just recently when it got so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| When you see 15 mattresses stacked up at the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| when you see all these automobile tires dumped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| those people that are doing it are coming from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| They're not coming from our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| They're not part of us, and they don't care about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| They didn't give a second thought to that thing they just dumped, TVs, furniture, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2888)|
| 0:48:17| We don't want their garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| We didn't ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| We just ask now that it be took away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| Get the garbage cleaned up, and I don't care if you don't do anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| Patch the holes in the road a little bit, but we'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| We want our road back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| We want that road opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| We're willing to wait on you to do what you've got to do, but no permanent closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| That's not what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| You all came out and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| We're a poor neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| We don't have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| If we did, we'd probably do it ourself just to avoid this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| but we don't have the means to do it, and we're asking for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| We pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| They don't blacktop our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| They don't cut the bushes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| They don't get the fallen trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| That's left up to us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| The people that live there have to keep the roads cleared, cleaned out so you can drive on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| County don't do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| We quit asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Do it yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| If you're not able, see if another neighbor can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| We want the dump cleaned, like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| A little bit of blacktop put on that road and give us our road back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| We don't need all this fancy stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| We don't care if they can't two-lane it and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| It's been this way for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| Ma'am, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Do you need more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| I'd be willing to give you more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| I'm going to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| That's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Open our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Get the dump cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| Open our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| Commissioner Schoenmacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| I have a quick question for Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| I think I woke him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| I think I woke him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| You did a great job of giving us a printout at the public meeting that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| what, a week ago Friday, I guess it was, or whenever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| With the time changes, I mean, the travel distances and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| The other question I had was, right in front of the dump site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| what is the width of the asphalt there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| Because you can't get two cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| You know, I don't think I specifically measured it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| but just from looking at it, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| it's probably in the neighborhood of 12 to 14 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| So you cannot pass two vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Did you want to just review the times that you had on this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| that you gave the commissioners that were present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Yes, and I'd actually updated some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| I think emailed it to all of you since that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| But, yeah, we did a traffic count at the location coming down the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| where most of the dumping has occurred prior to the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| And the average daily traffic of that was 74 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| There were some days it was a little less, some days a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| but the average cars per day on the road were 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| The a.m. peak hour was from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m., and it had eight cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| And the p.m. peak hour was from 2 to 3 p.m., and it had a total of 18 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| So there's 74 cars a day on the road, typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| is what we would anticipate from a daily traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| I guess I'll comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| I want to follow up with the email that I sent out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| because the original petition was signed by 19 members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| that lived on that road or were directly impacted from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| and they wanted to make sure we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| that it's an adverse impact on their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| accessibility to their homes, their place of worship, and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| But I also want to make sure we follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| with where we stand on cleaning this dump up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3185)|
| 0:53:20| Commissioner, we haven't taken any steps to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| and get a competitive solicitation or a bid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| until the issue of the road being opened or closed is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| Should the road remain open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| we'll certainly get in and identify a scope of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| that will try to get the dump area as clean as it possibly can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| But I would encourage this commission to limit the expenditure of public dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| as much as possible on the dump because if you do not close the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| it's largely going to be a futile effort, and that's the harsh reality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| If the road stays open, the dumping is going to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| and there's not anything that I and five code enforcement officers can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| to reverse 50 years of public behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| So once we get the issue of whether or not the road is closed resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| then we'll go forward and try to get some bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| and come back to this body for approval for funds to remediate the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| But that scope of work and what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| may depend on whether or not we think it's going to be a permanent solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| or whether it's going to be a temporary solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| So let me see if I understand this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| You're saying if we close the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| you can guarantee us that people won't just start trashing another neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| another road, dumping their stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| You know, Commissioner, I can't promise you that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| I don't know that they won't go somewhere else in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| I'd like to think they'd go to the John Sevier Convenience Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| which is open 56 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| It charges no charge to bring tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| You can bring mattresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| You can bring that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Any resident of Knox County can bring their waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| But for those folks that are willing to dump it off the side of the road at Twin Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| are they going to be willing to dump it off the side of the road somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| The difference is that the conditions at Twin Creek really facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| the ability to get in there on a narrow, dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| and very remote stretch of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| You have steep topography that allows you to roll tires off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| slide mattresses off, recliners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| Many of the members of the commission were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| They've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Those conditions don't exist in that many locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| It's particularly unique to this area, and it's gone on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| as you've heard, for an awfully long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| So it's the will of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| If you want to leave the road open, that's okay with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| But we will ask you for realistic expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| as to what is going to be our ability to prevent this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| from continuing to occur for another 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| Has the landowner ever been talked to about allowing people to dump there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| I mean, maybe they don't know people are dumping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| but have they ever tried to put up any resistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| I think that Mr. Salter, some of his staff may have had contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| but the value of the property is less than the cost of the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| It's not an issue I can force with civil remediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| because I'm going to end up owning the property anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| and then I don't want to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| So it won't serve any useful purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| The appraisal value of the property is, I think, well, you've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| It's a rocky steep ridge with no access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| Okay, and you had said that the amount of cleanup you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| will have a bearing upon if the road is open or closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| I mean, until we get dollar figures in hand, it's hard to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| We'd like to get it fully cleaned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| but it depends on how much we have to cut our way in sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| I think some of what you see on Twin Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| would have to be removed from below rather than above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| That is a complicated landscape and an expensive one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| and those kinds of services as we bid them lately have been expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| We just decided that the thing that made the most sense for cleanup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| was to sit tight and let this issue resolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| and then we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| But again, as I told this commission and the residents that were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| we're committed to cleaning it up the best that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| with the limits of topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| and whatever we come in with financially in terms of a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| But I would really, really encourage realistic expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| because I don't know if it will be one, two, three years, five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| but at some point or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| we spend $100,000 cleaning this up and we leave the road open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| somebody will be back requesting another $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| in order to correct this problem again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| I certainly cannot, with the five code enforcement officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| reverse 50 years of poor behavior on the part of the folks that use the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| Not these folks, obviously, but the folks that use the road as a dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| And it just mystifies me because John Sevier is one of our nicest facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| Commissioner Daley can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Well-run, clean, sizable facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| It is open 56 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| It's open at 7 a.m. on Saturday, 7 a.m. on Saturday until 3 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| and it's open 8 to 6 Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| And it just mystifies me that we can operate this facility that close to this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| and yet this is what we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| But we are where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| Hey, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| What are we doing when we close the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Are we taking Twin Creek from Martin Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| Are we closing it as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Let me let Jim speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| He's engineered this from the start and done a fine job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| And while Jim comes down, let me mention that Ms. Bright may not have noticed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| but there was a panel that went up a week ahead of the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| advising that the closure was going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| So before the barricades ever went up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| a panel goes up advising that the barricades are coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| advertising the initial meeting that we held here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| and doing our best to give everybody notice on the front end that a temporary closure was pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3548)|
| 0:59:20| Jim, the Howard family on Twin Creek Road is going to be landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3560)|
| 0:59:35| Does Twin Creek, does it close off at Martin Mill as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| Because we're going to landlock a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| I'd have to look back at the GIS map, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| That's what I'm looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| I don't recall that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| What we were going to do was leave the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| there's one driveway to the left-hand side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| We were going to leave his access in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| and then construct an earthen berm kind of approximately where the barricades are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3597)|
| 1:00:06| to prohibit access up the hill past his driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| And on Martin Mill Pike, there's kind of a wide spot in the road there at the shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| that there's people dumped concrete and asphalt and limbs and things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| So there's some guardrail that comes from, I guess, the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| that we were going to extend through that whole area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| to essentially prevent any access or someone getting to that area to dump there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| So we can check that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| But when I looked at it, I didn't think that we were landlocking anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| But we'll definitely look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| So are we closing it right at the church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| No, it's past the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| Okay, that may grab them then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| There's one driveway to the left, and we'll provide access to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| And then everyone else will have access to either Martin Mill or Twin Creek itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| Jim, did you check with that gentleman to make sure he was going to have a turning radius there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| for some of the equipment he would be taking in and out of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| Dwight and I met with that gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| and there's an area there about 15 or 20 feet that we can excavate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| and put in an asphalt radius that will allow for him to turn out with a trailer to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| But he's going to let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| I'm good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Jim, and maybe Tom or Dwight could answer this as well, just since you're closest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3695)|
| 1:01:45| because of the large volume of tires that have been dumped on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| is that something that the state would assist in funding the removal of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3710)|
| 1:01:56| that they've done in some other locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| My name is Tom Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I work for Knox County Solid Waste, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| We believe we have sufficient funds to remove the tires existing from state tire money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3725)|
| 1:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Okay, and anything in addition to that would be an add onto the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| Do you think the 100,000 is a very conservative number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| I think that's high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| I think we just finished the Alex Bales tire dump project, and this is smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3748)|
| 1:02:37| And it was a little over 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| I think it would be smaller, but I am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| I mean, like Jim said, I don't bid on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| I don't know all the costs in the end, but I think it would come in less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| How is accessibility at that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| In addition to when you pass the church, there is like—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| No, I was talking about the prior one you said was—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| They had to build a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| They had to build a full road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| There was no access to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| And this does have what looked like an old—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| Like a log road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Log road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| Something like that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| On the other side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Yeah, there's some access there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| And then would we pick up all the mattresses, furniture, appliances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| Would we also remove all the concrete and insulation that's been dumped on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| If we did a cleanup, we would do a full cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| We would take everything out of there that didn't belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| My question is, we close the road to clean up the dump, or we close the road—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3817)|
| 1:03:45| To close the dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| To close the dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| That's what I need to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| One of our concerns always when we clean up anything is how do we prevent it from becoming the same thing in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| And I think Dwight referenced the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| The history of the site has been going around in emails that it's actually not even known as the Twin Creek Dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| It's known as the Hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| It has its own name in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| And when you're trying to fight that—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| I've been working a long time, and I tend to simplify things to kind of get my head around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| But to me, it's like we're trying to close the Hopper is what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| and prevent people from using that spot for dumping as they have for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| And we do have a very nice convenience center right around the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| but the Hopper is open 24-7, and nobody's looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| You can dump whatever you want there anytime you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| And that's what we're concerned about, investing really precious cleanup money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3883)|
| 1:04:51| and additional tax dollars on top of the tire money when in a few years it could look virtually the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3891)|
| 1:04:59| How much tire money do you have from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| It is the number—what we get from the state each year is approximately—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3903)|
| 1:05:14| now this commissioner includes the money we reimburse for every waste tire recycled in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3914)|
| 1:05:22| and that's more than $300,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| We get about $400,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| So how much do we have left to do this type of operation with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| I'd have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| I would think we would have $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 left by June 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3933)|
| 1:05:41| and then the clock starts ticking again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| I wasn't able to join my fellow commissioners when you all made the field trip out there Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| but I did go back there on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| And I actually parked at the top of the hill where it was originally closed and walked down to the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| and then walked back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| And I guess just as we're trying to weigh this decision, when I got back in my car at the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| I started my stopwatch and drove down back around to the bottom where it was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| I did catch a red light pulling back out, which stopped me for about a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| The total time elapsed was exactly 4 minutes and 30 seconds with the red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3979)|
| 1:06:27| Just to provide some insight in terms of the actual time based on using a stopwatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3987)|
| 1:06:37| Commissioner Dayton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| I'd like to make a motion that we support and move to close Martin Mill Pike, that 1,000 feet, item 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=3999)|
| 1:06:50| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| I would like to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| I'd like to support the commissioners in their districts because they're the representative of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| but I want us all to be aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| It's a very slippery slope we start heading down when we start taking the liberties of the innocent away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4028)|
| 1:07:16| because we can't control those that are doing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| That applies to a lot of things that are going on in this country right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| If this stops the dumping, great, but it's a shame that we have to take away from other people's rights to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| I think it's very important that looking forward that we go to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| and they ask them to give us some teeth to where we can start to enforce dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| because I wholeheartedly believe that just because we close this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| these people that are throwing away tires from businesses and mattresses from hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| they're not going to start going to John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| They'll find another place to dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| So we really need teeth, and Commissioner Daly, I know you're working on the state with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4078)|
| 1:08:06| but I just want to make sure we know that we're headed down a slippery slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| when we start taking away the rights of the innocent because we can't handle the misdeeds of the bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| I will have a lot more information next week, but I hate to say this because I'm afraid that when I say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| that somebody's going to do this on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| The road's been closed for about five weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| We have zero dumping in five weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| And every question that's being asked here tonight has got an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| We've tried it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| We've hired a part-time deputy to patrol it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| We can't patrol it 24 hours a day, seven days a week, just like solid waste says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| I am tired of people coming into my community and dumping waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4134)|
| 1:09:03| I have got, you will see next week, I have got a picture of someone from 23 Zip Code, wherever 23 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4143)|
| 1:09:15| I have their picture where they come in there and dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| I'm tired of seeing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| I am with solid waste on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| The only way that this can be taken care of is to close that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| Do I wish it was any other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| But I'm looking at, I'll have the numbers correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| I am looking from where Browns Mountain, Twin Creek flows out of Browns Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| Browns Mountain, where the creek flows out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| a 10-year-old boy and girl should be able to get in that creek and play without worrying about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| There's 47 property owners from Twin Creek to Stock Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| There's from Stock Creek to Little River, there's about 70 property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| From Little River to Fort Loudoun Lake, there's another 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| I'll have them just going by memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| Those property owners are affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| Mosquitoes travel three miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| West Nile, Zika, syphilis, all these others, three miles, over three miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4215)|
| 1:10:22| Am I mad that they come into my community and dump?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Absolutely I'm mad about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| I would love to catch them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| You can ask Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Drew knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| I turn them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Shake your head, Drew, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| I've turned them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| And we can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| And it's so disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| My vote next week is going to be for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| And I'm sorry that the residents there may be inconvenienced for that mile travel time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| But I'm looking at the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| I'm looking at the safety of a three-mile-plus radius that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| And the only way that I can see, we've tried it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| We've tried closing roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| We will put up new lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| We will put more patrols in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| We will fix the driveways for Mr. Perrin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| We will do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| But putting up another fence is not going to stop somebody from coming in there and cutting it and pushing it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| They're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| I am so mad that you come into my community and dump it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| And most of them are from out of county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| We've got to ride around a curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| We've got a landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| Block Excavating wants to come in and dump into my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| All sorts of materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| They've been fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| They come in and wrote a $5,000 check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| That's nothing to them, $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| I am so tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| I want it stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4315)|
| 1:12:03| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| Give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| Julian Harris, 5652 Washington Pike, here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| I took pictures two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| I own a video production company and I have a drone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| And I took aerial shots that I showed some of the commissioners that came out on the road to look at it a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4346)|
| 1:12:34| Some of you got to see the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Right above Twin Creek Road on Martin Mill Pike that looks back down on Twin Creek, they're dumping there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| It's just that you can't see it without having an aerial shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| And Commissioner Gill saw the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| Closing a road going down Twin Creek, they're already dumping above Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| And also, as other people in the community will tell you, they've walked the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| There's been more dumping since the road closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| And Commissioner Gill was the one that first pointed that out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| So they've been walking up the hill and dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| So if they're willing to walk up the hill to keep dumping, closing the road off is not going to be the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| I'm sorry, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| If you're willing to walk up a hill to keep dumping, then that's not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| And so people who commission daily that said that there hasn't been any dumping in five weeks, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| And you can ask the other people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| They'll tell you the dumping has continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| And like I said, they're dumping from the top side of Twin Creek Road from Martin Mill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| And so are you going to close Martin Mill Pike, too, and stop the dumping from the top side of the hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| That's not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| I'm not for dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| I think the fines need to be raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| They need to be raised high enough to where someone doesn't want to dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| They think second about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| But closing the road and taking civil liberties away from the community is not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| And when you start doing that, the next time you say, well, it's no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| We'll just take that away and take it away the next time and the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4444)|

| 1:14:12| from doing something wrong, that's when our country starts going downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4452)|
| 1:14:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Mr. Stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| While he's coming up, can you, before we vote or before or after we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| make sure the public is aware that Monday is the real vote that matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4472)|
| 1:14:39| The motion that's before us is to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| But this has to be, this can't be on consent, can it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| They can still be pulled off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| I just want people to realize this may not be the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| To clear that up, I'll amend my motion for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| Is the second agreed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| Jim, is there any way that, what do you all plan to do with the section of road in between the close points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4504)|
| 1:15:12| Typically we, what's called scarify, essentially just remove the asphalt and plant it back in grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4512)|
| 1:15:21| And to address Julian's concerns, that section of guardrail that I was referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| because that's our concern as well, we don't want someone to continue to dump from the top side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| We're going to extend that guardrail around to where someone would have to physically stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| in Martin Mill Pike through traffic and dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| We're going to take away the option for them to get off the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| So we have thought of that and are going to try to address that through the installation of guardrail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| There was about 10, 15 foot there that they could back up and dump at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| and you're going to take that guardrail out to the shoulder of Martin Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| They would have to stop in through traffic of Martin Mill Pike to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| It won't provide any hazard to anybody driving to Martin Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| We would set the guardrail back just like it would be on any shoulder of the roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| so there wouldn't be any safety concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Okay, so you're going to close off the road just past the driveway on the left coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| and then coming down from Martin Mill about 20 feet down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| 20, 30 feet down off Martin Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| No, we would, the guardrail would actually, you wouldn't be able to access that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| Because we want to eliminate just what Mr. Julian was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| We don't want people to be able to get into that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| and the safest possible way would be to just put guardrail up through that shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| Any kind of barrier put at the, I'll call it the church side at that point past that driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| any kind of barrier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Yes, we would build an earthen berm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| There's kind of a standard for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| It would be like a four foot high earthen berm with two to one side slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| to where, you know, like a four-wheel drive couldn't traverse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| I was just wondering if there was any way we could just save the road in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| and barricade it, maybe four or five years later we could open the road back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| after we broke everybody's habit of coming to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| And we don't have to scarify the pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| That's just something we traditionally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| That's something that the property owners that may want to obtain the property back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| request at times, but we could certainly leave the asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| if that was something that you all wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| Mr. Chairman, that's not the word he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| It's not what I associated with the county commission last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| That's not the section I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| I just want you all to know that commission hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| Come to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Come to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| The top of the hill that Drew here is talking about is not the section I'm talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| where they're continuing to dump back down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| If you drive on past Twin Creek Road going on out to Johnsonville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| there is a guardrail going all the way down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| And you can't see it driving the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| You won't see maybe four or five tires on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| But when you take an aerial shot and you look down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| you can see they're dumping on past Twin Creek Road on Martin Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| off the side of Martin Mill Pike back down on the Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| And that's what I was talking about, not the little berm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| that's at the top of Twin Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| They're driving on past that and dumping off the side of Martin Mill Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| on past Twin Creek Road going toward Johnsonville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| And that's what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| And that's why I said are you going to close Martin Mill Pike off of it too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| because when they stop dumping there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| they're just going to start dumping there because they're already dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| And there's aerial pictures of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| Commissioner Besser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| If, and let me ask this, as just regular dumping that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| the maximum we can do on a fine for dumping is what, $50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| If it goes to Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| If it goes to Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| But, however, if you had somebody dumping on private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| or trespassing on private property and doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| what could you do to them then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| That would be a private civil action by the landowner against whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| They'd have to prove, in fact, who did it, what the damages were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| and then they could take it to Chantry Court and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| So, Mr. Van DeVate, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| When you close that road off, do you have to still maintain it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| If the right-of-way is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| we'll divide the right-of-way evenly between the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| put it back on the tax rolls, and convey it back into private hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| And then that becomes private property, and we don't have to maintain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| but then they could take, the public can take more strenuous actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| against the people that are dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| The potential is there, but you have to be able to prove who did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| I mean, if they can't catch who's doing it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| it won't make much difference who owns it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| unless they actually catch who's doing it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| and they have the resources to prosecute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| But they could take it to a different court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| Okay, but if you put up a sign that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| private property, do not enter for the people that's on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4824)|
| 1:20:32| If you're talking about converting a road to a private drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| then it would be a multi-easement driveway, which would give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| it's almost like an invitee on a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| The public would still have the right to go across it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| to get to any access home on that driveway, as if they were invited in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| You'd still have the same traffic potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| It just would mean that the maintenance and ownership would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| That's about all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| Okay, we have any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| We have a motion before us to move on to regular meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| with no recommendation and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4883)|
| 1:21:31| Okay, I'm going to read the resolution that was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| It's approving a contract with Grass Works Landscaping, LLC, for mowing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| This is Resolution 701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=4902)|

| 1:24:16| Go ahead, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| Why don't we have a public meeting while I have it at 1 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| Why don't we have it at 5 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5063)|

| 1:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| You know, I agree with Brad that having it in the middle of the day is not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| I was trying to find a time that's scheduled to where these things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5091)|

| 1:25:00| but if we're going to have a public hearing and have it at 1 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5100)|

| 1:27:01| in case we got any input from the public that we wanted to give feedback to on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5221)|

| 1:28:15| Is that enough time for you all to look at the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| The 17th would work for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5297)|

| 1:30:29| Do we have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| No, we're not done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| 2 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5432)|

| 1:30:34| We've got two more items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| The internet sales tax and 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| Okay, we've got those dates and we can come back Monday, next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| and talk about them, make sure they're, confirm them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| Say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Everybody got those dates and we can come back next Monday and try to confirm them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Item number 54 is a discussion item regarding the Tennessee County Services Association 2018 County Government Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5458)|
| 1:31:06| Mr. Chairman, since Commissioner Carringer is not here, can we just defer that until Monday then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| Discussion regarding the internet sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| Picking back up where you left off on finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| I found this kind of fascinating, and, of course, most of you know that when you research a bill that's going through Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5487)|
| 1:31:36| usually the title that's on the legislative website is not actually what the real bill is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5496)|
| 1:31:46| And this is actually House Bill 0971,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5506)|
| 1:31:54| and it's the way they calculate the state shared sales tax for out-of-state vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5514)|
| 1:32:05| And 25 years ago, when the Department of Revenue came up with a formula of how to address out-of-state vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5525)|
| 1:32:13| and assigning those dollars back to the local jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| they had a policy that if in a county, if there's cities, that basically the way the formula worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5539)|
| 1:32:30| that 92% of the money from this sales tax went back to the brick-and-mortar stores that were located within the municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5550)|
| 1:32:42| Well, the problem with that today, now that number is $300 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| Well, if you look at the people that are sending money to or having to pay sales tax on internet sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5568)|
| 1:32:58| you know, when you look at Knox County's got a population based in 2010 of about 430,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| and the city at 178,000, and the town of Farragut about 20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5584)|
| 1:33:11| that sales tax is getting allocated back to the city of Knoxville, basically about 92% of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5591)|
| 1:33:20| when they only are about 41% of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5600)|
| 1:33:27| So the problem is that folks who live in Commissioner Daley's district or Commissioner Wright's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5607)|
| 1:33:36| that are predominantly in the county, if you buy something online, the sales tax revenue goes back to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5616)|
| 1:33:44| as opposed to the county where you reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| So the problem has been the Department of Revenue cannot ask the vendor that's submitting the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5628)|
| 1:33:56| to say give us Carson Daley's address so that we can say, oh, that money should go to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| because he lives in the county or Bud Armstrong's address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| So they've been using this archaic formula for 25 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| Well, of course, now that the Department of Revenue and some of the legislators want to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| to an actual basis of why the counties are getting shortchanged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| obviously who do you think is the number one complaining about not changing the current law as it is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| Obviously it's the cities because they would be losing a big portion of that revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| And of course you already know that 50% of that $300 million is already going to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| But the point is the legislature has got to figure out something with now people paying internet sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5680)|
| 1:34:49| that if you live in the county, the county should be receiving those tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| as opposed to going to, in our case, the town of Farragut or the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5695)|
| 1:35:02| Do you kind of understand what's going on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| But I think in our case, like Knox County, most of the brick-and-mortar stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| a lot of those were annexed when you look at Turkey Creek or Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| But to say that people buying things on internet, that those dollars then should go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| to the brick-and-mortar store locations, it doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| So there's several representatives and senators that are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| wait a minute, that's not fair to the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| And the County Mayors Association had a special meeting last August and then again last October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5734)|
| 1:35:43| or actually November I should say, to discuss this with the county mayors to get their positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| as part of the Tennessee County Services Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| I'm fortunate that we didn't have any representation at either of those conferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| from Knox County from the County Mayors Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| So anyways, the thing is we're losing money and I don't know how this is going to end up being rectified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5759)|
| 1:36:08| It may roll over until next year, but it's something that needs to be on our radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5768)|
| 1:36:15| Because $300 million divided up by 95 counties is still a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| Doesn't this apply to the voluntary where businesses outside the state can volunteer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| This is the outside, yes, but remember the agreement with Tennessee with Amazon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| they have to collect sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| But $300 million is what's currently coming into the state from out of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| and it needs to be appropriated correctly to whatever entity deserves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5800)|
| 1:36:47| I think a lot of the reason why the formula works like that is if you look at Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| and Chris, maybe you can answer this if I'm too far off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| the city does generate three-fourths of the sales tax in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| because they do have those registers annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| Originally I think this came from catalog sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5824)|
| 1:37:11| 25 years ago that's exactly where it came from, but now the landscape has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5831)|
| 1:37:18| But you can't say that the 200,000 plus people that live in the county are not buying stuff online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5838)|
| 1:37:26| Because they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| And so if that money now is being allocated to the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| when it should be going to Knox County, we should be concerned about that, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5853)|
| 1:37:40| So anyways, it's going through the finance ways and means committees this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5860)|
| 1:37:48| I think Wednesday is the next session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| The cities are not happy because they're not anxious to give up any revenue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| That's a first step in the right direction, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| You know how I am with the internet sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5881)|
| 1:38:23| We are now to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| Is Lance McCold here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5908)|
| 1:38:39| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| If you could, please come down and give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| Very good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Lance McCold, 130 Cogdell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| Thank you for taking the time to hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| Last Monday we saw hundreds of people at the school board meeting urging the board to preserve two highly regarded programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5934)|
| 1:39:04| You couldn't make a bigger mistake than to think that this was some special interest group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| or that the pain in the school budget is limited to just two programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5950)|
| 1:39:18| Our teachers are underpaid and are being poached by surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| The budget has no increase in pay for the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| We have a couple new schools, but most of our schools are 40 plus years old and many of them need refurbishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5969)|
| 1:39:37| Our class sizes for our students are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| Our population grew about 6% between 2010 and 2016, but the budget constraints drove teacher numbers down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5980)|
| 1:39:49| I could go on, but it's clear we aren't funding our schools adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| If you said that the state government wasn't doing its share, you'd be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| We have to take some of the blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| In the past eight years, the state's contribution to Knox County Schools has increased from 34% to 40% of the total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6004)|
| 1:40:11| while our county's contribution has declined from 54% to 49%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6011)|
| 1:40:17| That's right, as the state's increased its funding, Knox County has carried a smaller fraction of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6017)|
| 1:40:27| Actually, the total funding hasn't increased very much at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| Now, yes, it's true that Knox County's budget has shown increased funding for our schools almost every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6032)|
| 1:40:39| but the plain fact is that the increases have not kept up with either the enrollment or with costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| If you divide Knox County's contribution to schools by the number of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| our contribution has actually gone down between 2009-10 year and 2016-17 school years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6050)|
| 1:40:59| To make matters worse, the cost of everything has increased about 15% in those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| So, despite the apparent annual increases in funding, in inflation-adjusted dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6064)|
| 1:41:13| we are spending about 15% less per student on our schools than we did in 2009-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6073)|
| 1:41:24| Now, candidates like to say they're going to keep taxes low by finding efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6084)|
| 1:41:30| Well, there's always some kind of small inefficiency that can be fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| but Knox County Schools has long ago eliminated any fad in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| For most of the past eight years, the system has been cutting flesh, even amputating good programs to balance the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6100)|
| 1:41:49| Our children have been and continue to be the losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| If you value our community and our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| I urge you to tell the school board to bring you a budget that actually meets the needs of the schools and their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6117)|
| 1:42:06| and then figure out how to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| Thank you for being patient and waiting until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Thank you, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6132)|

| 1:42:25| Carson, go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6145)|

| 1:44:09| I thought there were 15 violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| We split them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| We split them because we didn't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| We had 16 violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| Yeah, we had 15, 16 violations, and that was way too many to try to do them once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| so we split them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180416b?start=6264)|
