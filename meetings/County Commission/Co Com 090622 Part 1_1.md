| 2:35:23| and this in no way reflects upon Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9323)|
| 2:35:27| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9327)|
| 2:35:28| And let me say that if there are, like, particular issues, Commissioner, that have been presented to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9328)|
| 2:35:39| and you would like to perhaps meet with myself and Mr. Mason or principals of his firm and discuss those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9339)|
| 2:35:47| I think they would be amenable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| I don't think that they could agree to submit to a public meeting because they are involved in a, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9348)|
| 2:35:57| a formal complaint before the Board of Professional Responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9357)|
| 2:36:00| That would be a shame because it's not just myself who has questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9360)|
| 2:36:03| and actually I did receive a phone call last week from one of the partners at Kennerly-Montgomery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:08| and Finley, and I did have some questions, and they were answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| and I would say not necessarily to my satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9372)|
| 2:36:16| These are not just questions that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| These are questions that the residents of Knox County have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| and these questions need to be asked and answered as a matter of public record for the residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9380)|
| 2:36:28| Well, were the Board to go into some type of public investigation or interrogation like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9388)|
| 2:36:38| I would submit it shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| I don't believe I said interrogation, Mr. Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| That was not my intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| That was my word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9404)|
| 2:36:46| Then I would submit that it shouldn't take place in the context of an RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9406)|
| 2:36:52| Those are completely different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| But if, you know, if the commission elected to conduct some type of hearing into the propriety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9414)|
| 2:37:05| the potential conflicts, potential appearance in propriety, then the commission could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9425)|
| 2:37:13| Then the commission could do that, but it wouldn't be an RFQ process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9433)|
| 2:37:21| That's very, very different from what I think you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9441)|
| 2:37:25| I do have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| Ivan, you were asking me before the meeting, and I wasn't quite sure how to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9447)|
| 2:37:34| Ultimately, who funds the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| The employer and the employee funds the operations of the pension board along with interest earnings on investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9459)|
| 2:37:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| So it's not taxpayer money, then, that funds the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| Well, it's all taxpayer money, but it's not deposited as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9470)|
| 2:37:55| It is earnings of employees and the employer's share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| All of it ultimately is paid by taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| But it is, it comes out of the employee's checks, and the employer pays the employer's share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9483)|
| 2:38:10| Is that what you needed to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9493)|
| 2:38:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| Were there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9497)|
| 2:38:18| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9498)|
| 2:38:19| I just see if our law director could inform us of what the responsibility of Knox County Commission has with the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9499)|
| 2:38:27| What authority does the commission have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| Mr. Chairman, members of the board, in terms of your questions, in terms of the responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:38| obviously you're the keeper of the public coffers and the guardians of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| So you have a direct professional interest to ensure those monies are not being squandered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| In terms of your power and authority, the Knox County Charter reads that the pension board is empowered to hire its own counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9526)|
| 2:38:53| So while you can't compel them to change counsel, you can make requests, but those requests need not be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9533)|
| 2:39:00| Now, if you do feel, in fact, that there is something amiss, that there is an impropriety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9540)|
| 2:39:07| then you're empowered to seek an audit and to evaluate those of the processes of internal auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9547)|
| 2:39:15| But beyond that, you can't compel them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9555)|
| 2:39:18| I think what the distinction we have to draw as well, the term request for qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9558)|
| 2:39:26| under Tennessee law, you're not permitted by law to do requests for proposal or bids for professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9566)|
| 2:39:33| And under those professional services, attorneys are specifically enumerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| So the notion of request for qualifications is to make sure you have the best and the brightest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9577)|
| 2:39:42| rather than the lowest responsible bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| But since this board, because of the charter language, is delegated the authority to hire its own counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9585)|
| 2:39:51| you can't compel them to go out for RFQs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| Again, there's a distinction between what you can ask for and what you can compel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| And in this case, you can merely make inquiries or requests that need not be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9598)|
| 2:40:04| I'd like to let everybody know these pension board meetings are open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| You know, we meet on Sunday of commission at 10 o'clock in room 6 in the commission office upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9608)|
| 2:40:16| So you're welcome to come to the meetings at 10 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| Commissioner Schaff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| But I first wanted to respond to what's something Commissioner Burrell's, I guess, a question she had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| It was answered that, yes, it is taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| Ideally, it's taxpayer dollars, but only as they're paid as wages, you know, into the pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| If you recall, during the budget hearings, we put many millions, I think four actually into the UOP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9640)|
| 2:40:46| and a couple more into the other pension funds this year because of the bad performance of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9646)|
| 2:40:51| The market stank down 30 percent, et cetera, and to keep them actuarially sound, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9651)|
| 2:40:58| the general fund contributed about six million to the pension fund this year, to the multiple pension funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9658)|
| 2:41:05| But my question was to the law director, out of an abundance of caution, do you feel it's all right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9665)|
| 2:41:14| for members of the pension board to vote on this issue before us that we're speaking to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| There are four members of this 19-member body, including myself, on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| Is it all right that we're going to vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9683)|
| 2:41:28| You have, obviously, this resolution that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| Was this actually passed today by the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| And because it's public record, was it unanimous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| Well, clearly, if you're going to be asked to vote on something that's antagonistic to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| it's not really a state of potential conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| However, you are a separate board, and it would probably be wise at this juncture to abstain from voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9711)|
| 2:41:58| not because it's a per se violation, but, again, you now have a resolution that's contrary to that which you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9718)|
| 2:42:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9729)|
| 2:42:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| Commissioner Ivan Harmon, was there any discussion at all about this law firm not doing what it was supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:25| I mean, any discussions or any voting or anything that this was not a good firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9745)|
| 2:42:31| that Mr. Mason was not representing you properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9751)|
| 2:42:34| I wasn't at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9754)|
| 2:42:35| That's why I'm trying to get a feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9755)|
| 2:42:36| If this was unanimous, my sense is they have confidence in this firm and Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| I think with those people that know Mr. Mason is a well-respected attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| and he probably was the cause of this whole situation coming out over our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| and I think he's represented the pension board excellent in his firm also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| No one questioned his ability to represent the pension board, and I think everybody felt like he was doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9775)|
| 2:43:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9781)|
| 2:43:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| I just have a quick question, just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| Mr. Beeler says he's general counsel for the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9790)|
| 2:43:13| Mr. Mason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9796)|
| 2:43:17| He doesn't have a title as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| We refer to him as special counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| What Bill handles and has always focused his practice in is the area of plan document, preparation, amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9801)|
| 2:43:30| tax code that applies to public and private pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9810)|
| 2:43:34| He does both ERISA and non-ERISA work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| But particularly the plan document, for example, right now, you know, the board is being audited by the IRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9817)|
| 2:43:46| like a lot of other pension boards are, and Bill deals with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9826)|
| 2:43:51| He did the draft, almost all the draft preparation work on the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| So that's the type of work Bill does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| So we need two attorneys on the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| Well, we do different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:05| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:06| We've always had general counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| I've been their general counsel for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| And I handle day-to-day, all the other types of problems, issues that come up, everything else other than what Bill does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9851)|
| 2:44:19| I handle litigation for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| Bill does not do any litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9861)|
| 2:44:24| That was just really my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9864)|
| 2:44:25| I want to know why we had two attorneys on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| I just couldn't figure that one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9872)|
| 2:44:34| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| It seems to me like that we would be kind of overstepping our bounds here and trying to tell the pension board what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9876)|
| 2:44:45| from what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| On this whole issue, I think we have to be very careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| At our special meeting, we passed about as strong a resolution as we could pass at this time regarding the Lockett situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9891)|
| 2:45:02| Anything else that we do could jeopardize any kind of lawsuit that might be coming forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9902)|
| 2:45:08| So there comes a time when you need to pull in your horns and kind of wait and see what's happening before you make another decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9908)|
| 2:45:15| So I think we're just shooting in the wind here, spending time we don't need to be spending on something we can't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9915)|
| 2:45:22| about at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9922)|
| 2:45:26| Well, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| And I think by our counsel, the four people on the pension board need to accuse themselves, which is Commissioner Shouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9935)|
| 2:45:45| Commissioner Harmon, myself, and Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9945)|
| 2:45:51| I think we have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9951)|
| 2:45:52| Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| Well, just a clarification, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| If we vote for this, then we would be asking for this to be put out for request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9957)|
| 2:46:03| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| Commissioner Burroughs, do you want to state exactly what your intent of this is or put it out for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9965)|
| 2:46:11| Again, I am not in any way suggesting that Mr. Mason has not done an excellent job for the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9971)|
| 2:46:17| I'm not suggesting that he be fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| And I'm not demanding that we tell the pension board what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| It is simply a request that they send out a request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9985)|
| 2:46:30| I don't think this is in any way overstepping our bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9990)|
| 2:46:35| It's not telling them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| It's simply a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=9997)|
| 2:46:40| And in addition to the situation that we're in right now, it just makes sense to do this from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10000)|
| 2:46:46| And I don't believe that it has been done any time recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10010)|
| 2:46:54| No, it's my understanding that current counsel has been in place for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10014)|
| 2:46:59| And as far as the request, yes, it's precisely that, merely a request, not a demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10019)|
| 2:47:05| And it would have no force in law if it were a demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10025)|
| 2:47:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| Certainly, I respect our right to make this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10032)|
| 2:47:17| Respectfully, I'm going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10037)|
| 2:47:22| Mr. Bill Mason is known as one of the best ERISA and retirement plan attorneys in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10042)|
| 2:47:30| I think it's unfortunate the timing that he joined Kennerly, Montgomery, and Finley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10050)|
| 2:47:37| but he is, in my mind, in no way connected to anything that has happened within that firm and regarding Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10057)|
| 2:47:49| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=10069)|

| 3:05:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11110)|
| 3:05:11| Before we go to 914, to the people in the audience and also the people at home, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11111)|
| 3:05:23| in front of me is the trophy between four entities in Knox County, school board, city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11123)|
| 3:05:34| council, Metropolitan Planning Commission, and the County Commission had a softball tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11134)|
| 3:05:40| Of course, the winners were County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:47| So, you're saying I served this body well by staying out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11147)|
| 3:05:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11156)|
| 3:05:57| You were there in heart, so a full report is on the commission forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11157)|
| 3:06:03| I wanted us to win, that's why I didn't have anything to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11163)|
| 3:06:08| And we also have a special presentation that we're going to have, are you going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11168)|
| 3:06:16| We have a very special presentation for the MVP player of Knox County Commission, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11176)|
| 3:06:25| there were a lot of us, I was most impressed with our County Commission when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11185)|
| 3:06:31| our athletic skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11191)|
| 3:06:34| So whatever they may say about us as County Commissioners, they cannot talk bad about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11194)|
| 3:06:38| our athletic skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11198)|
| 3:06:40| But at this time, we didn't want to recognize one of our very special players, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11200)|
| 3:06:45| would be our commissioner in the 9th District, Mr. Mike Brown, as our MVP player of County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11205)|
| 3:06:54| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11214)|
| 3:06:55| Are we going to go out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11215)|
| 3:06:56| We will if you want to, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11216)|
| 3:06:57| Good thing it's sunshine today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11217)|
| 3:06:58| That's the most fun I've had on a ball field in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11218)|
| 3:07:12| Yeah, we want everybody to sign it, so we'll be passing it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11232)|
| 3:07:25| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to say something about the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| I would like to say give thanks to Ms. Broyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| She's been kind of the social chairman and an impetus for doing things that probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11250)|
| 3:07:39| aren't good for the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11259)|
| 3:07:42| We obviously, given our near recent past history, we don't do things that are fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11262)|
| 3:07:50| Everything we do is not fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| And so I'd just like to thank Ms. Broyle for continuing to prod us to do some things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11272)|
| 3:07:59| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11279)|
| 3:08:00| Thank you, Ms. Broyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11280)|
| 3:08:01| Commissioner Norman, I just want to update you that we are taking the winner on of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11281)|
| 3:08:07| Rocky Top League after their championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11287)|
| 3:08:09| It's our next endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11289)|
| 3:08:11| They'll get back to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11291)|
| 3:08:17| 914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11297)|
| 3:08:19| 914 is on page 16 or 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11299)|
| 3:08:27| It is a resolution making certain finding of facts regarding the conduct of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11307)|
| 3:08:33| Law Director, William S. Lockett, expressing the Commission's conclusions regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11313)|
| 3:08:37| consequences thereof with respect to the eligibility of William S. Lockett to hold the office of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11317)|
| 3:08:43| Knox County Law Director in the operation of the Law Director's Office and undertaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11323)|
| 3:08:48| the responsibility to transmit said findings and conclusions to appropriate authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11328)|
| 3:08:53| for the initiation of all appropriate and necessary legal proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11333)|
| 3:08:57| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11337)|
| 3:08:58| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11338)|
| 3:09:01| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11341)|
| 3:09:03| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11343)|
| 3:09:04| 6-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11344)|
| 3:09:05| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11345)|
| 3:09:06| Mr. Chairman, I'm way down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11346)|
| 3:09:10| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11350)|
| 3:09:11| Way down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11353)|
| 3:09:14| Do you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11354)|
| 3:09:17| No, the motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| I'm for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| No, we don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11362)|
| 3:09:25| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11365)|
| 3:09:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11366)|
| 3:09:27| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11367)|
| 3:09:28| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11368)|
| 3:09:30| I find it interesting that I stand before you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11370)|
| 3:09:35| I've only stood before Commission a couple other times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| Once I asked you to seat me as a Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11378)|
| 3:09:43| The second time I stood before Commission, this could be a quiz, but I'm sure some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11383)|
| 3:09:48| you will remember, I gave the devotional address and said that in certain situations we sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11388)|
| 3:09:55| have to cross the road to deal with difficult situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11395)|
| 3:10:01| Today, we're dealing with what I view to be the most difficult situation that could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11401)|
| 3:10:07| come before Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| I cannot speak for Commissioner McKenzie or Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11409)|
| 3:10:14| I can only speak for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11414)|
| 3:10:17| But we three, as the oldest of new Commission, and then those that have been added since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11417)|
| 3:10:26| now totaling 10 people sitting on Commission as being new, I would represent that we face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11426)|
| 3:10:36| a real dilemma here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11436)|
| 3:10:41| At the time that I was standing, along with the other new Commissioners, seeking to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11441)|
| 3:10:47| elected to the office of Knox County Commission, we stood and faced lots of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11447)|
| 3:10:56| We faced lots of questions about our background, because I've never been in politics before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11456)|
| 3:11:04| We faced a lot of questions about how we would deal with certain specific situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11464)|
| 3:11:11| And I think the only thing I could come back to was that here's my, and I'll give how old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11471)|
| 3:11:17| I am, and this is how I've dealt with things through my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11477)|
| 3:11:23| You can take those life experiences of mine, and you can weigh and measure how you'll think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11483)|
| 3:11:30| I might react being seated on County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11490)|
| 3:11:36| This resolution that's before us is not about church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11496)|
| 3:11:39| It's not about political affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| It's not about family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11501)|
| 3:11:45| And as something was brought up a few minutes ago, this is not a resolution about criminal act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11505)|
| 3:11:52| This is a resolution about our ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11512)|
| 3:12:00| It's about Commission being the representative body, which we, I feel, is charged to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11520)|
| 3:12:06| to develop policy and set the tone for leadership in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11526)|
| 3:12:13| This resolution was presented and has been in full view of County Commission since June 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11533)|
| 3:12:19| I think it stood the test of time in an environment of ever-increasing negative information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11539)|
| 3:12:30| Now, we've heard the reports of committees, and I got a little confused there about it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11550)|
| 3:12:36| now moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11556)|
| 3:12:39| I've also asked that anyone that would agree with me to be co-signators of this petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11559)|
| 3:12:50| and asked that if anyone else would join Commissioners Carringer, Saunders, Hammond, Mark Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11570)|
| 3:12:58| and myself in offering this resolution to County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11578)|
| 3:13:05| And I have to ask for a show of hands because I would ask that Madam Secretary, Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11585)|
| 3:13:13| record those if there are any others than those five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11593)|
| 3:13:19| I see Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11599)|
| 3:13:22| I see Ed Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11602)|
| 3:13:28| This is a defining moment of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| And I asked, I think nothing more than you stand for the condemnation of the ethics of the person that stood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11611)|
| 3:13:41| when I stood on the stump and asked to be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11621)|
| 3:13:46| Is it only going to be seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11626)|
| 3:13:50| Could I, I guess, ask a question since you're making this plea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11630)|
| 3:13:56| I agree with you wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11636)|
| 3:14:00| The one piece of it, and I don't have it right in front of me, but there was one piece of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11640)|
| 3:14:08| that I thought didn't sit well or was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11648)|
| 3:14:16| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11656)|
| 3:14:18| Let us go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11658)|
| 3:14:21| I don't know if you can scroll down to the page in the workup for today's meeting or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11661)|
| 3:14:27| There are six whereases in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11667)|
| 3:14:35| The first one being that we recognize that the law director is elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11675)|
| 3:14:41| It's about four lines, but that's what the first whereas does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11681)|
| 3:14:48| Oh, this would be a good place for that little red dot pointer, wouldn't it, Charlie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11688)|
| 3:14:51| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11691)|
| 3:14:55| The second whereas states that we have lost trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11695)|
| 3:15:03| The third whereas relates that by admission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11703)|
| 3:15:14| the current law director has stated that there is a breach of his contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11714)|
| 3:15:20| The fourth whereas, maybe I said something to this a moment ago that has stood the test of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11720)|
| 3:15:27| and that there's been no denying of the facts that are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11727)|
| 3:15:42| The fifth whereas would, to me and to those people that are co-signing with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11742)|
| 3:15:50| leave commission with no reasonable inference that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11750)|
| 3:15:56| other than that Mr. Lockett might never have disclosed these facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11756)|
| 3:16:02| except he was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11762)|
| 3:16:08| The dark word here would be blackmailed into it in front of an open meeting in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11768)|
| 3:16:13| These facts should have come out while he was campaigning, is my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11773)|
| 3:16:19| And the sixth whereas, there is an unavoidable conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11779)|
| 3:16:26| that he did not adhere to the highest standards of honesty, fidelity, and professionalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11786)|
| 3:16:35| So if he didn't meet our high standards here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11795)|
| 3:16:40| if he campaigned, these are sections one and section two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11800)|
| 3:16:44| if he campaigned for election knowing falsehoods were being pressed upon us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11804)|
| 3:16:57| section three, if he violated things that are in the ethics part of rule eight of the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11817)|
| 3:17:08| of the state of Tennessee as governing professional conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11828)|
| 3:17:14| then it would appear that he's violated the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11834)|
| 3:17:20| In other words, the professional conduct of an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11840)|
| 3:17:25| Section four being that he has eroded the trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11845)|
| 3:17:28| He has at least eroded my trust and confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11848)|
| 3:17:31| enough for me to stand up and say this is the most important thing I've said to Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11851)|
| 3:17:37| to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11857)|
| 3:17:41| We get into some conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| These conclusions have already almost been implemented in other actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11864)|
| 3:17:49| that we ask for his resignation in five days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11869)|
| 3:17:52| and if he doesn't, that the chairman of commission be authorized and directed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11872)|
| 3:18:00| and there may be something in there that you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11880)|
| 3:18:02| Yeah, that's the statement that I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11882)|
| 3:18:04| I think we have other pieces of resolutions on tonight's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11884)|
| 3:18:12| speaking to some of these things in part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11892)|
| 3:18:15| The thing that I think we've missed is the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11895)|
| 3:18:19| with every swirling piece of new information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11899)|
| 3:18:23| we have to get back together and talk about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11903)|
| 3:18:28| I don't think there's any need to talk about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| I think that Chairman Strickland can, if he needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11911)|
| 3:18:35| if he in his best judgment sees that we need legal representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11915)|
| 3:18:40| to present the best case possible to whoever it needs to be presented to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11920)|
| 3:18:46| and there are lots of people named in here that we can present to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11926)|
| 3:18:53| I guess the statement that got me was directed to employ another attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11933)|
| 3:18:58| I mean, we can authorize him, but to direct him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11938)|
| 3:19:01| that's the only heartburn I have with this entire document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11941)|
| 3:19:09| Sounds like we're compelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11949)|
| 3:19:13| I would almost, to get your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11953)|
| 3:19:18| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11958)|
| 3:19:19| Drop the word directed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11959)|
| 3:19:23| but I think it's covered a little bit closer in the tail end of the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11963)|
| 3:19:29| saying that he needs to know that it's something that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11969)|
| 3:19:35| He can be authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11975)|
| 3:19:38| Requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11978)|
| 3:19:39| We can drop the word and direct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11979)|
| 3:19:42| We can drop the word and direct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| My hand goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11986)|
| 3:19:49| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11989)|
| 3:19:50| There's only one other thing here that I wanted to make a point about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11990)|
| 3:19:53| As we tussled with this the other night, it almost appeared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11993)|
| 3:19:58| and I say this really out of respect to the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=11998)|
| 3:20:02| this is really the reason I'm standing here saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| is because all the things that we did the other night are in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12006)|
| 3:20:11| or are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12011)|
| 3:20:13| All that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12013)|
| 3:20:16| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12016)|
| 3:20:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12020)|
| 3:20:21| No, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12021)|
| 3:20:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12022)|
| 3:20:23| I completely disagree with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12023)|
| 3:20:25| We have not told, we have not asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12025)|
| 3:20:28| we have not directed the chairman of commission to go do anything on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12028)|
| 3:20:36| What did we vote at the special meeting then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| To do some specific tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12038)|
| 3:20:40| I've offered to you that we are offering here any and all tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12040)|
| 3:20:47| Any and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12047)|
| 3:20:48| But you're implying that because we didn't hold up our hand or sign on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12048)|
| 3:20:52| that we're not agreeing with what you have in your proposal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12052)|
| 3:20:56| But my contention is that at that special meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12056)|
| 3:21:00| we did everything we could do that night without jeopardizing any kind of lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12060)|
| 3:21:07| that might come down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12067)|
| 3:21:08| That's exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12068)|
| 3:21:09| We've featured him, we've asked him to resign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| we asked that a letter be sent to the attorney general to do the further investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12071)|
| 3:21:16| we've asked him to step down as our representative here at the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12076)|
| 3:21:21| and I don't know that we can do anything further right now legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12081)|
| 3:21:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12084)|
| 3:21:25| We wanted to make sure we did not jeopardize a criminal action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12085)|
| 3:21:31| and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12091)|
| 3:21:32| I'm not asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| I'm asking for anything and all things possible to be done as relates to the ethics violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12094)|
| 3:21:41| that I view have been committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| But I think we did that on that special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12103)|
| 3:21:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12105)|
| 3:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12106)|
| 3:21:49| I'm asking commission to take a stand on ethics to do whatever possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12109)|
| 3:21:56| avoiding, if at all possible, jeopardizing the criminal case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12116)|
| 3:22:01| Now, if the district attorney cannot insure or significantly defend his criminal case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12121)|
| 3:22:12| I'm not going to call for a poll of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12132)|
| 3:22:15| but I think that in all the people that I talk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12135)|
| 3:22:18| citizens of Knox County who have expressed their opinion to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| everywhere in Knox County and Sevier County, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12141)|
| 3:22:27| the most important thing right now facing us is that the law director that we currently employ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12147)|
| 3:22:34| not be the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12154)|
| 3:22:37| that we not wait 12 months or 14 months for a recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12157)|
| 3:22:44| that we take whatever act is appropriate now to get this thing moving on the ethics point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12164)|
| 3:22:52| not on the criminal court, not on the criminal side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12172)|
| 3:22:55| The other night we did talk about the criminal complaints, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12175)|
| 3:22:58| I'm not even speaking to anything that I view being done wrong criminally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12178)|
| 3:23:03| This is only about the ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12183)|
| 3:23:05| But the ethics part is out of our hands, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12185)|
| 3:23:07| We don't have any jurisdiction over the attorney's ethics division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12187)|
| 3:23:12| We don't have any jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12192)|
| 3:23:13| We can ask them, which we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| We have no jurisdiction to tell them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12195)|
| 3:23:17| We have no jurisdiction over the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12197)|
| 3:23:20| We can only ask him what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12200)|
| 3:23:22| So I think we have done all we can do at this point, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12202)|
| 3:23:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12205)|
| 3:23:26| And that's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12206)|
| 3:23:27| That's the conscience part that you'll have to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| and I'm voting on my conscience part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| I'm voting the way I hear people in Knox County want it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12212)|
| 3:23:36| They want him out of office now, whatever it takes to be out of office now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12216)|
| 3:23:41| If that jeopardizes the criminal cases we didn't want to jeopardize the other day, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12221)|
| 3:23:47| If he is out of office, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12227)|
| 3:23:49| But there's nothing that this body can do to get him out of office right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12229)|
| 3:23:54| Legally, we cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12234)|
| 3:23:56| Oh, I recognize that in the first whereas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| But we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12239)|
| 3:24:00| Then why are we debating the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12240)|
| 3:24:01| We can ask the commissioner, the chairman of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| to do whatever act may be possible to expedite whatever is taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12245)|
| 3:24:11| We didn't do that the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| We just gave him a few specific acts to go do, and he did those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12253)|
| 3:24:17| And one of those acts came back saying it may jeopardize our criminal case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12257)|
| 3:24:22| My point exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12262)|
| 3:24:23| And I don't think it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12263)|
| 3:24:25| We can ask the law director if he thinks that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| But I don't think that's a part of what I'm here to say tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12267)|
| 3:24:31| I'm here to deliver to you, standing here in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| begging you to say it's okay that he be dismissed on ethical charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12273)|
| 3:24:38| We all have that feeling, but there's nothing we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| Okay, vote for this resolution, then, and we'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| Who's signing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12284)|
| 3:24:45| I'm putting it to you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| Who's signing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12287)|
| 3:24:50| Who can dismiss for ethical violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12292)|
| 3:24:53| I've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12293)|
| 3:24:54| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12294)|
| 3:24:55| When you're on the floor, you're going to be asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12295)|
| 3:24:59| Who can dismiss for ethical reasons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12302)|
| 3:25:04| Will you finish with your statement, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| I think that I have sufficient documentation on who may stand with me on this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12307)|
| 3:25:14| and I think that people's minds may be made up, and I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12314)|
| 3:25:23| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12323)|
| 3:25:24| We have several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12324)|
| 3:25:27| I assume people have their minds made up, and I would call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12327)|
| 3:25:32| I think this is the thing that bothers me most about what we're taking part in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12332)|
| 3:25:38| is that we, commission, can't get away from the fact that this has nothing to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12338)|
| 3:25:44| furthering the ongoing business of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12344)|
| 3:25:49| We've had a called meeting about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12349)|
| 3:25:52| We've known about it for more than a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12352)|
| 3:25:56| Do we have a second to the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12356)|
| 3:25:59| Do we have a second to the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12359)|
| 3:26:04| I think, Commissioner Wright, I think some people have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12364)|
| 3:26:09| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12369)|
| 3:26:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12370)|
| 3:26:14| Commissioner Wright, I appreciate the stance you've taken, and whether or not I'm a co-sponsor of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12374)|
| 3:26:20| or not has nothing to do with whether or not I'm going to vote for it or not vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12380)|
| 3:26:25| Does he have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12385)|
| 3:26:28| Commissioner Wright, right now I have the floor, as you kept saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12388)|
| 3:26:32| You continued to say you had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12392)|
| 3:26:35| Let's not get into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12395)|
| 3:26:36| And the Chairman has now recognized me as having the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12396)|
| 3:26:40| And he said to ask questions, and I'm waiting for your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12400)|
| 3:26:46| And my question is for the Law Director, is once you've read through this particular resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12406)|
| 3:27:00| does it add anything more than what we passed last week, or I guess the previous week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12420)|
| 3:27:07| I would like to see the Law Director out immediately, like Commissioner Wright does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12427)|
| 3:27:15| Does this help us remove him from office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12435)|
| 3:27:21| I believe the Board has been advised and is clearly aware that whatever legal steps you've taken have been taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12441)|
| 3:27:31| except for sending a letter to the State Attorney General or, in the alternative, a group of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12451)|
| 3:27:37| or citizens filing an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12457)|
| 3:27:39| But in terms of a body politic, you've complied with your ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12459)|
| 3:27:44| You've complied with the parameters established for you under Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12464)|
| 3:27:49| For instance, if you look at your ethics policy, as you recall, the State of Tennessee required counties across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12469)|
| 3:27:57| to enact ethics policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12477)|
| 3:27:59| You have an ethics committee that you refer initially ethics issues to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12479)|
| 3:28:04| The first order of redress is that you refer these matters to the county attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12484)|
| 3:28:08| Obviously, that's not applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| Number two, in the case of an official, refer the matter to the county legislative body for possible public censure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12490)|
| 3:28:15| of the legislative body, which you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12495)|
| 3:28:18| Three, in the case of an employee, not applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12498)|
| 3:28:20| And in the case involving possible violation of state statutes, refer the matter to the District Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12500)|
| 3:28:25| for possible ouster or criminal prosecution, which you've likewise done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12505)|
| 3:28:29| I can't comment intelligently as to whether or not an ouster suit would affect a criminal investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12509)|
| 3:28:35| albeit the prosecuting authority has intimated that it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12515)|
| 3:28:40| But that's their opinion, and, of course, you're not bound by that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12520)|
| 3:28:45| just understanding that he has opined that it could have an effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12525)|
| 3:28:49| But in terms of the legal avenues to you, they're limited, and I believe you've exercised them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12529)|
| 3:28:58| I'll vote for this resolution because I don't have a problem with repeating what I did two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12538)|
| 3:29:05| because I felt like what I voted on two weeks ago and what I believe a lot of other commissioners voted on was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12545)|
| 3:29:13| a lot of it's contained within this particular resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12553)|
| 3:29:17| I would like the law director to resign immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12557)|
| 3:29:20| That's what I was wanting to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12560)|
| 3:29:23| And I'll vote for this, but I'm not sure how much more it does other than asks for giving the direction to the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12563)|
| 3:29:35| to write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12575)|
| 3:29:37| Commissioner Wright, is there something that I'm missing that this particular resolution will do to help us get rid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12577)|
| 3:29:46| Bill Lockett as our law director that we did not pass at our special meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12586)|
| 3:29:52| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12592)|
| 3:29:53| What does this do on top of what we've already done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12593)|
| 3:29:59| In deference to the law director, I appreciate his comments and accept those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12599)|
| 3:30:07| I believe that the primary impact of what we did at our call meeting was to say we didn't want him to be our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12607)|
| 3:30:21| and we didn't want him sitting at the end of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12621)|
| 3:30:24| I believe there are other things that are added in here that more specifically turn our direction from criminal pursuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12624)|
| 3:30:35| to ethics violations pursuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12635)|
| 3:30:39| It's obvious that the code that was looked at, I'd have to ask Commissioner Armstrong if it was rule number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12639)|
| 3:30:50| and that's saying that we as a client break our attorney-client relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12650)|
| 3:31:00| We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12660)|
| 3:31:01| I don't think we said we wanted to pursue any and all activity to have him removed from office by ouster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12661)|
| 3:31:12| as the law director has mentioned, or using ethics violations as the primary mover as opposed to criminal complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12672)|
| 3:31:23| I thought the ouster suit was part of what we passed at the special meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12683)|
| 3:31:27| and that's why Chairman Strickland went to the DA asking General Nichols if an ouster procedure would be warranted at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12687)|
| 3:31:40| You know, Commissioner Wright, I'll be happy to vote for your resolution because I believe that however we get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12700)|
| 3:31:48| the end result is that the law director does need to step aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| And if this helps, then I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12712)|
| 3:31:59| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12719)|
| 3:32:02| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| I agree completely with what Commissioner Wright has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12724)|
| 3:32:08| and I think there is a little bit of a difference is that he, in this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12728)|
| 3:32:12| says that we will direct the chairman of the commission to essentially take all steps to remove him from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12732)|
| 3:32:22| He did make a request to the local county attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12742)|
| 3:32:25| but we have not made the step of either sending a letter to the governor or to the state attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12745)|
| 3:32:31| I think one of the things that this body needs to decide is do we want to try to do everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12751)|
| 3:32:37| which would entail an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12757)|
| 3:32:40| I respect people's opinions that say that let's not do that if it's going to interfere with Mr. Wells' criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12760)|
| 3:32:50| However, we represent the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12770)|
| 3:32:55| and I think that the nearly unanimous will of the citizens is to have him removed from office as quickly as possible for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12775)|
| 3:33:06| One is that his salary is $148,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12786)|
| 3:33:11| I think that's roughly $2,800 a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12791)|
| 3:33:14| And secondly, he's not functioning in the job that he's supposed to function as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12794)|
| 3:33:18| which is the counsel to the Knox County government and really the Knox County people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12798)|
| 3:33:26| The quickest way, if it was seen fit by the courts, to have him removed from office would be to file the ouster suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12806)|
| 3:33:34| and then within five days there could be an application made to the court that's hearing that to have him suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12814)|
| 3:33:41| And the way that I look at the Tennessee code, even though it doesn't address this directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12821)|
| 3:33:46| is that a suspension would stop him from being paid by the Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12826)|
| 3:33:52| And I'm basing that on the part of the code that deals with reinstatement because reinstatement says that during the period of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12832)|
| 3:33:59| suspension, if he is reinstated, he would receive back pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12839)|
| 3:34:07| I don't know if the law director is looking for that or not, but it's Tennessee code, it's 8-47-121,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12847)|
| 3:34:14| and it says the salary and fees of the officer's office during the time of the officer's suspension will be paid once he's reinstated to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12854)|
| 3:34:23| Yes, sir, that is a correct recitation of the law on the subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12863)|
| 3:34:26| and that is the one benefit of a civil ouster is that added ability to ask the court to suspend the person in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12866)|
| 3:34:34| And during that time, she or he would have to step down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12874)|
| 3:34:37| and void pay, salary, and benefits until such time there's a formal hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12877)|
| 3:34:42| So that is certainly a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12882)|
| 3:34:44| And likewise, you can also send a letter to Attorney General Cooper, who is the state attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12884)|
| 3:34:49| as well as asking him to conduct an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12889)|
| 3:34:52| But ten citizens can file an ouster suit, and you're likewise citizens, so you can likewise file an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12892)|
| 3:35:01| The only distinction is, of course, you don't know what a court is going to do in the ultimate decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12901)|
| 3:35:08| and there's always a risk that if it fails, he'll be reinstated and get back pay and attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12908)|
| 3:35:14| But that's just a measured decision the board has to make in terms of a cost-benefit analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12914)|
| 3:35:19| And again, I think that's part of what Commissioner Wright's resolution addresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12919)|
| 3:35:24| is that it's asking the chairman of the commission to go ahead and take all actions that are possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12924)|
| 3:35:32| and I think that action would include petitioning the state attorney general to file the ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12932)|
| 3:35:39| And I, incidentally, will support the resolution, and I would support that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12939)|
| 3:35:43| because I think that that's in the best interest of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12943)|
| 3:35:49| If I could, Mr. Chairman, one thing that is tenuous is under the rules of professional conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12949)|
| 3:35:56| a client can always discharge an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12956)|
| 3:35:58| Unfortunately, those rules never took into consideration an elected law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12958)|
| 3:36:02| and that's the quagmire you find yourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12962)|
| 3:36:05| Generally, in my 20 years of practice, if a client would ever come to me and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12965)|
| 3:36:10| I don't want you to handle my case, that's not a debatable issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12970)|
| 3:36:13| You walk, because you know, one, the client's unhappy, two, a grievance is going to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12973)|
| 3:36:18| You're hamstrung in this case by the very rules that are served to protect you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12978)|
| 3:36:22| because you have this inability, essentially, to discharge him because your charter works against you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12982)|
| 3:36:27| which, of course, requires a law director to do that, which he's paid to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12987)|
| 3:36:31| So, you know, the board clearly has, I believe, discussed every possible redress you could seek at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=12991)|
| 3:36:40| I don't think there's any stones unturned or any other, you know, magic, so to speak, remedies out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13000)|
| 3:36:46| You've pretty much covered everything exhaustively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13006)|
| 3:36:49| Let me add one more thing to that before I give up the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13009)|
| 3:36:52| And, you know, the question comes up, can he represent other parts of the government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13012)|
| 3:36:57| We've already said in the Ethics Committee he's not to represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13017)|
| 3:37:00| We've said the same thing here for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13020)|
| 3:37:03| But I would like to point out on the county charter, and it's in the second sentence of Section 3.08, paragraph D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13023)|
| 3:37:13| that the first sentence says that it's the law director's responsibility to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13033)|
| 3:37:19| and administer all the legal affairs of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13039)|
| 3:37:22| And then the next sentence says that no other elected or appointed officer shall employ an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13042)|
| 3:37:28| unless he or she is authorized and empowered to do so by resolution of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13048)|
| 3:37:34| That's just so you're looking there at Section 3.08, and it's the second sentence in paragraph D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13054)|
| 3:37:40| So if there are other parts of the Knox County government, including the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13060)|
| 3:37:46| or other committees that he sets on as legal counsel by resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13066)|
| 3:37:51| we could empower another attorney to sit in his place by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13071)|
| 3:37:56| That's something that we've not exercised up to this point, but that is another option that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13076)|
| 3:38:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13081)|
| 3:38:02| And the school board can essentially do the same thing in terms of seeking other counsel, if they so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13082)|
| 3:38:10| You're talking about seeking counsel for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13090)|
| 3:38:13| Well, for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13093)|
| 3:38:14| Any other committee that he would set on as counsel is that by resolution this commission can authorize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13094)|
| 3:38:22| and empower another attorney to sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13102)|
| 3:38:26| They can't do it themselves, but we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13106)|
| 3:38:31| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13113)|
| 3:38:34| Just a point of clarification, this does cover the item that I had submitted in Resolution 913 to ask the State Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13114)|
| 3:38:45| to investigate the Knox County Law Director and if cause is found to bring an ouster suit, and that is contained in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13125)|
| 3:38:53| One thing I did want to clarify, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13133)|
| 3:38:59| He's busy with the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13139)|
| 3:39:05| We have a question, Commissioner Wright, for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| One thing I did want to clarify, and I think I heard this when you were at the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13147)|
| 3:39:11| and directed to was removed for the benefit of my fellow commissioner from the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13151)|
| 3:39:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13162)|
| 3:39:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13163)|
| 3:39:28| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13168)|
| 3:39:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13170)|
| 3:39:31| I've tried to eat my Wheaties on this one, and so if you'll bear with me here for just a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13171)|
| 3:39:34| I've done quite a bit of research on this and would like to point out a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13174)|
| 3:39:39| I believe that our law director and his staff, they owe their allegiance to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13179)|
| 3:39:44| They do not represent any single board or commission or any individual office holder or employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13184)|
| 3:39:48| but they represent all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13188)|
| 3:39:51| As the charter states, as Commissioner Briggs has just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13191)|
| 3:39:54| our law director is legally responsible for all legal affairs of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13194)|
| 3:39:58| I think this is important, and I'll explain why in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13198)|
| 3:40:01| Only a charter amendment or his removal from office can change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13201)|
| 3:40:06| The fact that he is not physically here, the fact that we have asked him not to attend our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13206)|
| 3:40:10| does not mean that he is still not responsible for all legal affairs of Knox County at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13210)|
| 3:40:17| We've heard from the district attorney general who has said that he feels that it would perhaps interfere with his investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13217)|
| 3:40:24| His comments are understandable because he's concerned about a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13224)|
| 3:40:28| However, we are responsible for a nearly billion-dollar government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13228)|
| 3:40:34| in which we are to provide policy and leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13234)|
| 3:40:37| I don't believe nothing can be more important than for us to take a look at an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13237)|
| 3:40:41| who has self-admitted some possible wrongdoings, some possible standards of ethical conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13241)|
| 3:40:48| Do we say that the standard we will adhere to is we didn't hurt anybody, no one got hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13248)|
| 3:40:56| Is that the standard that we want to apply here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13256)|
| 3:41:00| The Knox County Commission, as you've heard before, speaks for all of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13260)|
| 3:41:04| We do that every day, whether we adopt legislation, whether we commend citizen achievements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13264)|
| 3:41:08| or whether we memorialize a movie star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13268)|
| 3:41:11| When Knox County acts, it is the position of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13271)|
| 3:41:15| We are the policymaking body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13275)|
| 3:41:18| Now, we know that there are a couple of things that we can do in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13278)|
| 3:41:21| First of all, we can provide for an ouster suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| which would provide for the prompt suspension of the officeholder from their office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13283)|
| 3:41:27| remove them from receiving compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13287)|
| 3:41:30| and we could get an expedited answer to the petition for removal as well as an expedited hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13290)|
| 3:41:34| It's interesting that we're talking about his salary, removing him from all of the boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13294)|
| 3:41:39| and not allowing him to be physically in the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| However, he is still legally responsible for all of the affairs of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13301)|
| 3:41:45| He will continue to draw his salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13305)|
| 3:41:49| I see no critical reason why we cannot proceed with an ouster suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13309)|
| 3:41:52| concurrent with the criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13312)|
| 3:41:54| There are different matters entirely, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13314)|
| 3:41:57| Different standards of proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13317)|
| 3:41:58| Ouster standard is less than the beyond reasonable doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| and I'll touch on that again in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| There are different remedies and penalties here, different objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13323)|
| 3:42:06| It would seem to me that an experienced attorney would be able to proceed with an ouster proceeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13326)|
| 3:42:10| without interfering with the criminal matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13330)|
| 3:42:13| and the ouster statutes provide for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13333)|
| 3:42:16| Calling on the state attorney general is a potential remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13336)|
| 3:42:18| If the attorney general declines to do what appears to be his duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13338)|
| 3:42:21| we could bring the action as very interested citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13341)|
| 3:42:25| To this day, Mr. Lockett has failed to direct this commission directly to offer any explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13345)|
| 3:42:32| He has failed to make even a formal disclosure to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13352)|
| 3:42:36| He has told everyone else at least some of the basics of the story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13356)|
| 3:42:40| except the representatives of his client, which is the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13360)|
| 3:42:44| The only disclosures we have have come through media reports and word of mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13364)|
| 3:42:48| and the disclosure that he made to the pension board, I believe, was incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13368)|
| 3:42:53| Now, it's been stated we have no authority to dismiss Mr. Lockett as our counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13373)|
| 3:42:57| as long as he is still in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13377)|
| 3:42:59| But as I said before, physically removing him from the commission chambers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13379)|
| 3:43:02| does not prevent him from conducting the legal affairs of Knox County, including this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13382)|
| 3:43:06| If he admits that he is not continuing to conduct the legal affairs of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13386)|
| 3:43:11| at that point he is subject to ouster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13391)|
| 3:43:14| So, Mr. Jarrett, I would ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13394)|
| 3:43:17| Is Mr. Lockett responsible for the legal affairs of Knox County at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13397)|
| 3:43:24| It accords with the strict language of the charter, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13404)|
| 3:43:29| We've heard some opinions that the Board of Responsibility, the Tennessee Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13409)|
| 3:43:36| rules are part of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| There are a lot of rules and regulations that attorneys must abide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13418)|
| 3:43:42| And so all of these can be and should be part of any decisions that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13422)|
| 3:43:47| And finally, Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point to state law on a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13427)|
| 3:43:51| First of all, 8-47-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13431)|
| 3:43:55| Every person holding any office of trust or profit who shall knowingly or willingly commit misconduct in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13435)|
| 3:44:03| knowingly or willingly neglect to perform any duty enjoined by any such officer of any laws of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13443)|
| 3:44:08| or who shall commit any act, and I'm paraphrasing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13448)|
| 3:44:10| constituting a violation of any penal statute involving moral turpitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13450)|
| 3:44:13| shall forfeit such office and shall be ousted from such office in the manner hereanafter provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13453)|
| 3:44:18| The fact that Mr. Lockett has not come before us, the fact that he has not given us the fact that he has loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13458)|
| 3:44:25| the fact that he has not told us that there are some potential problems here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13465)|
| 3:44:30| I believe that these things need to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13470)|
| 3:44:34| The Attorney General and the District Attorney Generals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13474)|
| 3:44:36| county attorneys, and city attorneys within their prospective jurisdictions may institute such actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13476)|
| 3:44:40| without complaint being made to them or request made of them as they are authorized to institute upon request made of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13480)|
| 3:44:47| or complaint made to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13487)|
| 3:44:48| That's lawyer talk that just says they can bring an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13488)|
| 3:44:52| And that is 47-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13492)|
| 3:44:56| I want to talk for just a second about 8-47-107 with regards to an ouster proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13496)|
| 3:45:02| The state law, I believe, is very clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13502)|
| 3:45:05| No person shall be excused from testifying before the Attorney General and reporter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13505)|
| 3:45:10| District Attorney General, or anyone conducting an investigation of an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13510)|
| 3:45:14| They cannot take the Fifth Amendment, as I understand this statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13514)|
| 3:45:18| They cannot willingly withhold information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13518)|
| 3:45:22| And any testimony that is given in an ouster suit cannot be used in a criminal matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13522)|
| 3:45:31| It says on the ground that such person's testimony may incriminate such person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13531)|
| 3:45:34| but no person shall be prosecuted or punished on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13534)|
| 3:45:39| which such person shall be compelled to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13539)|
| 3:45:43| Nor shall such testimony be used against such person in prosecutions for any crime or misdemeanor under the laws of this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13543)|
| 3:45:49| The General Assembly had anticipated this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13549)|
| 3:45:52| And so they're saying that if there is an ouster proceeding, nothing in that proceeding can be used in a criminal action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13552)|
| 3:45:59| So the Governor also can do what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13559)|
| 3:46:04| There can be a suspension hearing, as we mentioned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13564)|
| 3:46:07| I believe that there are two avenues that are available to us, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13567)|
| 3:46:12| First, filing a formal ouster suit with the Attorney General, not requesting it, but saying we want an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13572)|
| 3:46:19| At that point, they will put in motion a suspension hearing, which will be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13579)|
| 3:46:24| We could look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13584)|
| 3:46:25| There would be a suspension of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13585)|
| 3:46:28| There is another side to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13588)|
| 3:46:30| If they come back and say that there are not grounds here for an ouster suit, they come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13590)|
| 3:46:34| They get the back pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13594)|
| 3:46:35| They get back benefits and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| But another remedy that we have is under our Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| It's called a 202-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13599)|
| 3:46:41| We have never really invoked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| We did have a meeting with Mayor Ragsdale, but that was not a formal 202-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13603)|
| 3:46:47| Under a formal 202-H, we would be empowered to hold a hearing, subpoena witnesses, put them under oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13607)|
| 3:46:54| and gather any information that we felt would be desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13614)|
| 3:46:57| Now, this is not an ouster hearing, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13617)|
| 3:47:00| So anyone that comes before us would be able to take the Fifth Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13620)|
| 3:47:05| But if we were to choose to do that, I believe that it would behoove us to have outside counsel here that would act as our attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13625)|
| 3:47:12| because this would be a legal proceeding, would be like a courtroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13632)|
| 3:47:14| and that perhaps that we look at bringing in a former federal judge, such as a Robert Marion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13634)|
| 3:47:19| who is a former administrative law judge, to actually administer the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13639)|
| 3:47:22| because you will have attorneys on both sides and there will need to be some person here who is informed about the law to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13642)|
| 3:47:30| So I am in favor of Mr. Wright's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13650)|
| 3:47:33| I have signed on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| But I guess I'm looking for a little bit more teeth in it after the research that I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13655)|
| 3:47:40| And I'm looking for the ouster suit immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13660)|
| 3:47:44| And if we're not going to go that direction, then let's go ahead and bring in a 202-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13664)|
| 3:47:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13668)|
| 3:47:49| I appreciate the indulgence of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13669)|
| 3:47:53| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13673)|
| 3:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13675)|
| 3:47:58| The problem I have with this, in addition to I am concerned that an ouster suit would hinder a criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13678)|
| 3:48:09| I'm not saying that my concern is so great that it would stop me from supporting this, but that is a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13689)|
| 3:48:17| I'm also concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13697)|
| 3:48:20| I want to understand exactly what you're saying now when you say that you take out the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13700)|
| 3:48:26| directed to an employee and attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13706)|
| 3:48:29| Are you saying that if it becomes necessary, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13709)|
| 3:48:34| if Mr. Jarrett says that he has a conflict with something that we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13714)|
| 3:48:40| that you're saying we authorize the chair at that point to hire an outside attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13720)|
| 3:48:45| Or are you saying that you want that to happen now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13725)|
| 3:48:51| I believe there was a little bit more that was tied to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13731)|
| 3:48:56| and that it be someone that be knowledgeable of what's taking place in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13736)|
| 3:49:01| Lots of ifs, ands, and buts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13741)|
| 3:49:03| If the chairman of commission thought that it was necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13743)|
| 3:49:08| then he would be empowered to do such without having to assemble us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13748)|
| 3:49:13| And let's talk about it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13753)|
| 3:49:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13756)|
| 3:49:17| I'm personally not in favor of hiring outside counsel to represent the commission right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13757)|
| 3:49:22| I think Mr. Jarrett is doing an exceptional job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13762)|
| 3:49:25| I don't think that we need to incur any more expense for the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13765)|
| 3:49:30| So that's the problem that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13770)|
| 3:49:33| I don't mind giving the chair the authorization to hire someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13773)|
| 3:49:40| If Mr. Jarrett ever states that he has a conflict of interest and needs to step back from an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13780)|
| 3:49:46| I think at that point we need to hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13786)|
| 3:49:49| But I would want to make it clear that I don't support that action at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13789)|
| 3:49:54| And that's the problem that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13794)|
| 3:49:57| I agree with all your whereases and sections and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13797)|
| 3:50:02| But that is a problem that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13802)|
| 3:50:08| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13808)|
| 3:50:12| I just wanted to say that I had signed on to Commissioner Wright's resolution here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13812)|
| 3:50:17| because we, as county commissioners, answer to the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13817)|
| 3:50:22| And that is my only priority that I have up here as being a county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13822)|
| 3:50:28| is to represent what the people are calling me, emailing me, and stopping me on the street and telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13828)|
| 3:50:35| And their main goal is that they want our law director Lockett out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13835)|
| 3:50:42| As far as an ouster suit by the people, that looks like that's going to take 14 months in order to get it put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13842)|
| 3:50:52| you know, on the ballot and all, which is way too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13852)|
| 3:50:55| As far as a criminal investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13855)|
| 3:50:58| I don't think it's Knox County Commission's business to be dealing in a criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13858)|
| 3:51:04| Our number one goal is to get Mr. Lockett, our law director, out like the people are wanting as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13864)|
| 3:51:14| So I will vote for whatever needs to be done in terms of moving that right along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13874)|
| 3:51:21| and making sure that we, as county commissioners, are doing everything that's within our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13881)|
| 3:51:27| I don't like to use the word power, but within our realm of getting this taken care of for the people and for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13887)|
| 3:51:39| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13899)|
| 3:51:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13901)|
| 3:51:45| There's a couple of issues here for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13905)|
| 3:51:49| One, I think most all of you know that I know Mr. Lockett for a long time, and so that makes it a difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13909)|
| 3:51:57| I'm perfectly in agreement with the board and how we've acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13917)|
| 3:52:01| I think it's in the best interest of Knox County and Mr. Lockett for him to go ahead and resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13921)|
| 3:52:06| And from a professional standpoint, I'm suffering with him because his life is forever changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13926)|
| 3:52:17| And so I want this to be over as fast as we can for him and for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13937)|
| 3:52:22| They're both going to be parallel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13942)|
| 3:52:26| They're going to be helpful to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13946)|
| 3:52:28| Now, I want to remind the board that Mr. Jarrett has said at least three times today that we have pursued all legal avenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13948)|
| 3:52:37| that are available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13957)|
| 3:52:40| It sounds like we're moving towards doing one of two things, or maybe both of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13960)|
| 3:52:46| petitioning the State Attorney General for an ouster suit and then possibly us acting as the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13966)|
| 3:52:54| and designing our own ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13974)|
| 3:52:58| I guess one thing that I hope this never goes to, because I can't imagine a worse situation for this commission to be requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13978)|
| 3:53:09| in a 202-H, that kind of inquiry, the kind of legal convolutions that we'd have to go through to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=13989)|
| 3:53:20| It's never been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14000)|
| 3:53:21| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| There's no way I'm going to be in support of that at any time ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14003)|
| 3:53:28| Now, I do have a question for Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14008)|
| 3:53:31| Mr. Jarrett, if we were to pursue an ouster, compare for us the pursuit of an ouster on our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14011)|
| 3:53:39| and the pursuit of an ouster through the State Attorney General, the legal processes, the efficiency of either path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14019)|
| 3:53:49| whether they're both necessary in your group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14029)|
| 3:53:52| You know it's the sentiment of this board to do whatever we can as quick as we can and get over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14032)|
| 3:54:00| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14040)|
| 3:54:01| What do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14041)|
| 3:54:02| Mr. Chair, members of the board, I think the distinction is when you solicit from the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14042)|
| 3:54:07| and ask him or her to file an ouster suit, the way the statute reads, first there's an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14047)|
| 3:54:14| If upon knowledge and belief of the Attorney General there are no grounds for an ouster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14054)|
| 3:54:19| then he or she is not compelled to file one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14059)|
| 3:54:22| However, 10 citizens need not go through that extra mental gymnastics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14062)|
| 3:54:26| If they feel it's enough, they can file the suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14066)|
| 3:54:29| Under the State of Tennessee, they're called freeholders slash realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14069)|
| 3:54:34| In other words, people with a vested interest in the community tend to come forward, they sign the petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14074)|
| 3:54:40| they can contemporaneously with filing the petition seek a suspension hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14080)|
| 3:54:47| and ask that the law director be suspended during the pendency of the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14087)|
| 3:54:51| So in terms of efficiency, it would be quicker were 10 citizens to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14091)|
| 3:54:59| As long as those 10 citizens, and I know lawyers are always fond of saying you need a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14099)|
| 3:55:05| but when you're dealing with something that's hypertechnical where you have a statute that is very tight in its parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14105)|
| 3:55:12| it's best that those 10 citizens have legal counsel to draft the complaint, to seek redress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14112)|
| 3:55:16| to seek the emergency hearing only because for legal sufficiency you don't want the petition dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14116)|
| 3:55:22| for failure to follow the procedural guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14122)|
| 3:55:26| Then you start from square one and you've wasted time and energy and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14126)|
| 3:55:29| But I think that's the key distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14129)|
| 3:55:31| The state attorney general in the ultimate end does not have to file that ouster if she or he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14131)|
| 3:55:37| I don't see grounds, and they can then refuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14137)|
| 3:55:40| Does that answer your question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14140)|
| 3:55:44| So if we're just talking about the action of this body, though, not taking the citizen route into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14144)|
| 3:55:54| so if the body, if this body chooses to ouster, to pursue an ouster complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14154)|
| 3:56:02| what are we looking at just with that from a legal standpoint, the length of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14162)|
| 3:56:07| the time of the amount of legal apparatus that's necessary for that to go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14167)|
| 3:56:14| Well, it would require at least 10 commissioners to sign the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14174)|
| 3:56:17| The petition would then be filed with the court and a hearing requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14177)|
| 3:56:20| Now, in terms of the timeliness, the person against whom you're proceeding will have a right to file an answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14180)|
| 3:56:28| a response of pleading within 20 days, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14188)|
| 3:56:31| But in that intervening time, the court can hold an emergency hearing relative to the potential for suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14191)|
| 3:56:41| But there is due process built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14201)|
| 3:56:43| Even though you can ask for an immediate hearing relative to temporary suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14203)|
| 3:56:47| trying to compel the court to immediately rule is not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14207)|
| 3:56:51| There's going to be an answer filed and then hearing set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14211)|
| 3:56:55| and then a judge only, not a jury, will review the case on its merits by taking testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14215)|
| 3:57:01| and then ultimately rendering decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14221)|
| 3:57:03| So I'm just wondering if this is all just a bit redundant if we compare the actions of the Board of Professional Responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14223)|
| 3:57:12| and the State Supreme Court going through with their own processes as they've already started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14232)|
| 3:57:19| Are we going to expedite, in your professional view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14239)|
| 3:57:26| are we expediting the removal of Mr. Lockett from this position by taking an ouster suit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14246)|
| 3:57:35| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14255)|
| 3:57:36| I mean, an ouster suit by its own nature is designed to expeditiously remove someone from office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14256)|
| 3:57:42| and it's infinitely more expedient than, say, recall, which requires citizen petitions, putting it on the ballot, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14262)|
| 3:57:48| So realistically, within a matter of days, any attorney who's actually dealt in this body of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14268)|
| 3:57:54| and again, it's important that an attorney experienced in these matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14274)|
| 3:57:59| not someone who generally does personal injuries and wants to try their hand at ouster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14279)|
| 3:58:02| If you have an experienced attorney who knows how to file the petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14282)|
| 3:58:05| and do so within the confines of the statute, then conceivably, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14285)|
| 3:58:11| it could be a more expedient method to at least attempt to oust the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14291)|
| 3:58:20| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14300)|
| 3:58:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14302)|
| 3:58:23| I don't believe there's anybody here that's really against this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14303)|
| 3:58:28| But like Commissioner Norman said, we tried this 202H here over a year and a half ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14308)|
| 3:58:33| and didn't get anywhere with it, so we're not going to get anywhere with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14313)|
| 3:58:36| But being a complainant in an ouster suit for a year and a half now, we've gotten nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14316)|
| 3:58:47| Now, let me tell you how fast this deal is working now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14327)|
| 3:58:53| Last week before last, I believe it was, the TBI interviewed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14333)|
| 3:59:00| They've got on that that fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14340)|
| 3:59:02| On the ouster suit, they had not interviewed me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14342)|
| 3:59:07| They said they were going to interview me at the same time on the ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14347)|
| 3:59:11| Now, that's how fast this thing is progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14351)|
| 3:59:14| Now, we also have the Board of Professional Responsibility looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14354)|
| 3:59:20| It's very possible that we could mess up these two by us filing an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14360)|
| 3:59:27| Now, as Commissioner Hammond said there, he read it in the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14367)|
| 3:59:32| and that's exactly what the district attorney really said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14372)|
| 3:59:37| that if we keep getting involved in this, we could mess this case up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14377)|
| 3:59:42| and it could turn out to be double jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14382)|
| 3:59:45| So I think that we've done everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14385)|
| 3:59:47| and I think everybody here wants this matter put behind us as fast as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14387)|
| 3:59:52| But I have never seen the TBI act this fast on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14392)|
| 3:59:57| They were acting on this in less than three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14397)|
| 4:00:00| The Board of Professionals was already acting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14400)|
| 4:00:03| So I think we need to let it take its course because we could be cutting our nose off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14403)|
| 4:00:10| to spite in their face by interfering with this and blocking what needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14410)|
| 4:00:16| and taking a longer process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14416)|
| 4:00:19| But I will vote for the resolution if that's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14419)|
| 4:00:22| But if something like this happens and we kill this to where we can't get this gentleman out of office fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14422)|
| 4:00:31| or something, like I say, our ouster suit has been going on for a year and a half now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14431)|
| 4:00:37| And we kill this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14437)|
| 4:00:38| I would like for the people that have pushed this through to stand up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14438)|
| 4:00:43| Well, we made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14443)|
| 4:00:45| We didn't listen to the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14445)|
| 4:00:46| We didn't listen to the district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14446)|
| 4:00:48| We didn't let the TBI do their job like we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14448)|
| 4:00:52| Now, I just feel like that this thing is on a fast track right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14452)|
| 4:00:56| And what I'm basing it on is the ouster suit that I'm complaining in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14456)|
| 4:01:01| But I will vote for it if that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14461)|
| 4:01:03| But if anything happens, I want these people that are pushing this to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14463)|
| 4:01:08| and say they made a mistake when we can't get this gentleman out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090622part1?start=14468)|
