| 0:02:41| Any opposed? The ayes have it and the consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| For the Mayor's Report, first I want to recognize a Boy Scout who was with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| His troop actually came a couple weeks ago, but he had another event he had to be at, so he's with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| Will you please stand, Joshua Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| He's with Boy Scout Troop 213 from Washington Pike United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| and he's joined by his dad and Boy Scout leader, Kerry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| So first I want to make sure that everybody knows that a draft version of our new zoning ordinance has been published online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| This is the next step in the Recode Knoxville effort that has been underway since last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| Our consultants prepared a draft with recommendations for changes to many of our zoning districts and uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| The draft, again it is a draft, is available online at RecodeKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| It is very detailed. It's over 200 pages long, but there's also a shorter presentation provided that goes over the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=221)|
| 0:03:49| There's also information there on how to provide feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| I urge everyone to take a look and let MPC and all of us know what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| Questions, comments, and concerns are all welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| We haven't completely overhauled our zoning code in nearly 60 years, so we want to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| And, of course, eventually there will be a final draft that will be prepared and submitted to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| and this council will have the opportunity to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| There are also a number of public meetings that will be held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| so you can also find that information on the website at RecodeKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| Tomorrow, March 28th, there will be a ribbon-cutting at 1030 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| for the new affordable housing units at Restoration House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| which is located at 2205 Village Place Way in northwest Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| This is the first of the projects funded with our new affordable rental development program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| Council members will remember you voted to support it in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| And, of course, you have another affordable rental project to approve on your agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| So this is a great opportunity tomorrow to see the new facility at Restoration House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| and the results of that support from council and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| It would be great to see everyone there tomorrow at 1030 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| And I want to remind everyone that city offices will be closed this Friday, March 30th, in observance of the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| Garbage and recycling pickup will continue as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Hope everyone has a great weekend with family and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| This weekend is also the kickoff of the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| The dogwood trails will be marked and ready by this Thursday, March 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| Hopefully the weather will cooperate and we get a nice dogwood blooming season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| And then next weekend comes the musical part of dogwood with the Rhythm and Blooms Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| As usual, they have a great lineup of more than 40 acts who will be playing at venues throughout the Old City from April 6th to April 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=344)|
| 0:05:53| You can get information about that and everything related to dogwood arts at dogwoodarts.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| There are two people, our community lost two folks over the last few days that I want to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| The first was the passing of Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| And those of us who were at the Neighborhood Conference, we did do a tribute to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| But I wanted to pay respect here as well because city council meetings were kind of like Lynn's home away from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=375)|
| 0:06:25| I have no idea how many hundreds of meetings he must have sat through over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| I know we saw him as recently as just a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| Lynn was a great model of civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| He studied the issues, he knew the players, and he knew how to talk about difficult topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| in a way that always respected the process even when he didn't agree with the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| And as I mentioned on Saturday, he was in it for the long haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| He knew it was a long game that sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| But if you want to impact and continue to improve your community, you stay in the game, you learn about the players,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| you learn the situations and the other viewpoints, and you stick with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| And that's something that he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| He was also active in local politics in many ways in many of our campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| He helped us particularly with voter data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| But I think his most lasting contribution was through his tireless dedication to neighborhood advocacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| and to Norwood in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| So we will all miss him and his steady presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| Also in the paper today, it mentioned a community leader and a businessman, Emmett P. Vaughn, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=443)|
| 0:07:32| known as Buck Vaughn to many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| He served as CEO and chairman of the Emmett Vaughn Lumber Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| which his parents founded actually back in 1956 until he closed the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| It was a South Knoxville-based company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| He closed the doors a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| But beyond the business world, he was known for his support of many of our local community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=470)|
| 0:07:58| and nonprofit groups like Boys and Girls Clubs of Tennessee Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| Helen Ross McNabb Foundation, Interfaith Health Clinic, Second Harvest Food Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| and Emerald Youth Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| He served on the boards and was past president of several of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| He received numerous awards, including Outstanding Civic Leader of East Tennessee in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| He was one of the founders of the Greater Knoxville Sports Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| UT graduate, Army officer, paratrooper, and had a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=503)|
| 0:08:31| Our hearts go out to Linda Chapman Vaughn and his two daughters and his stepson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=511)|
| 0:08:39| and he will also be missed by this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| So, Council, that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| Are there any reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| It's great to see such a good crowd here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| and I wanted to take this moment to let you know how our team for City Council did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| at the North Knoxville Business and Professional Association's bowling tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| As you know, our City Council team, the Scruffy City All-Stars, were challenged by the county team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| and I'm happy to announce that we won, 1,259 points to 1,170 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=554)|
| 0:09:23| And I know you were nervous about that, Mayor, but we did pull it through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| and I wanted you to know that that was mainly because of Councilman Campin, who scored 509 of our points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| But anyway, we all had a great time raising money for a good cause and supporting Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| Councilman Roberto, I think something else important happened in your life since our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| I didn't want to bury the lead, but I also got married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=584)|
| 0:09:53| Councilwoman St. Croix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=593)|

| 0:12:12| I got the emails earlier today inquiring about two things in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| whether the licensing requirements have changed with the new ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| as well as the work that's exempt from permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| Both of those are exactly the same as they currently read in the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| The licensing requirements mirror those of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| and the work that's exempt from permits like a fence, minor work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| that's the same language that we have currently adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| And just for the audience, these all the way down through J,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| these are all having to do with the building codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| and various building codes in the appeals board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=771)|

| 0:17:21| but just wanted to mention a few things since we have so many of our firefighters here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| to celebrate this 100th anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| Last year there were over 24,000 calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| and over 40,000 responses that were made by our fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| The fire department has achieved a class two fire department rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| and they're working towards accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| These efforts reduce insurance costs to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| and encourage people to move and businesses to operate in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| What you might find interesting for some of you at home or some of you here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| that everyone knows that firefighters respond to fire calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| but they also respond to medical emergencies, hazardous material calls, vehicle extrications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| and public assistance calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| The Firefighters Association Local 65 has also been serving our community in a number of other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| It's just an unbelievable listing of accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| They fully fund the city's Learn Not to Burn program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| They've donated over $100,000 to the University of Tennessee Cancer Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| They've donated over $50,000 for Children's Hospital and Ronald McDonald House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1115)|

| 0:18:49| They also provide assistance in the Burnout Program to victims of fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| not just in Knoxville but in all many, many surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| And Local 65 has bought new coats for the children at Smoky Mountain Children's Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| and foster care for approximately 750 children over the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| So just wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate you on 100 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1150)|

| 0:19:36| Mayor, do you think Mr. Faddis might come down and say a few words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| I was hoping he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| He's usually at a loss for words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1181)|

| 0:19:59| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| First off, I want to thank you all for the recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| 100 years as an association is a tremendous accomplishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| especially with everything going on in the world today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| Second, these guys and girls here, I mean, they're the backbone of this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1216)|
| 0:20:25| They really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| A lot of them couldn't be here because they're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| A lot of them are at baseball practice with their kids or doing schoolwork with their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| So these guys, they come out when you call them, just like they do in the fires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| or any type of call that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| These guys right here are the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| These guys are the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| These guys are the ones who put their butts on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| So I thank them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| So thank you guys for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1252)|

| 0:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| I also personally want to add I've had the pleasure of working with the Firefighters Association Local 65| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| throughout my six-plus-a-few-months time as mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| and still have about 22 months or so to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| but I have truly appreciated working with all of you, appreciate what you do every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| Of course, Kevin has represented you on our Employees Rep Committee and has done a great job at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| always challenging us, which is what his job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| It is noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| It is recognized in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| We hear it a lot in the community how grateful they are to you, not only for fighting the fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| but as Councilman Roberto mentioned, the emergency response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| and, of course, all that you do to give back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1323)|

| 0:22:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| 11B is the resolution approving a contract between the City of Knoxville and Crosland PLLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| to audit the accounts of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal years ending 2018, 2019, and 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| for a total contract price of $493,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Just a brief summary of what we're doing here for the new members and those not on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| One of the main things the audit committee does is oversee the external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| Their main job is to do an audit every year and prepare the city's financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| For the last five years, it's actually been Crosland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| They had a three-year contract with two extra years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| And so we put it back out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| There was a selection committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| I wasn't on the committee, but Crosland was selected again, and they do a good job and very professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| And so tonight we're just approving that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| I think Mr. York is here, and I would be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| And I forgot to mention one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| The audit committee is meeting tomorrow at 430 in the council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| It's a public meeting, of course, and it will be as exciting as it sounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1423)|
| 0:23:54| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a cross-access and parking easement agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| for a portion of city-owned property located at 923 and Zero Baker Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| to enable South High LLC and Knox County ingress, egress, and parking upon and across the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1445)|
| 0:24:15| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| I see that Mr. Dover is here and Ms. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| And I'm wondering if someone could come up and just give us an update on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| I'm really excited about it, just kind of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| I can speak to this cross-access easement just to explain that this is to allow the developers of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1479)|
| 0:24:47| to drive across a city driveway that goes into the Cecil Webb Rec Center to allow for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| This is at the side and back of the building, so this isn't the main entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| but it will allow the development to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| And I will have to defer to Mr. Dover to update us on the timeline for South High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| I know they're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Thank you, Ms. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Mr. Dover, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Rick Dover, 4921 Homburg Drive, Dover Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1516)|
| 0:25:24| Ms. Welch, the South High plans have been finished now by Barbara McMurray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| and they've been sent to the State Historic Preservation Office for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| That got done several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| They came back for some suggested changes, which were minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| Those have been done and resubmitted to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| Those will then eventually go to Washington for approval from the Park Service and Department of Interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| We're ready to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| So as soon as we get approval back from Historic in Nashville or Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1551)|
| 0:26:00| either one of them will allow us to go ahead and complete the balance of the construction documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| and then we're ready to start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| That sounds like a simple process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1577)|

| 0:26:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with ECG Martin Mill GP LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| to award $360,000 from the Affordable Rental Development Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1589)|

| 0:26:40| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1600)|

| 0:26:42| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| I have a comment and then a couple of questions about this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| which I know is we've previously approved funding through the Affordable Housing Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| but I know that we're still new and we're learning about it, so I have a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| But first of all, I just want to say this is in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| and I think this particular development is of interest to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| because there's a housing boom in South Knoxville right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| and there's a lot of market rate housing that's being built along the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| There's a lot of property that's being redeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| and sold at probably a higher value than it has been for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1641)|
| 0:27:30| So this, to me, I think is a perfect location for a workforce housing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| that brings a more diverse housing stock into an area that is becoming less and less affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1657)|
| 0:27:45| So the location is great, and it's particularly nice because oftentimes people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| this is targeting I think 60% of the median household income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| and oftentimes people who can afford that level of housing may not have access to the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1676)|
| 0:28:04| that are also coming into this area with market rate housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| So the restaurants, the urban wilderness, the other amenities that oftentimes are not accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| to people who may have limited income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| So I think this is in my district, so I'm really pleased that this is going in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| So I wanted to make that comment, and I wanted to see if either Ms. Wade or Mr. Shepard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| who is here from the Elmington Group, wanted to add anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| And then, Ms. Wade, I have a question for you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| Yeah, we started talking about this development in July of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| That's when Elmington Capital first came to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| and started expressing some interest in this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| and talking about the ability to do affordable housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| And right from the beginning, I have to agree with you, I thought this is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| This is a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| It's on a bus line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| It has access to jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| It can really create a mixed-income neighborhood in the south waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| because we have lots of market-rate rental going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| We had new market-rate rental going in down at Island Home and Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| And so this just creates another option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| an option for families that have less income to be able to take advantage of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| And I did a little research on the developer, looked at some of their other units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| and they're really, truly quality units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| This will be a lovely, beautiful housing development where anyone would be proud to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1787)|
| 0:29:56| And so we've worked with them over the years, the last almost two years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| through a number of things to get this thing to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| So I'm very happy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| I'm pleased about it and can't wait to have it get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| And could we just explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| So this is totally 172 units, but right here it says 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| so I don't want people to think that's all that's going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Our program is structured so that we provide assistance up to $30,000 per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1825)|
| 0:30:35| So our $360,000 of the Affordable Housing Fund is supporting 12 of the 172 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1835)|
| 0:30:44| But we also have home funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| We're providing $540,000 in federal home funds to support 27 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1846)|
| 0:30:55| And that was approved in our annual action plan last year, this whole development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| The total development is affordable for families at 60% of the median income or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| Our assistance helps fill a gap in financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| and the way we've structured it is at a per unit cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Yes, I have another question for Ms. Wade, and then I'm sure others do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| So you may be referencing this in your last comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| but are there criteria that are used to determine what the subsidy level is that's provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| Is there some type of calculation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| How do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| We underwrite every project to make sure that it isn't oversubsidized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| We look at costs to make sure that they are based on industry standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| We look at the fees that are included in the development budget to make sure that those aren't out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| And then we find out through evaluating all the sources of funds and the uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| is there truly a gap, and we plug our money in to fill that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| And the other need we're meeting is to provide affordable housing for the community, which is very much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| So to us, that is a community benefit that the city is receiving from this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| So just curious, you mentioned other projects that you looked at that ECG had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| Are they local here in Knoxville, or are they elsewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| They're in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| And some others also, but those are the ones we looked at was in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| This is the first project they're building here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| They have purchased, I believe, they've purchased some existing properties here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| Are the other properties affordable as well, or are they market rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| I'm going to bring John Shepard up with Elmington Capital Group to answer some of these specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| Thank you, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| Please state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| John Shepard, 118 16th Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| I'm a developer with Elmington Capital Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| To answer your question, so we own two communities here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| One of them is a conditional market rate apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| It used to be called Country Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| It's now called Elevation Knoxville on Paper Mill just outside 640, just west of 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| And the other one is West Vista Ridge, which is on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| And that is an affordable property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| The rents there are restricted to 80% of area median income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| which is a little bit higher than what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| but it does have those affordability restrictions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| And then so of the 172 units, are they all affordable in the proposed budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| They are all affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| It's 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| There are actually some that are restricted to 50% AMI and for a minimum term of 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| So the restriction, and this may be a question for Ms. Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| but so they're only guaranteed to be affordable for 20 years with this agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| but the loan is forgivable and is for a term of 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| So they could be in loan forgiveness or in a term of loan with the city for five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| and be at market rate in that last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| So the likely scenario is that this property will be affordable for at least 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| which is the affordability restrictions imposed by the Tennessee Housing Development Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Our loan on the property, our primary mortgage, is a 15-year loan term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| And the reason that these funds were structured as a 25-year loan term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| is because of the underwriting on that senior mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| If they had to show a large bullet payment on this loan due, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| quick after the refinance of that senior mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| they would not be able to underwrite the loan proceeds that they have for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| So you project that they'll be affordable for 30 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Typically after 15 years or 20 years, any apartment community needs significant reinvestment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| and there's a mechanism for that under the Federal Housing Tax Credit Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| which is another large source of funds for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| So that would, when you take advantage of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| it extends the affordability period for at least another 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Oh, and then one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| This particular development and your other developments, they're strictly housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| They don't include any wraparound services of any sort, supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| This property will have a small supportive services element designed around families with children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2159)|
| 0:36:08| and the extent of that is Elmington has an affiliated nonprofit called Elevates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| that provides kind of a range of philanthropic services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| In this case, we're going to provide an on-site children's library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| and referral services to other service providers in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| That's the extent of the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| So targeted at families with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Families with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Mr. Shepherd, thanks for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| Can you talk a little bit about how you've reached out to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| If you've reached out to the community, some of the ways that you've done that and what you've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| So early on, about a year ago, we had a community meeting, and I believe you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| At my neighborhood meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| The stakes were high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| So fortunately, that went well, and there was a lot of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| I think there were probably 50 or 75 people at that meeting and a lot of questions and feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| and I think, in general, the feedback was very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| Another thing we did early on was meet with the council member for the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| and get the perspective of Councilman Pavlis at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| and then also the Community Development Office and Becky and her team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| and also meet with our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| So one of the early conversations we had was with the Aslan Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| who, as you know, is very active in South Knoxville and is actually our neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| It's a Fort Stanley property that abuts ours and are making a lot of investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| and plan future investments in restoring that historic fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| as well as a network of trails through that property, and so we wanted to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| We showed them our architectural plans, our site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| and actually got their feedback and revised those plans as a result of some of that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| We spoke with the multimodal transit folks at the city about the extension of the Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| and bike path along Chapman Highway and or along East Martin Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| and have made it clear that we want to participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| We would love to align our development with that and support and take advantage of that multimodal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| those multimodal transit efforts that are underway in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| So those are a few of the things that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| I do want to add at that meeting, Becky and I were both there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| because the meeting was held right before our neighborhood meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| and it was really a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| You all did a great job in presenting what your plans were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| And afterwards, our neighborhood met and voted to support the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| And I have to say, it was the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Becky and I didn't drive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| We certainly voted in support of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| so it was great to see our neighbors so supportive of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| All right, so thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2342)|

| 0:43:45| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| This looks like just allowing for an agreement for a gateway project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| But looking at this, I don't know if anybody else had this feeling looking at the rendering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| but I personally was a little underwhelmed by the monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2643)|
| 0:44:13| Thinking back about this process for the members that weren't here, this was somewhat contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| When we approved this plan, it was sort of a feeling that the city was coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| and sort of not listening to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| So I think, and I don't really know what would be ideal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| but I think this is potentially a great opportunity to engage the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| and really get something that the community would be proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| and a process that really involved different people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2686)|
| 0:44:55| I'm not sure exactly what that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| But looking at this, it's not awful, but it sort of looks like it would be in any subdivision anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2699)|
| 0:45:09| And so to me, something that reflects the culture or the history, art, or just something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| And maybe we can't find anything better, and we still have this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| but I would like to potentially try to start the discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2720)|
| 0:45:28| In terms of a timeline, it's not supposed to be built until the end of 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| so there's potentially a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| But I think this is an opportunity to really try to get some buy-in from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2736)|
| 0:45:44| for a potentially different gateway marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| Thank you. I'd like to call on Dawn Michelle Foster to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| Yes, Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Dawn Michelle Foster, Director in the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| When we went through the initial public meeting, we did have the gateway monuments to mimic Choway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2755)|
| 0:46:03| When we went through that process, we found out from TDOT that you could not have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| well, the pillars were too tall, and then we would have to put them up on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| and we could not have them in – you had to be behind a clear zone in order for vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| or anybody not to hit them on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Then we had the CAT employee parking lot constructed, and when we came to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| we wanted to talk about, when that parking lot was on that corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| that we would provide a monument that would shield that corner with some landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| and be part of our streetscape effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| If you looked into the email that I had sent you, there's a TDOT Memorandum 1401| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| that talks about specific gateway monuments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| It is somewhat limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| It gives you the criterias and also the do's and don'ts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| and it addresses public expression and the types of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| that could be displayed on the gateway monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| We have taken that to several communities and received very well –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| it was very well received in what's displayed on the gateway monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| There's other opportunities that I am looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| I'm talking to the Knoxville History Project in regards to providing some type of other public art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| that could be displayed to create a sense of place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| and historic significance along the corridor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| But in the shape of the gateway monument, shielding the CAT parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| and providing the information, we have taken it to several communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| and continue to do so because we have until 2019 to get all the streetscape completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Any other – Councilman Romero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| Director Foster, I guess can you talk a little bit about the limiting that you had from TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| Maybe explain that a little bit more and whether or not there –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| if you can give us a little more detail about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| and then opportunities we may have in the future to have some additional community reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| that you had already talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Sure. So this is an executive summary that I also sent to you all as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| The executive summary reads, located outside of the safety clear zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| which we have done, freestanding, ground-mounted, may incorporate community name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2906)|
| 0:48:35| maximum size 25 foot in width, and we have that 10 feet high in some places, and it varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| Most importantly in the shall nots, it shall not contain religious, political, commercial, et cetera, messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| contained advertisements, decorative banners, non-government flags,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| include reflective or glaring surface finishes, no water features, and blinking intermittent lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| and it goes on and on in your memorandum that was sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| We looked at this criteria and got it approved in order to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| to have the license agreement to sign off with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| Again, we are taking these through the communities as we speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| and we have several meetings starting next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| January kind of threw us off because of the snow, so we're kind of behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| but we are engaged with the neighborhood meetings each month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| to update them on the streetscape project as well as the Gateway Monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| Ms. Foster, thank you so much, and I know that you reviewed this information in the workshop that we had as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2976)|
| 0:49:44| While a few people may feel like it's not the most pleasing or they're not exactly happy with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| you did explain to us the scope of why, you know, the height, the width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| and that it would shield the parking lot there from CAT as well, which would be unsightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| So if you're familiar with Magnolia, you know, and from the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| we're dealing with a couple of different circumstances that are somewhat limiting as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| but thank you for being open and sharing this with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| and continuing to get their input to see if there is some accommodations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| particularly that could be made at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3024)|

| 0:51:43| to fully negotiate the terms of the development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| as well as to allow the purchaser adequate time to produce schematic designs and specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| I don't know if I can squeak this out or not, but give us an update of how we got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| and then I'll, and you got Rick here, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| I'm really interested in the dates, on what dates, what specific dates you're really asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3129)|
| 0:52:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Well, thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| We got here, as you know, and some of you on Council were here earlier when we brought to you a purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3140)|
| 0:52:27| and sale agreement that anticipated a later development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| and that development agreement is going to follow a lot of very specific design work, site work, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| and we set out a timeline that we hoped we could meet and the developer could meet at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| and we've since passed those limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| Not through, by my, parenthetically, not through anybody's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| There's been back and forth continually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| We've pushed back on some of the earlier designs that we thought didn't quite meet what we had asked for in the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| and they have, you know, gone right back and reworked the project somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| So what we're doing is asking just to extend this timeline by some of the dates that are specified here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| and add a few months to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| The main, I think, point of importance is, I don't know to the degree to which this has been approved by Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3197)|
| 0:53:26| we have requested an April 19th workshop date at which time we could prevent the schematics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| and the, hopefully, development agreement or the better part of the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| So we wanted some time to reach that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| I might add that we also didn't want to immediately have a Council vote the next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| We would later look to having that at least two more weeks so you'd have plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| We've discussed this previously, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| So where we are on the project is that we've been negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| We have had lots of back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| We've had lots of unknown site or unrealized site constraints that forced the design into a different kind of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| and really made the developer have to rework everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| and that's what we've been going through during this interim that pushed us to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| Explain that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| So explain that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| You know, what happened during that period, sort of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Yeah, what was the pushback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| Well, I think, okay, you could probably best specify it in a couple of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| As it turned out, the parking that was needed originally proposed was going to be a wraparound garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| that the scope of the site just ended up not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| It was slightly too small to allow that once the engineers got to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| so it had to be redesigned where there was a pedestal with parking under it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| and that changed the whole parking equation a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| It also affected the layout of the structures on the site such that now what we're looking to do is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| and this is a good thing – is preserve the entire building rather than just the courtroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| and have the hotel shifted and have the apartment shifted to another place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| A lot of it had to do with redesigns largely necessitated by just not quite enough room to have the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3299)|
| 0:55:07| that we hoped we would have in the middle, and that was disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| It was just the reality of the site being just a little smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| and once they got into the civil engineering stage, that became obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Well, I'll go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| So given the back and forth and there's some substantial delays, at a high level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| do we even have a timeframe for completion or even just starting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| I know there's going to be a workshop, but just for the benefit of those that are watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Yes, we have a timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| You never exactly know what completion would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| but we have a timetable that if everything goes well at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| we want council to be able to see before they vote on the bill exactly what this looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| There's a great concern for the aesthetics of the project and for the design of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| So assuming the development agreement is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| Rick, you want to let us know exactly when you think you could begin construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| There's still some period prior to the actual construction beginning and completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| Yes, Rick Dover, Dover Development, 4921 Humber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| The status of it is, time-wise, is that we've asked for a delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| in the contractual deadline for the schematic design presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| That's what we're asking for at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| We would hope by the workshop on the 19th of April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| to be able to present you a draft of the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| and the schematic designs for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| The delay in the schematic design phase of the contract delays the closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| that was originally anticipated in the contract by 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| So it basically pushes us into September to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| And then we would hopefully be ready to go shortly thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| with construction drawings for Mr. Aaron's department to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| and then commence construction once we obtain a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| And so the construction, is this going to be like a year-and-a-half project, two-year project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3437)|
| 0:57:25| Well, I stand before you as somebody that always takes longer than it seems like it ought to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| but hopefully the end is worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| In a project like this, this is a complicated site in a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| Dr. Lyons referred to some of the dimensional constrictions that we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| that were tighter than we need them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| The other problem with this site is you've got about a 70-degree elevation drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| from Locust down to Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| And then the core sampling and the geotechnical work that we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| has produced evidence of substandard existing soils covering pinnacle rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| So you've got fingers of rock sticking up deep, 75 to 30 feet to the top of these pinnacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| So in order to bear the type of construction that Dr. Lyons alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| instead of building a parking garage on top of the ground, it's got to go under the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| That unsuitable soil has to be removed, exported, and taken somewhere off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| And then caissons have to be drilled down into rock pockets on the top of those rock pinnacles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| in order to have enough of a pier support in order for a pad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| which would allow us then to put poured-in-place concrete parking levels in place subterranean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| and then precast concrete above ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| And then the building has to sit on top of the parking deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| So it changes all the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| because the load of the building now has to be supported by the parking deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| which now has to be supported on that pinnacle rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| And so we're just thrown into a whole nother kettle of fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| And it's taken a long time to get that design worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| We think we're ready to perch on a place that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| and present to you next month renderings and a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| that would define all those different mixes of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| and define spaces and activation of Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| and storefront in various areas and retail-type space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| that would, in addition to preserving the existing structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| allow us to produce a building that everybody's very, very proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| and that we can afford to build and that the rents will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| So it's a complicated site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| Part of our delay, candidly, has been we attempted to go back early in the design process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| and create an additional parking level or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| or see what we could produce that could possibly offer some municipal parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| as part of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| And there is a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| Unfortunately, it's extremely expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| And so we've had a lot of conversation around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| That's been something we felt like, and the city staff did too, was a critical element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| If there's any way to produce that in an acceptable level of cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| let's see what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| So we looked at it, and candidly, it was very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| And so when we talk about pushback, things like that came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| And this is all meaningful feedback that we've got to have in order to design a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| that you can look at and that we can ultimately produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| to where ultimately what the city gets is what the city expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| I have to say I think it's been a very collaborative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| It has not been conflicted or dramatic in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| We've worked together, everybody trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| what everybody else's needs are, cards face up on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| And I think we're going to end up with something that you're very, very happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Actually, all I've got to do is announce what's already been announced twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| and that is the workshop on April the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| which will be at the Public Works facility on Morris at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3653)|
| 1:01:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| So for the benefit of those of us who are newer council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| this may be Bill or Mr. Lyons or Mr. Dover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| what date was the Supreme Court built and when was it built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| How long has it been vacant and out of use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| We can get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| I don't know when it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| And its last use, well, it's been at least 20 years, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| but I don't have those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| You know what, the court did move into where they are on Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| and that's been about, I guess, about 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| So it's been entirely vacant for Fall Park 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| There might have been an occasional use in the office building that lagged a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| For all practical purposes, it's been approximately two decades, I believe, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| And then I guess I just was trying to figure out the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| So there was 120 days for site inspection in the original agreement, 120 days for design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3722)|
| 1:02:10| and the request now is to change the 120 to 266?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| The request is to do the original 120 days has passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| and all performance has been done in such a way that the contract is not terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| It's still moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| The contract contemplated a second 120-day period for council to receive schematic design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| hopefully for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| That has proven to take longer than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| and what we've asked is that the schematic design period be extended until the end of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| which would give us time to get in front of council workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| and hopefully full session for consideration of what we hope would be an acceptable schematic design presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| as well as a draft of the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| At that point, hopefully that bar is cleared, the additional earnest money is paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| it then becomes nonrefundable, and closing is contemplated now with this extension to be in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| So, Mr. Dover, how has the development changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| Is there a change in the parking being provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| The change, I'm sorry, Councilman Steyer, you're talking about from the change from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| I guess from the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| From the original design schematic that was part of the RFP response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3813)|
| 1:03:40| parking has been reduced largely because of a reduction in the anticipated number of hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3820)|
| 1:03:48| So the number of multifamily rooms has adjusted somewhat, maybe about 15 units or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3828)|
| 1:03:57| less than what was originally proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| We just can't seem to cram everything onto the site, candidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| The hotel requirement in parking diminished from about 160 to 70 spaces down to approximately 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3843)|
| 1:04:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| So that allowed us to take a level off the parking deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| In light of what we're now going to have to do engineering-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| where we build the multifamily building, we'll sit on top of the parking deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| which is a very expensive way to do that, as we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| We're now dealing with height limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| and in order to make this come in at a manageable cost and keep us out of the high-rise building code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3868)|
| 1:04:36| we needed to work very strictly within a total overall dimension above grade and above that parking deck podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| So we've staggered the height of the multifamily building as it comes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| Remember, we have about 70 feet of elevation change from Locust to Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| so there's some stair-stepping of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| So it just became a little bit more of a complicated building to design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| However, I think ultimately it will be a little bit more aesthetically interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| because we've now got random balconies in places where before we were crammed right to the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| and did not have the right to have balconies overhanging the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| without a use agreement, which is a license from the city, which as a developer you can't finance because it's revocable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| So a lot of these things were in the mix that we didn't know about initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| and ultimately I think the design team's done a great job in producing a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| that everybody's going to be very, very happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| So the number of hotel rooms declined, the number of parking spaces declined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| and the possibility of doing municipal parking as part of the overall project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| just became prohibitively expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| But all these required full fleshing out on the design phase just to get it out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| and see what it could look like and can we work with it, can we not work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| I want to add one thing about the municipal parking because I have heard...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| Go ahead, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Yeah, go ahead, because that's what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| I figured you might be getting there, and we have heard understandably some concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| In the original proposal, Mr. Dover did not propose any municipal parking in his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| The RFP did not demand any or even mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| The goals envisioned for the project, which are the elements by which proposals were evaluated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| just said address structured parking and building services from an internal access point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| which is what was in the request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| There was another page that said when you're making your proposal, not in the evaluated part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| go ahead and address the number of spaces differentiating between public spaces for building occupants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| and spaces dedicated to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| Mr. Dover, as I said, did not ever propose any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| Now, we did attempt to negotiate those with him, and he agreed at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| well, I'll be glad to alter my proposal to provide what you want at cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| We thought that might be viable at first to get a number of spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| but then as the geometry of the site forced the garage to be built in the way that it had to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4022)|
| 1:07:10| these would have to be underground, and the parking that he could provide the city would be prohibitively expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| twice as much as we paid for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| And we said at that point we weren't interested in purchasing those spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| So that's the evolution of the public versus the project parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| and how it fits into the request for proposals and the proposal itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Councilman Steer, may I have just one quick little follow-up as a footnote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| So the process to do this would be we designed a new garage and a new project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| to add what could we add in terms of parking spaces for the city that would be for municipal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| Once that's designed, it's got to go out to the general contractor for pricing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| and the whole idea going forward was whatever our cost is, the city wants these spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| they get them for exactly that price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| There was absolutely no markup, no additional soft costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| It's just the hard costs on these spaces came in in the $40,000 range, and that's just expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4084)|
| 1:08:11| I mean, we can't afford to do it on the private side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| We couldn't do it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| And that was at our cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| So the idea was let's work together to see what this would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| If we could create municipal parking, obviously that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| It could support the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| It could support more retail off Henley or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| It just became prohibitively expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| And at that point, staff's recommendation was let's abandon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| Let's get back to the reason that we're here, which is let's make this a great block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| and let's get back to work on the original proposal, which is what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Thank you, Mr. Dover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| 11-0 is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Bank of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| for comprehensive banking services for three years at a cost not to exceed $165,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| 11-Q is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| to apply for and, if awarded, accept a grant from the Federal Transit Administration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| the Tennessee Department of Transportation to provide funding in the total amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| $156,330 to Knoxville Area Transit for local surface transportation block grant program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4171)|
| 1:09:39| assistance, with an additional city match of up to $39,083 to purchase ADA paratransit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| vans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Hi, Ms. Disler, would you mind answering some questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| Or actually just telling us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| Don Disler, Director of Transit for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| Yes, so this grant is in order to help us to continue to add to our fleet, replacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| vehicles that have reached their useful life, which is for our lift service, which really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| assists the part of our community that is folks who are disabled and folks who can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| use the regular transit system for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| Since the next few items are also yours, would you brag about some of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| Sure, I can brag about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| There's nothing I like better than to brag about CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| Most of these are to continue to keep our fleet in good working order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| This helps us to, of course, keep the community independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| We've got a lot of folks that are staying here, and transit is a very important part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| of a community that's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| Council, as well as the mayor, have been very supportive of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| What we do, we do keep everybody moving and give them independence so that they can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| to stay vibrant in the community, as well as reach their jobs, reach employment, reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4269)|
| 1:11:16| school, all the things that everybody wants to do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| This continues for us to put really nice vehicles out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| I'm just having trouble talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| This also allows the city to look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| It attracts more people to the city because transit is very important to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| Then the big one is the one at the end there, which is a real-time passenger app, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| we have been waiting for for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| I know Councilman Steyer is grinning over there because he's been a big proponent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| this from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| As was Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| I think everybody has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| It was just a matter of making sure we did it in the right way at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| I think this one here is going to be what everybody wants, and we're going to get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| bang for our buck out of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| Looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4333)|

| 1:12:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4336)|

| 1:12:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| I believe Will stated that we were on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| It was 11P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| But you read 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| I read the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| I said Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| You were reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| The right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| Yes, but you said Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Hey, Dawn, will you come down one more second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| I just wanted to ask one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| If electric buses were ever considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| Electric buses are not part of these grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| The electric bus grants were in the Cat Day Mirage that we had a few months back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| We are still waiting to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| Those CMAQ awards have not been announced yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| So we are not sure whether we have that yet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| But these ones here are not for electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| These are for regular hybrid diesel buses, vans, and then also for some technology projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| We're going to have to replace our AVL system soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| Believe it or not, it's old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| And so we're kind of banking some money through one of these grants to also help with that AVL project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| So we are on 11P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4416)|

| 1:15:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| This is something I think is going to be, I may be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| but I think it's going to be a real game changer potentially in transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| Just over the last few years, if you've ever taken Uber, just watching that Uber come to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| mentally it's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| And I ride the bus regularly, and it's really not the wait for the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| Usually it's on schedule, especially on Broadway during the weekday in the mornings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| But a lot of our routes run on hours or 30 minutes, and if you get there sort of when it's supposed to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| sometimes it gets there early, and, you know, your mind starts to play games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| Is it already gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| It's really not the wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| It's just the wait and not knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| If you ever waited on something you don't really know, you know, like the emergency room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| it could be this minute or it could be, you know, in two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| So I think that's a huge plus for the riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| Sort of like having a baby, you don't know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| That's a whole other experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| But I think, you know, the only drawback, I'm sure there's a number of riders that don't have devices that can have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4628)|
| 1:17:18| but I think, you know, I think if you're thinking the long-term vision that this would be on stops, on signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4638)|
| 1:17:25| you know, sort of next bus arriving, I think you could even go out and really work to raise the visibility of transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4645)|
| 1:17:33| and partner with businesses that have, if they're close to a transit stop, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| next bus going northbound or southbound coming in so many minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| So I think it's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| UT, when they left the CAT contract years ago, they adopted it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| but I think it's an important step along with the Google Trip Planner, along with the Wi-Fi, of really raising the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4671)|
| 1:18:01| So I'm glad to see it and looking forward to its implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| So I just, I hate to make Ms. Sisler walk back to the mic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| but I just wondered, these are grants that we're approving, not actual funds to make these things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| And that being the case, when and how long are you, would it be from now that you will be notified whether we get the grant or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4699)|
| 1:18:28| The, you know, sometimes that just depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| I can't give you an exact date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Twelve months or 36 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| I would say less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| I would say less than 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| Hopefully it only takes about six months total for those to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| Now, as far as the money for, like, the passenger app, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| That's in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| We're ready to rock and roll with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| That's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| That's not a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| That's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| We've got the money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| And this will work with the current AVL?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| This will work with the current AVL as well as give us the ability for that real-time data to now be open data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4738)|
| 1:19:06| which will allow other folks to be able to write apps, which some people may come up with an even cooler app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| So this is a conversation you and I had about a year ago when I met with you, if you remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| I do remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| We talked to lots of people about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| So what we're approving on item T here is to actually purchase the SMS system to be able to do the app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4760)|
| 1:19:30| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| And then we've also approved grant money for a grant application, or we approved money for a new AVL system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| Well, what this is is you've approved the mayor to apply for the block grants that we talked about that are ahead of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4778)|
| 1:19:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| And then what happens is that you're also approving the city to put the match towards those grants up to 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4787)|
| 1:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| So but the new AVL that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| That's already paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4798)|

| 1:20:04| Those are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| That came from a prior technology grant that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| We're not dependent on grants for this to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Not for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| We are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4811)|

| 1:20:14| That money's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| We're moving on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4817)|

| 1:20:19| A done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Oh, and then just final last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| To address what Councilman Starr said about it, if you don't have a device, and let's say you're at an institution like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| Pellissippi Division Street or Magnolia, we could have a terminal in a lobby area and it could be on the web there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4825)|
| 1:20:36| I absolutely think that that could be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Well, we already have terminals sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| So it could be something that would be pulled up from the website there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| It doesn't have to be on a phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4846)|

| 1:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4853)|

| 1:20:58| 11U is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for and accept a grant award from the State of Tennessee Highway Safety Office in the amount of $50,000 with no required match for the purpose of funding overtime pay for additional patrols to identify and arrest individuals driving under the influence of drugs and or alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4858)|

| 1:21:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4880)|

| 1:21:24| May I ask a couple questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| I just wondered, is this because we don't have as many officers as we need to have right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4887)|
| 1:21:34| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| This is an opportunity for us to offer officers overtime to do more pointed, more directed DUI patrols in certain areas where we know we do have DUI patrols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4895)|
| 1:21:48| That frees up our patrol officers to be able to answer the calls for service while these other folks are doing the DUI enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| And is that something that the officers would like is overtime hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180327?start=4919)|
