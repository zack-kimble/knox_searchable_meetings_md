| 0:03:00| Briefly, I appreciate the opportunity to address Commission on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| The application was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| We were asking for planned residential at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Staff recommended four dwelling units per acre on this, and that's what Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=188)|

| 0:03:15| We are fine with the four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| This property is already zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| With the RA zone, you can do technically 4.3 units per acre with the RA zoning as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| The PR zoning, though, would allow us to cluster the properties, the residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| away from the industrial zone properties to the north and the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| The one condition is a type A landscaping screen to screen the residences that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| going to build from that industrial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| It gives us a little bit more flexibility without there being really any additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| impact than what the current zoning would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=230)|

| 0:04:00| I would just like to say I appreciate very much the involvement of Mr. Pfeiffer in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| and we've had probably three meetings about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| It's a five-acre tract, and I've also talked with Mr. Snowden about the access, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=251)|
| 0:04:20| seems like everyone has come to an agreement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=260)|
| 0:04:30| I do agree with the PR as opposed to RA after I saw the new plan drawn and realized that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| it does give an opportunity for more landscaping and also added some additional parking, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| was something we asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| So with all that said, I'd like to go ahead and make a motion that we approve PR up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=285)|

| 0:07:01| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=424)|

| 0:07:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| I was going to say that our rules do not allow that, but we will give you a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| after the fact to speak to some of the comments that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| During the Planning Commission meeting, it was the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| We had the opportunity, so I was just trying to follow suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| As I mentioned, I'm speaking on behalf of Red Door Homes and Balance Area Joint Ventures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| Point of order, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Don't we need to hear from Planning first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Even with opposition we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Director Brooks, if you would please read the Planning Recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the PR plan, residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=472)|

| 0:08:07| and would allow development compatible with the surrounding land uses and zoning patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| and zoning patterns subject to three conditions. Thank you. All right. Now you may go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=491)|
| 0:08:19| speak. Okay. My preparations are much as they were for the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| We do recognize the opposition from the neighborhood and in fact it's kind of neat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| in a way because it shows the true unity that we've all come to expect from Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| kudos for that. You know, our goal is to develop the property into single-family residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| they will be site-built, stick-built homes, not modular homes I think as was mentioned previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| We know that traffic is a concern for the community as well as architecture and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| Traffic seems to center around the intersection at Conda Drive and John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=534)|
| 0:09:01| Our property is unique in the fact that we front road frontage on three sides. We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| John Sevier Highway to the north, Conda Drive to the west, and Arthur Harmon to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| And we have concepts from where we could access the property from any one of those three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| intersections. We feel like the density that was approved and recommended by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| Commission is appropriate. We think the neighborhood or the property will support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| and we feel like the price point for the neighborhood will also support the type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| of development that we are trying to accomplish. I'll save my time for any rebuttal that I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| All right, thank you. Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=583)|
| 0:09:54| Yes, I was going to do that. Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| I had actually done my own timer on the last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| but I would appreciate it, Drew, if you could put the clock up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| Thank you. I think the rest of you need to run this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| Five minutes, please. Thank you. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| My name is Adam Montgomery. I am at 443 Carla Drive. It's in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, thank you for hearing us tonight. I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| want to thank Red Door for their hospitality as well. Our request is simple. We do realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| and we acknowledge that development will take place in front of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| and all that we request is that development is established and done with consistency given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| to what is already in place, both with residential density development and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| style and character of homes. Red Door has been amenable in working with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| and we do look forward to future communications with them to make sure that the style and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| character of what is already in place is honored and considered with their new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| We would simply request that the residential density be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| lowered to a two unit per acre as opposed to the proposed five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| Thank you very much. All right, thank you. Would you like to speak also, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| Just real quick. Jim Wright Jr., 421 Carla Drive. Just to follow up, our units are 1.82. Mr. Graff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=679)|
| 0:11:27| had figured that last time we talked about this, so we feel that two units per acre is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| consistent with what we are, and we just asked if we're going to be neighbors, we want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| good neighbors so we can work together. Thank you. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=696)|
| 0:11:44| Could I readdress? Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Okay, thank you. We recognize that the Woodfield development behind this proposed property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| a well-kept neighborhood, a beautiful, architecturally pleasing homes. We recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| that. They are roughly two dwelling units per acre, so roughly one per half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=719)|
| 0:12:09| They're brick homes largely, some combination split foyers, some basements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| It's a cost prohibitive type product to develop and deliver at this given time in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=734)|
| 0:12:21| building costs as they are. To do a 2,000 plus square foot home on a half acre lot with brick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| we're talking six to $800,000 homes. This market doesn't support that, and so we would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| like to mention that our site built, stick built homes, architecturally pleasing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| that we think that this property is supportive of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=762)|
| 0:12:50| Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Commissioners, do we have any comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| Has engineering determined what the best access to this development would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| We've looked at it tentatively. Obviously, Arthur Harmon Road is relatively narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=796)|
| 0:13:24| has a pretty sharp curve on it, plus you have a little, if you were to access at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| you have the additional conflict of Arthur Harmon that actually is a four-way intersection, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| we wouldn't necessarily control the access. TDOT would make that determination, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| if you were asking my opinion, I think the Conda Drive would probably be the best place. It would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| isolate the conflict points, and there is a left turn lane there, right turn lane drop, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=828)|
| 0:13:55| that would be my opinion, but it would be TDOT's call ultimately as far as what access they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| provide or allow. Okay. Do they listen to sometimes to your recommendations? For sure. I mean, we try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| to work together and want to be good teammates, so I would think they would be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| to listen to our concerns. Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| Oh, I'm sorry. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| Yes, Commissioner Daly. Thank you, Madam Chair. To follow up on Commissioner Schoonmaker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| questioning, Arthur Harmon would not be really an ideal road to enter or exit. It's at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| of a steep ravine. That ravine's going to have to be filled in, so that entrance is out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| question. TDOT has informed us that if there's access to another road that leads into Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=884)|
| 0:14:53| John Sevier, they would prefer that access, which leaves only one access, and that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| that Conda or Carla Drive there. Also, across the, you know, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=900)|
| 0:15:09| Commissioner Durrett will remember this. When she first came on board, across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| there was a request for four to five per acre, and you went out there. All that property drained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| across the road, drains down to Arthur Harmon down in that little stream right there, which is full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| of limestone caves out there, and we turned that one down at three per acre, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| All that just because of what it could do, not just because, but what it could do to the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=933)|
| 0:15:41| of the residents down the stream. Now, all this water will drain east to Burnett's Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| and Burnett's Creek will drain into Fort Loudon. Fort Loudon Lake is the direction that it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| There's three conditions here that are very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| At John Sevier, you must maintain a 50-foot buffer there. Your lot width is only about 244 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=957)|
| 0:16:06| Yes, sir. So, that's 50 feet off of that, so you're less than 190 feet already. You're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| to have to have a 28-foot road. Yes, sir. Down the middle of it. Yes, sir. Down that, fill that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| ravine all in right there, which will change the water table, the way the water runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| You're really going to have to have short lots if you wanted to go to five. Yes, sir. Very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=981)|
| 0:16:30| very short lots, and that requires a variance. I would think it would require for some type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| of variance, and I'm not for variances at all. Developers develop land, and they develop it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| sometimes with too much density, where they got to go to BZA and say, hey, I can't build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| the house my customer wants because the lot's too small. That's not BZA's issue. Yes, sir. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| we're not here to see that a developer makes money in the first place. So, you're going to lose 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| feet there. You're going to lose, on number three, you're going to have to do a type B landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| of 12 feet in depth around those, or you're losing another 20 feet. So, this five acres really goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| narrow right down the middle. It does. That's why we've been working on concept plans to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| that. Well, your concept plans show 21 homes in the beginning? That's one of three that we have, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| So, and the 50 foot is still part of the lot. It's just that it can't be touched due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| to the scenic highway corridor. So, the lot depth is still significant. It's just that the usable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| space within setbacks is challenging, and we recognize that. And that's where your variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| will come in because somebody's going to want a backyard, and they ain't going to have a backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| They will have a nice backyard, I believe. That's my opinion. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| not here to debate that. So, you know, it drops from, I think, 950 feet on the contour down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1072)|
| 0:18:03| 830. I'm just trying to go by memory. You're going to have to fill that ravine in, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| Well, it's not. There's a drainage easement that comes across from John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| that we've incorporated into our plan. It does designate a couple of areas as common space in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| order to allow for that drainage to be curtailed. But I don't think the contour is quite as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| significant. I've walked the property very carefully, and in studies with our engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| it seems very doable to us, sir. And to address the curve in Arthur Harmon, we would bring the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| entrance closer to that curve, so you'd have a line of sight in each direction. It might not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| to be quite that great on the Conda End Drive if we go with the through road idea. Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1124)|
| 0:18:52| I still don't see that Arthur Harmon would have an interest, even if he moves it right on the edge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| of the boundary of the line. That's too close to the intersection, wouldn't it be? It would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| pretty close, and, you know, Arthur Harmon's a pretty narrow road. On this particular segment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| I think a developer on the north end widened it. Our concern would be for folks to make a ride out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| of that entrance and go down the hill to Sevierville Pike, and that road was very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| So, I mean, if they wanted access to Arthur Harmon on that portion, we would probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| asking for them to do some improvements to Arthur Harmon to make sure that the residents that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| there now are not negatively harmed. We don't know how much right-of-way they would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| purchase to do that, because usually on narrow roads like that in South Knoxville, if it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| being sold, some of the lines will go to the center of the road. So, do you know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| right-of-way might be? Do you think it'd be 20 feet on that narrow of a road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| Most likely, yeah. And, you know, look at it, it don't have a centerline stripe on it, so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| probably less than 16 feet. We just, you know, and I'm not sure, I mean, I think we talked about 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| lots here, so they're not introducing a lot of traffic on that road, but just due to the proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| intersection and the width of the existing road and the challenges to widen that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| my department wouldn't be inclined to recommend a direct access point on Arthur Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| Thank you, sir. You know, I want to see, and the neighbors are not against the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| I want to see development. I want John Sevier Highway to stay as scenic as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| Yes, sir. A scenic highway, by the state regulations, is no billboards, no junkyards, and no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1238)|
| 0:20:47| buildings over 35 feet in height. I think it's the only three homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| We support all those things as well, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| People think a scenic highway, you can't build anything on. Yes, you can still build, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| just can't have certain things there. I am not at all for five or four or three. If you can make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| where I'm going to make the motion for two, because I think, I know that. I've had friends that lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| in that subdivision for years. We used to run around, play there, and all that good stuff, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1271)|

| 0:21:27| was 50 years ago, so I'm going to make a motion. Commissioner Schoonmaker, you got another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| Before I make a motion, I'll yield to Commissioner Schoonmaker or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1295)|
| 0:21:44| Thank you, Commissioner. Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| When you were describing the density and you referenced a Mr. Graff, I don't think the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| of this body know who that individual is or was in relationship to zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1319)|
| 0:22:07| He was on the previous planning commission. He was a South Knoxville builder, and he was on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| previous planning commission, and he did a lot of research as far as our neighborhood went and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| divided it all out and figured it all up, and he came up with 1.82 units per acre is what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| subdivision is, so he's kind of the guru of South Knoxville, but he was on the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1344)|
| 0:22:33| previously. Okay, and was this property in play a number of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| at all? Is this the first time this has ever come up? No, this was what he brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| This property, when it came up a couple years ago, is when he decided to do the calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| and do the figuring and make the suggestion for two units per acre or 1.75. Okay, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| all righty. Okay, thank you. Yes, sir. Thank you, Madam Chair. Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| Hold on, are you finished? Well, I was just going to say, did you want to have your people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1389)|

| 0:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| Director Brooks? May I say before the motion is made, it seems to me that a lot of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| questions that we have, drainage, lot depth, setbacks, etc., should fall under use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| Can we not preserve our density as recommended by planning commission until we're proven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| otherwise through use and review process? That would be my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1427)|
| 0:23:58| You can certainly make that request. I believe, though, that it's the preview of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| board to make the vote on density, though. Thank you, just making the observation. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| All right. Commissioner Daly? Thank you, Madam Chair. Director Brooks can confirm this if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1449)|
| 0:24:17| wrong, but this piece of property was brought up for rezoning back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1457)|
| 0:24:26| 19. It was withdrawn, if I'm not mistaken, before it came to a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| and I don't think the vote back then would have been two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| It was brought back. It was brought up in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Looks like it was originally submitted in April of that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1483)|
| 0:24:52| It was a recommendation. Let me just go through the old case real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1492)|
| 0:25:01| Planning commission recommended that county commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| plan residential up to three units per acre, and it was withdrawn before you all heard it, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1504)|
| 0:25:12| And then in this year, 9B03, RZ is withdrawn again. I don't know what that was about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1512)|
| 0:25:20| but I do remember the one in 19 being withdrawn because of the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| I still don't see four or five or three, even three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| Is this commission's prerogative to set density? I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1531)|
| 0:25:38| It is this commission's prerogative to set density, not use a review or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| Being a lifelong resident of South Knoxville, I feel that two is adequate to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| so I'm going to make the motion to approve it two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| We have a motion on the floor by Daly, second by Frazier. Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| I do have a question for Director Brooks. Did I hear you to say that in 2019 you recommended up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1568)|
| 0:26:16| to three per acre? Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| And this recommendation is up to five per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| Four, it was up to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Up to, what was the recommendation by planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1591)|
| 0:26:31| Both times it's been recommended at five, ma'am. I have the records right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| All right, hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| It was planning, staff planning recommendation was five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Yes, planning's recommendations for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Planning commission, I apologize. The planning commission's recommendation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| to rezone up to five dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Okay, and I'm just, hold on please. I'm just curious, has what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| do you have any idea why that recommendation would change in the last four years from three to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1623)|
| 0:27:13| Is it just a different, different people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| The planning staff recommendation back in 2019 was to, hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| I have to look at the case, the old case file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1649)|
| 0:27:39| Staff's recommendation in 2019 was to approve up to five dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| subject to the, subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| And then the recommendation from planning commission to county commission was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| rezone up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| And that was withdrawn. Is that what I understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1683)|

| 0:28:11| Confirming what she said. In both cases, the planning staff has recommended five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| And then at the 2019 hearing, it was approved at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| That was withdrawn. Again, they recommended five this most recent time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| which they did approve 11 to two at a PR five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=1707)|

| 0:34:49| but I believe part of it was owned by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| And I think there's a commercial mulching operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| right now on the property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2094)|

| 0:35:26| So it's kind of right there at the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2126)|

| 0:35:36| I just wanted to point out in the proposed growth policy plan map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| this parcel is, it maintains its current land use of ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2141)|
| 0:35:52| So I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2155)|
| 0:36:04| I'd like to make a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| And the comment is that I've had no comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| I do know that there's a huge plan by the state and Commissioner, or Director Stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| I might ask you just to address exactly what that plan is right down there at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| very close to where we're talking about changing the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Currently at Joe Daniels, there isn't a left turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| It kind of tapers right there at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| The state project will install a left turn lane at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| And then immediately to the west of that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| they're going to revamp that interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| build some new bridges, and actually build a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| I believe it's a diverging diamond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| And then we're also going to connect Solway Road over into the interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| to kind of create a fully functional interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| so that folks don't have those very strange U-turns along Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| like they currently do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| So that project's funded in the Improve Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| but obviously it's pretty significant in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Maybe a few years off, but it is in the works with TDOT and it is funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Seeing no other lights, I'm going to make them a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| that we approve rural residential land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| because it's consistent with surrounding land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2255)|
| 0:37:44| That is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2264)|

| 0:39:19| Would you like to say anything to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Yes, and the one condition is that slopes of 25 percent or greater be left undisturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| and there are some significant slopes in the middle part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| and those are going to be avoided and that's just fine with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| You know, this is through Planned Residential, three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| We don't have a development plan that's in place yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| We're still, you know, looking at exactly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| what we want to do with property now, how we want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| You know, a lot of that, you know, I think is going to depend on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| what TDOT does with that interchange and the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| But, you know, this will allow us to be creative and deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| you know, the environmental constraints that are on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| and there's some really beautiful views on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| It'll make some wonderful home sites on that property with access, you know, to the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| And so I think it would make a really nice development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| once we can kind of figure out exactly what we can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2417)|

| 0:40:27| Ben, I'm looking at this ridgetop hill slope down there in that left-hand corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| You might not have seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| I looked at it, but it's kind of got a little small square down in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| Is that going to be part of the development too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Are you talking about in the kind of the little square in the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| in the kind of the southwest corner of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Yes, that's part of the property that's owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| It don't look like a large piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| but it's just kind of weird the way the property lays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| Yeah, there's several different parcels that we've combined under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| you know, single ownership for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Just wondering about the shape of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| Mr. Mullins, did I hear you say that you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| waiting for a concept plan until you got more definite?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| We don't have a concept plan or development plan in place to know exactly what we can develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| I do know there's precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| There was some property to the kind of the northeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| that was approved from Planning Commission at three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| When they actually got in there and started looking at the similar topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| they came back with 2.2, and you often see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| You'll get the density at zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| but the concept or the development plan comes in at less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| But at this point, I don't know what that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| The three units an acre will give us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| the kind of flexibility to work with some of the hillside issues that are on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2514)|

| 0:43:54| and would allow development compatible with the surrounding land uses and zoning pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2634)|

| 0:44:02| Would you like to speak to your project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| First, I'd like to thank the Commission for hearing my request and justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| I'm going to be asking for a little bit higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| And if you'll bear with me, I'm going to read this so I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| get on a rabbit trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| So I'm here today to request that Knox County Commission's approval would approve 3.75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| I originally applied for four units per acre, but only received an NPC recommendation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| Ultimately, I only need 3.75 units per acre approval, which would yield 59 lots for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| subject development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Some bullet points to justify my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| We currently own the adjoining community next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| Its name is Sparks Meadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| It was zoned for PR three units an acre for up to 60 units, but we only developed it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| 1.95 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| So that's 39 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| NPC originally thought that having a unified development between the two communities, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| existing Sparks Meadows and the subject property with some shared connectivity would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| for shared density for a combined 2.7 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| After the NPC recommendation of the meeting of three units per acre, I met with NPC for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| further discussion on how to accomplish this shared density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| Upon further review, NPC determined that I would have to have a connected road for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| to be considered for shared density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| However, a connected road would not be possible because the existing community that the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| has already been paved is a private road and it's going to be a private gated community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| The subject development is planned to be a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| Therefore, it's not feasible to accomplish a connected road between the two communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| and properly comply with the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| So today, I'm requesting for a density of 3.75 units per acre for this subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| independently without association with the adjoining development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| With this approval, I will only have a combined shared density of 2.7 units per acre for both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| So thank you for hearing my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2781)|

| 0:48:15| I went out and looked at, I even parked and walked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| This is an area that is benefiting or not depending on how you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| From the Chad Road connector and it is just absolutely exploded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| However, I have to say that Mr. Worley has done a lot of building in that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=2914)|

| 0:52:45| To me, it sounds like it might be a group home or some type of rehabilitation home or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Am I wrong there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3172)|

| 0:53:03| and we just have it on our heart to be able to provide affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| Our mission of A Step Towards Home, I wrote it down so I could share it with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| Our non-profit's mission and core distinctive purpose of A Step Towards Home is transforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| lives by developing a continuum of supportive and affordable housing solutions while creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| a path towards home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| In this property specifically, we would like to be able to use this as providing what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| would think is what is really needed in the area of some affordable home ownership for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| first-time homebuyers, some affordable rentals, and then some homes that we would use for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| Each project, as we work through the development plan, would have a purpose of showing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| continuum of support for helping our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3237)|
| 0:53:57| Do you all build the homes yourself, or is it like a Habitat for Humanity home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| So thank you all for your time, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| So I'm a general contractor, and my niche is spec homes, and we operate in the affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| market, so I've become pretty efficient with approximately 1,200 square foot homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes, two-car garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| This particular project, we see an opportunity because of the ownership of the land that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| We own a couple of the old open arms care group homes that we lease out to the Lazarus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3281)|
| 0:54:41| So in this particular project, they cater to men coming out of Tennessee Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| Corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| So a step towards home, essentially, is what our role is, is we are affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| inventory providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| We're not service providers, but in this particular case, we would, with our model, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| could adhere to this cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| It could also adhere to causes such as disabled veterans, battered women, children phasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| out of the foster program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| So really, we see a need in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| There's just no inventory in the affordable space, and we want to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| This particular property, because of its location in relation to our property, it fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| I'm proud of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3335)|

| 0:55:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| I just wanted to point out that much of the industrial zoning in this area is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3343)|
| 0:55:50| to be changed to a suburban residential and suburban mixed residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| So this would be very appropriate in this area, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| I looked on your website, and you said that you create affordable housing inventory while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3367)|
| 0:56:16| providing a step toward home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| So what exactly does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3385)|

| 0:57:25| I've not touched alcohol or drugs since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Since then, through a series of events, good choice after good choice, I met my wife after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3447)|

| 1:00:13| the official, Kendra, at a steptowardshome.com, and it was supposed to forward, and we never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| got the forwarding email, so I'm so sorry that we had missed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| That was our bad that we're trying to figure out the technology side of starting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3623)|

| 1:00:33| I do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| I did hear you say, though, that you're not doing any kind of a treatment modality, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| that it is strictly just housing that you're offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| We want to be able to provide the continuum of support in what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| The Lazarus Project is already at those group homes, that's what they provide, but currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| they have 300 people on their waiting list, and they had six people graduate last...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| Or they had eight people graduate last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Six of them said they wanted to stay in the transitional track, but they don't have housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| for the transitional track, and that's six beds that could be opened up for that waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| So what we really see is a need for the next step of housing, that it's not the recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| program, it is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| People call it different things, but how do we provide that as a support and an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| for them that's affordable, that they can still have community and responsibility, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| that's what we're looking at when putting together a development plan of how we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| We're working through those details of how all of this comes together, but ideally, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| we were allowed to get the zoning, that would allow us for putting what we would feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| would fit best in that area of not doing high-density...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| Our plan, just to be transparent, is we'd like to build stick-built, permanent foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| kind of like micro cottages, like smaller efficiencies, and maybe like two touching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3714)|
| 1:02:01| each other, and then kind of like a little cloverleaf of here's one little pod and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| little pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3727)|
| 1:02:07| And we'll create a community up at the top of the transitional housing, and then down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| at the bottom would be the affordable rentals that we would like to see if that could work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| for a tax credit project, that would be affordable rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| That sounds wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| This is a great way to end zoning at Christmas time for people who are wanting to do stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3753)|
| 1:02:33| I think we can all agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| I know that we're seeing it a lot in my district, which is next door to your district, or your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| area of homelessness and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| So I really commend you guys for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| And it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| I would not hold you to this, so don't think that I'm asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| But I'm curious, when you say affordable housing, what are you kind of thinking price-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| We're working to see if this project could work for a 9% LIHTC deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| So that would make sure that we stay in compliance of keeping this affordable for at least 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| to 30 years, depending on how the project would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| But our intentions fully are to be able to provide what is really needed and what other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| developers aren't building, is the two-bedroom, the smaller efficiencies where the rent can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| be affordable and attainable, and not just market rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| So when we're looking at the project, we're looking at putting together a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| team that has the experience with the LIHTC part, that this application would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| us, because it's very hard to make affordable housing development projects work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| The other experts are saying the only way to fund affordable housing projects with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| way that the market is right now is with potential tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| So that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| And that would make us stay in compliance and keep things affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| And so you're going to have some houses, and then you'll have some apartments, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| for people that can rent that's not quite to the point of being able to do homeownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3842)|
| 1:04:02| And we do plan on building some homes that would also be for homeownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| So that there's one little section where we're building a few houses, and the profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| of those would help us roll into the nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| And then the rentals also, our vision of this property is that we're not building an apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| complex, that this is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| It's allowed for cluster development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| And that we're building it more with the way of the land and kind of like a condo development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| like a planned unit development, that you could drive through that community, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| would know that's not an affordable complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| That's a community of you wouldn't know the difference between the houses that we sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| and the houses that are rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| That also comes into play of the cost of development and the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| But that's our vision and our goal of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| Well, I want to commend you, and I appreciate your heart and willing to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3888)|

| 1:04:59| And I know that you're going to be able to help a lot of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3901)|

| 1:05:29| I just had a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| So is the selection process going to go through you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| How do you determine who would qualify or be able to move in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| So can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218-zoning?start=3945)|
